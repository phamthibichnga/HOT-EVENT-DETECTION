After his wartime exploits in forgery, he became a photographer and photography teacher.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHis talent for creating realistic documents helped children, their parents and others escape deportation to concentration camps, and in many cases to flee Nazi-occupied territory.\n\nAdolfo Kaminsky\u2019s talent was as banal as could be: He knew how to remove supposedly indelible blue ink from paper. But it was a skill that helped save the lives of thousands of Jews in France during World War II. He had learned how to remove such stains as a teenager working for a clothes dyer and dry cleaner in his Normandy town. When he joined the anti-Nazi resistance at 18, his expertise enabled him to erase Jewish-sounding names like Abraham or Isaac that were officially inscribed on French ID and food ration cards, and substitute them with typically gentile-sounding ones. The forged documents allowed Jewish children, their parents and others to escape deportation to Auschwitz and other concentration camps, and in many cases to flee Nazi-occupied territory for safe havens. At one point, Mr. Kaminsky was asked to produce 900 birth and baptismal certificates and ration cards for 300 Jewish children in institutional homes who were about to be rounded up. The aim was to deceive the Germans until the children could be smuggled out to rural families or convents, or to Switzerland and Spain. He was given three days to finish the assignment.\n\nHe toiled for two straight days, forcing himself to stay awake by telling himself: \u201cIn one hour I can make 30 blank documents. If I sleep for an hour 30 people will die.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky died on Monday at his home in Paris, his daughter Sarah Kaminsky said. He was 97. His story reads like something out of a spy novel. Using the pseudonym Julien Keller, Mr. Kaminsky was a key operative in a Paris underground laboratory whose members \u2014 all working for no pay and risking a quick death if discovered \u2014 adopted aliases like Water Lily, Penguin and Otter, and often contrived documents from scratch. Mr. Kaminsky learned to fashion various typefaces, a skill he had picked up in elementary school while editing a school newspaper, and was able to imitate those used by the authorities. He pressed paper so that it, too, resembled the kind used on official documents, and photoengraved his own rubber stamps, letterheads and watermarks.\n\nAfter Paris was liberated, Mr. Kaminsky went to work for the revived French government, where he fabricated documents that allowed intelligence agents to penetrate Nazi territory in order to gather evidence about the death camps. He continued to forge documents for three decades after the war, aiding insurgents in British-mandate Palestine, French Algeria, South Africa and Latin America. He also fabricated papers for Americans trying to evade the military draft during the Vietnam War. \u201cI saved lives because I can\u2019t deal with unnecessary deaths \u2014 I just can\u2019t,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2016. \u201cAll humans are equal, whatever their origins, their beliefs, their skin color. There are no superiors, no inferiors. That is not acceptable for me.\u201d Mr. Kaminsky was the subject that year of an Emmy Award-winning documentary short, \u201cThe Forger,\u201d produced by The Times\u2019s Opinion section.\n\nAdolfo Kaminsky was born on Oct. 1, 1925, in Buenos Aires. His parents, Salomon and Anna (Kino\u00ebl) Kaminsky, were Russian Jews who met in Paris in 1916. His mother had fled the pogroms in Russia; his father was a journalist for a Jewish Marxist newspaper. When the Bolsheviks overthrew the czarist government, France expelled sympathizers of the new regime, and the Kaminskys fled to Argentina, where their two other sons were also born. By the early 1930s, the Kaminskys were able to return to France and settle in the town of Vire in Normandy. Adolfo left school at 13 to help an uncle run his market stall, but finding him overbearing, the boy left to work in a factory that made airplane instruments. The Germans invaded France in 1940. They took over the Normandy factory and dismissed all Jewish workers. Needing work to help his family, Adolfo answered an ad for an apprentice dyer in a business that converted military uniforms and greatcoats to civilian wear. The owner, a chemical engineer, taught him the secrets of altering and removing colors. Adolfo became an expert at effacing the most stubborn stains. He became so interested in chemistry that he took a side job as an assistant for a chemist at a dairy that churned butter. To gauge the fat content of the cream brought by farmers, the dairy would insert methylene blue in a sample and waited for its lactic acid to dissolve the color. That was how Adolfo learned that lactic acid was the best eraser of Waterman blue ink, the kind used on ID cards. In 1941, the Kaminskys were arrested and sent to Drancy, an internment camp near Paris that was a way station to the death camps. Thanks to their Argentine passports, they were released after three months. But the family soon feared that those passports would no longer protect them, and so Adolfo, by then 18, was dispatched to secure documents from the French underground that would disguise the fact that they were Jews. When the resistance agents learned of his expertise, they recruited him. A memoir, told in his voice but written by his daughter Sarah Kaminsky and published in English in 2016 with the title \u201cAdolfo Kaminsky: A Forger\u2019s Life,\u201d chronicles how Mr. Kaminsky began his resistance work in earnest after learning that his mother had been killed on a train returning from Paris, where she had gone to warn her brother of his impending arrest. Furious, he committed several acts of sabotage, using chemicals to rust railway equipment and corrode transmission lines.\n\nHe had sought vengeance, he said, and needed \u201cconsolation for his sadness.\u201d \u201cFor the first time I didn\u2019t feel entirely impotent,\u201d he said. Forging documents was perilous work. Once, on the Paris Metro, a policeman approached him to inspect his satchel, which contained blank identity documents and forging tools. Thinking fast, Mr. Kaminsky told him that it contained sandwiches and asked him if he wanted one. The policeman moved on. But several of Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s underground colleagues were arrested and killed, and the strain of doing such painstaking work for hours on end cost him his sight in one eye. His first marriage, in 1950, to Jeanine Korngold, ended in divorce in 1952. He married Leila Bendjebour in 1974. In addition to his daughter Sarah, from his second marriage, Mr. Kaminsky is survived by his wife; their two sons, Atahualpa and Jos\u00e9-Youcef; a daughter from his first marriage, Marthe; a sister, Pauline Gerlich; and nine grandchildren. A son from his first marriage, Serge, died of a heart attack in 2021. In a 2010 talk in Paris, Sarah Kaminsky recalled her first glimpse of her father\u2019s life as a forger. She had received a bad grade in school, she said, and needed her mother\u2019s signature as proof that she had informed her parents. So she faked it. Her mother quickly perceived a forgery and rebuked her, but her father responded with a laugh. \u201cBut really, Sarah, you could have worked harder,\u201d he said of her effort. \u201cCan\u2019t you see it\u2019s really too small?\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRogue emissions from China of ozone-depleting chemicals had threatened to delay recovery by a decade. But the emissions were stopped, according to a U.N.-backed report.\n\nThe weakened ozone layer, which is vital to protecting life on Earth, is on track to be restored to full strength within decades \u2014 the latest success of a global effort by nations to stop using chemicals that had been destroying the critical layer in the upper atmosphere. In a report for the United Nations, scientists said Monday that China had largely eliminated rogue emissions of one of those chemicals, known as CFC-11. Once widely used as a refrigerant and in foam insulation, CFC-11 was first synthesized a century ago. Along with similar chemicals, collectively called chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-11 destroys ozone, which blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer and otherwise harm people, plants and animals. Chlorofluorocarbons were banned under the Montreal Protocol, a landmark environmental agreement that took effect in 1989. If countries continue to maintain the bans on chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, ozone levels between the polar regions should reach pre-1980 levels by 2040. Ozone holes, or regions of greater depletion that appear regularly near the South Pole and, less frequently, near the North Pole, should also recover, by 2045 in the Arctic and about 2066 in Antarctica.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of the ozone layer is on track,\u201d said David W. Fahey, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Chemical Sciences Laboratory and a co-chairman of the protocol\u2019s scientific assessment panel. \u201cThe peak destruction of the global ozone layer is behind us due to the effectiveness of the control measures of the Montreal Protocol that have been adopted by all nations.\u201d In the 1970s, scientists first determined that chlorofluorocarbons were depleting ozone high in the atmosphere. By the mid-1980s, researchers discovered a hole in the ozone over the Antarctic, sparking an urgent international effort to repair it. More than 100 ozone-depleting compounds were eventually banned and phased out. The Chinese emissions had threatened to delay restoration of the ozone layer by a decade but the new report said it had only been put off by a year. Exxon\u2019s climate research. A new study published in the journal Science found that starting in the late 1970s, Exxon\u2019s scientists made remarkably accurate projections of just how much burning fossil fuels would warm the planet. Yet for years, the oil giant publicly cast doubt on climate science, and cautioned against any drastic move toward alternative resources. A controversial appointment. The decision by the United Arab Emirates to select the head of its national oil company to oversee the COP28 climate talks in Dubai this year has drawn ire from environmental groups. The move reflects the complex balancing act the United Arab Emirates is trying to pull off as the oil exporter prepares for a renewable future. Eight hot years. Scientists from the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that the last eight years were the warmest on record. Extreme summer temperatures in Europe, China and elsewhere contributed to 2022 being the fifth-hottest year on record; 2016 was the hottest year ever. U.S. carbon emissions. America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry rose last year, moving the nation in the opposite direction from its climate goals, according to preliminary estimates by a nonpartisan research firm. Emissions ticked up 1.3 percent, even as renewable energy surpassed coal power nationwide for the first time in over six decades. Parasitic populations According to a groundbreaking new study that analyzed 85 parasitic species, the majority of them suffered population declines over 140 years. The decline, seemingly driven by warming temperatures, suggests another unexpected way that climate change can harm ecosystems. \u201cThe emissions dropped amazingly abruptly,\u201d said Stephen A. Montzka, a NOAA research chemist and one of the report\u2019s authors. The delay in recovery \u201cis a lot smaller than it could have been if the emissions persisted,\u201d he added. Emissions of CFC-11 began increasing after 2012 and appeared to come from East Asia, according to a 2018 study by Dr. Montzka. Investigations by The New York Times and others strongly suggested that small factories in Eastern China were the source of the rogue emissions.\n\nAt the time, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, which oversees the protocol, called illegal production of CFC-11 \u201cnothing short of an environmental crime which demands decisive action.\u201d But a follow-up study in 2019 showed that emissions were declining, a sign that the Chinese government was cracking down on new production of CFC-11. The Chinese CFC-11 was very likely used as a blowing agent in making foam insulation. During foam production, some of the CFC-11 escapes into the atmosphere, where it can be detected and measured, but much of it is contained within the foam as it hardens. In this way, the researchers said, the Chinese rogue production had contributed to the \u201cbanks\u201d of chlorofluorocarbons that were produced worldwide before the ban went into effect and are in foams as well as refrigeration equipment and fire-extinguishing systems. These existing chemicals are not yet in the atmosphere, but are being released slowly through foam deterioration and destruction, leaks or other means. Dr. Montzka said the size of the Chinese contribution to the banks was not known. \u201cBut if the banks have been built up substantially, that would add a few more years to that expected delay in recovery,\u201d he said. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, a Washington-based research and advocacy organization, said the elimination of the rogue emissions was another example of the success of the protocol, which is generally considered to be the most effective global environmental pact ever enacted. Atmospheric monitoring, which is required by the protocol, detected the problem, Mr. Zaelke said, and brought it to the attention of the treaty\u2019s directorate. \u201cWithout admitting guilt, the offending parties got their act together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the measurements are back where they should be.\u201d\n\nUnder the protocol, assessments like the one issued Monday are required at least every four years. In addition to NOAA scientists, contributors included researchers with NASA, the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Environment Program and the European Commission. The new assessment also considered, for the first time, the effects on ozone of a potential type of climate intervention, or geoengineering. The method, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, is meant to cool the atmosphere by using airplanes or other means to distribute sulfur aerosols to reflect some of the sun\u2019s rays before they reach the surface. The idea has drawn fierce opposition. Among other objections, opponents say that intervening in the climate in this way could have severe unintended consequences, potentially altering weather patterns worldwide. But many scientists and others say that at the least, research is needed, because warming may reach a point where the world becomes desperate to try such an intervention technique, perhaps temporarily to buy time before greenhouse gas reductions can have a significant effect. Dr. Fahey of NOAA said that some studies had shown an impact on ozone of sulfur aerosols, so the assessment team was given the task of looking into it. The protocol \u201cexists to protect the ozone layer, and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of it in dealing with ozone-depleting substances,\u201d he said. Looking at stratospheric aerosol injection, \u201cis in our wheelhouse,\u201d he added. There is a lot of uncertainty in their findings, Dr. Fahey said, but the basic message is that trying to cool the planet by 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit), say, through the use of sulfur aerosols, would have some effect on ozone. But it \u201cwill not destroy the ozone layer and create catastrophic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually already knew that because Mount Pinatubo did the experiment for us,\u201d he said, referring to the huge volcanic explosion in the Philippines in 1991 that sent enormous amounts of sulfur gas into the stratosphere, creating an aerosol haze akin to a geoengineering effort.",

(The book mistakenly appeared in stores early in Spain, and was snapped up and translated by alert members of the British news media, injecting an element of chaos into the publisher\u2019s rollout.) Harry and Meghan still have many sympathizers, particularly those who see the couple\u2019s grievances through the lens of the racism Meghan encountered in Britain and who say that she \u2014 and Harry, once he married her \u2014 never stood a chance in such a stultified, reactionary institution as the monarchy. But something has changed, judging from the response so far. Even in the United States, which has a soft spot for royals in exile and a generally higher tolerance than Britain does for redemptive stories about overcoming trauma and family dysfunction, there is a sense that there are only so many revelations the public can stomach.\n\n\u201cLook, everyone has a family,\u201d the television host Don Lemon declared on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d last week. \u201cI have arguments in my family. Am I going to put that out there for the whole world to see? I don\u2019t understand why on earth he would want to put that out there. I know he\u2019s selling a book, but to me it\u2019s just \u2026\u201d (\u201cGauche,\u201d he added later.) Was it gauche, for instance, for Harry to accuse Prince William of pushing him to the floor while the two argued about Meghan, ripping Harry\u2019s necklace and shattering a dog\u2019s bowl whose shards then gouged his back? Or to describe how the brothers squabbled in front of their father after Prince Philip\u2019s funeral? (\u201cPlease, boys, don\u2019t make my final years a misery,\u201d Charles is quoted as saying.) How about Harry\u2019s account of how, high on mushrooms, he believed a garbage can was talking to him, or the passage about how Meghan offended Kate, the Princess of Wales, by boldly asking if she could borrow her lip gloss? It\u2019s one thing to be criticized; it\u2019s another to be openly ridiculed.\n\nIt can\u2019t be a great sign, for instance, that the Jimmy Kimmel show last week staged a re-enactment of the supposed argument in the kitchen that it called \u201cTwo Princes.\u201d Set to a voice-over of an actor reading the passage in a plummy English accent, the skit featured two actors who were, bizarrely, each dressed as the musician Prince. On the other side of the Atlantic, four media personalities on the couch of the British show \u201cThis Morning\u201d could barely keep it together last week as they discussed another revelation in the book, Harry\u2019s account of the first time he had sex.\n\n\u201cAn older woman took his virginity and then, when the act of darkness had been completed, he lay on his front and she smacked his bottom,\u201d said one, the writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, to peals of laughter. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies Preorders have already catapulted the book to the top of best-seller lists, and the ubiquitous coverage is unlikely to damage sales, at least in the short term. \u201cI\u2019m sure they don\u2019t mind all the publicity,\u201d said Jeffrey W. Schneider, a co-founder of the public relations firm The Lead PR, speaking of the book\u2019s publisher, Penguin Random House. \u201cIt is also true that what is good for a publisher is not necessarily the same as what is good for the person who has published the book.\u201d Indeed, more worrying for Harry and Meghan is whether the continued public re-litigation of their troubles has grown so repetitive or even tiresome that it has eroded their personal brand and damaged their potential future earnings. Once they have exhausted the topic of themselves, what is left for them to talk about? \u201cIt\u2019s overload,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot about them, and now there\u2019s a lot more. While people\u2019s fascination has always been pretty high, maybe there is a natural limit to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to realize that you can really only tell your story once,\u201d Bragman said. There is also the question of timing. Harry\u2019s book is being published shortly after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. Whatever you think of the monarchy, Elizabeth\u2019s funeral gave the royal family the chance to showcase qualities like discretion, fortitude, an adherence to duty and tradition, and an aptitude for remaining publicly stoic in the face of private grief. But Harry embodies the opposite of all that. With his revelations about private family conversations, his accounts of his anguish and unhappiness at the behavior of his father, stepmother and brother, especially in the wake of his mother\u2019s death, and his eagerness to divulge un-regal details about topics like Meghan and Kate\u2019s high-drama altercation over the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses at his and Meghan\u2019s wedding, he presents a stark contrast to William and, especially, to Kate, who in public have said exactly nothing about any of this. \u201cIt feels a little reality-television-y to me,\u201d Bragman said of the Harry-and-Meghan media offensive. The couple, he added, \u201cfeel a little Trumpian, in that they seem like they can\u2019t let a grudge go.\u201d Alas, even one of the queens of reality television, the former \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star Bethenny Frankel, believes that Harry and Meghan have finally said too much. \u201cIs it too late to change the name of Harry\u2019s book to \u2018Dirty Harry Laundry?\u2019\u201d Frankel said in a video on Instagram, filming herself as she lay in bed. She decried the level of detail in the book. \u201cHow much more? Are we going with Meghan to get a Pap smear? I mean, what\u2019s next?\u201d (\u201cOkay, but how is this any different than the reality shows that you did?\u201d a commenter named wendyjo79 responded, which seemed like a fair point.) Many people have defended Meghan and Harry on social media and elsewhere in the last few days. But for every person who sticks up for the couple, there is someone else who says that enough is enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve all just fallen down some wormhole where we will never be free of hearing every single detail of Prince Harry\u2019s life and why he believes no one has ever had a worse life than his,\u201d the former \u201cView\u201d co-host Meghan McCain said on Twitter. \u201cThis is never going to end. He\u2019s never going to let us live!\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMisconduct claims against Judge Harriet Thompson of Brooklyn Surrogate\u2019s Court were scheduled to be considered at a hearing next week.\n\nA Brooklyn judge accused of making racist and homophobic remarks about court workers, fellow judges and others has agreed to give up her seat on the bench, officials said on Monday. The judge, Harriet L. Thompson of Brooklyn Surrogate\u2019s Court, was set to face a misconduct hearing next week. In a legal filing, a top New York judge wrote that Judge Thompson said that \u201cbeing gay is an abomination to mankind\u201d and that Hispanic people had a \u201cdeceitful trait that goes way back to biblical times.\u201d Those comments and others, most of which Judge Thompson, 67, denied making but which an inspector general\u2019s inquiry substantiated, helped form the basis of a formal complaint filed against her last year with the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. The complaint also said that she had failed to administer Surrogate\u2019s Court matters in a timely way since taking her seat in 2019. Surrogate\u2019s Court, sometimes called widows and orphans court, oversees matters involving the dead, such as estates, wills and trusts.\n\nJudge Thompson notified New York\u2019s top administrative judge in a letter last Friday that she would be retiring from her $210,000-a-year post as one of two judges overseeing the Brooklyn court as of March 1. As part of her agreement to step down, Judge Thompson pledged never to seek or accept a judicial position in the future and to halt any litigation she had initiated against the commission. Judge Thompson initially sought to delay the hearing next week by telling the commission she was \u201cnot medically fit to stand trial at this time.\u201d The commission said it had responded by authorizing a second complaint saying she was medically unfit to remain in office. \u201cThe conduct charged against Judge Thompson was egregious and, if established at trial, would have warranted her removal from office,\u201d the commission\u2019s administrator, Robert H. Tembeckjian, said in a statement. \u201cShe now claims a medical condition prevents her from performing judicial duties, which opens a different path in furtherance of the public interest for her immediate and permanent departure from the bench.\u201d Andrew S. Fisher, a lawyer for Judge Thompson, noted that the agreement between his client and the commission contained \u201cno finding of wrongdoing.\u201d He added that \u201cbut for the intervention of her medical problems, she would have vigorously defended herself.\u201d\n\nLucian Chalfen, a spokesman for courts, declined to comment. An acting surrogate court judge will continue to fill the vacated seat for the time being. Judge Thompson\u2019s decision to retire caps a tumultuous and truncated tenure in what was to be a 14-year term. Before being elected to the Surrogate\u2019s Court, she was a Brooklyn Civil Court judge from 2011 to 2018. The strife grew amid a dispute between her and Richard Buckheit, the court\u2019s public administrator, a city official responsible for handling the estates of the dead. Judge Thompson supervised Mr. Buckheit\u2019s office. The clash began in May 2019, when Judge Thompson, who is Black, told state court officials that, according to members of Mr. Buckheit\u2019s staff, he had created a hostile workplace for Black employees, The Daily News reported. She also claimed that Mr. Buckheit, who is white, hired only young white men for temporary jobs, the newspaper said. Mr. Buckheit denied the accusations and said that Judge Thompson had made them because she was homophobic and he was gay. He could not be reached for comment on Monday. As the clash unfolded, effectively halting the work of Mr. Buckheit\u2019s office, the state\u2019s top administrative judge directed the court system\u2019s inspector general to investigate complaints about Judge Thompson\u2019s comments in the presence of court employees.",

In the California imagination, the climate pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o has an almost mythological status as a harbinger of prolonged wet spells, while its counterpart, La Ni\u00f1a, is associated with drought. The past three years have been La Ni\u00f1a years. The continuing procession of storms this winter has drawn comparisons to the famed wet winter of 1997-98, when rain driven by El Ni\u00f1o drenched the Golden State. Californians are bracing for one of the season\u2019s most intense storms to date on Monday and Tuesday. But Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that El Ni\u00f1o hasn\u2019t taken over \u2014 yet.\n\n\u201cAs much as it walks and talks like El Ni\u00f1o, it ain\u2019t,\u201d he said of this winter\u2019s pattern. \u201cWe still have La Ni\u00f1a conditions, despite rumors of its demise.\u201d Even so, long-range forecasts suggest that California will transition into El Ni\u00f1o in the autumn. So how does this all work? How do we know if El Ni\u00f1o has taken over? Swain explained, simplifying a bit, that El Ni\u00f1o is essentially one side of a pendulum swing and La Ni\u00f1a is the other. During El Ni\u00f1o, trade winds are weaker, and warm water in the Pacific sloshes toward the western coasts of North America and South America. During La Ni\u00f1a, stronger trade winds push warm water in the other direction, toward the coast of Asia. Ocean temperatures affect the weather. A string of major storms in California has caused extreme flooding and damage across the state.\n\u2022 None Flood Risk: Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding could disproportionately affect Black residents\n\u2022 None Homeless Populations: Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms in a way few others did\n\u2022 None Drought: All the rain and snow All the rain and snow are undoubtedly good news for California\u2019s water supply , but they\u2019re unlikely to end the drought altogether\n\u2022 None Resilient Forests: Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees are adapted to a wide range of weather events This dynamic means that the effects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a vary in different parts of the world. In parts of the western Pacific, like Indonesia, for example, El Ni\u00f1o tends to produce drier conditions, rather than rain. In California, the relationship between wet years and El Ni\u00f1o depends on the strength of the pattern, and to some degree on chance. In other words, an El Ni\u00f1o year loads the dice in favor of a wet year, but does not guarantee one.\n\nThe latest heavy storms and flooding remind Jan Null, a meteorologist and former lead forecaster for the National Weather Service, of the winter of 2016-17, which was also a La Ni\u00f1a year. \u201cEvery El Ni\u00f1o is not wet, and every La Ni\u00f1a is not dry,\u201d Null said. Complex advanced predictive tools are showing that by next summer or fall, El Ni\u00f1o will probably be in place, and this time the pattern could be \u201ca pretty strong one,\u201d Swain said. That could bode well for California and the West\u2019s water outlook. \u201cAll of it is fascinating, and also humbling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re literally predicting the future.\u201d\n\u2022 None Extreme winds knocked out power in Sacramento over the weekend.\n\u2022 None What to do when there\u2019s a flash flood warning.

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "When Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during the N.F.L. \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game last week, it felt like the world stopped \u2014 both on the field, where emergency medical teams rushed into action and fellow players looked on in shock, and on televisions in millions of homes, where fans tried to make sense of what they had just witnessed in real time. Just moments earlier, the second-year Buffalo Bills safety had made a tackle on the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 Tee Higgins, causing his chest to collide violently with Higgins\u2019s helmet. Cardiologists have speculated that the impact may have triggered commotio cordis, a rare condition that can occur when the chest wall is hit during a vulnerable moment in the heartbeat cycle, which can knock the heart out of rhythm. Hamlin has made remarkable progress, but the condition can be fatal. The episode has focused international attention on the physical dangers of football, with many parents wondering anew if they should allow their children to play and some fans questioning whether it\u2019s ethical to support the sport at all. As a former college football player and neuroscientist who has advocated better protections for athletes for the last 20 years, I am encouraged by the outpouring of support for Hamlin, a talented player and a role model, and for his family.\n\nBut as alarming as his injury was, the terrifying incident carries a secondary risk: It is focusing attention on a single, dramatic outlier rather than the chronic medical conditions that pose by far the greatest danger to players. According to the National Commotio Cordis Registry, there are an estimated 15 to 20 cases per year nationwide, usually in sports like baseball or hockey when a fast-moving projectile connects with an unprotected chest. In football, where players wear lots of padding, an event like this is so rare at the N.F.L. level that it probably won\u2019t occur again in our lifetimes. Meanwhile, chronic heart disease and the long-term effects of traumatic brain injuries have robbed countless players of their health, their happiness and even their lives but do not receive the same medical or cultural attention because they happen away from the cameras. Hours before the Monday night game, I learned that the former N.F.L. offensive lineman Uche Nwaneri, who started 92 games at guard and center for the Jacksonville Jaguars, had died from a heart attack at the age of 38. Uche and I had been messaging on Twitter about our shared concerns about concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.). He had struggled to find his next passion after retiring but had recently gained a dedicated following on YouTube commenting on football and pop culture, calling himself the Observant Lineman. He is survived by his wife, Michele, and two young daughters. Young former N.F.L. players, mostly linemen, die from heart attacks or heart disease nearly every year. In addition to Uche, Shane Olivea died in March at age 40. Max Tuerk, age 26, died in 2020. Taylor Whitley, age 38, 2018. Jeremy Nunley, age 46, 2018. Nate Hobgood-Chittick, age 42, 2017. Rodrick Monroe, age 40, 2017. Ron Brace, age 29, 2016. Quentin Groves, 32, 2016. Damion Cook, 36, 2015. According to a 2019 study from Harvard University, N.F.L. players are 2.5 times as likely to have cardiovascular diseases listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death as Major League Baseball players. Scientists believe N.F.L. players are at greater risk of heart disease because of the weight they gain, even when it is mostly muscle. After players retire, it\u2019s extremely difficult for them to lose the football weight, partly because of chronic pain from injuries suffered while playing. (N.F.L. players ages 25 to 39 have about three times the rate of arthritis as the general public.) These men\u2019s untimely deaths were a tragedy to their loved ones, friends and former teammates, but the public was largely unaware.\n\nNeurological disorders are also uncomfortably common among former N.F.L. players. Uche had recently invited me on his podcast. We planned to discuss how football players should interpret data from the Boston University\u2019s C.T.E. Center study showing that around 90 percent of the more than 300 N.F.L. players they have studied since 2008 have had C.T.E., a neurodegenerative disease that is linked with the development of dementia and is caused in part by repeated traumatic brain injuries. While it is unlikely that those 300 N.F.L. players studied are representative of the total N.F.L. population, a separate analysis has suggested the minimum prevalence in N.F.L. players is 10 percent, more than 10 times what it is in the general population. Uche wanted his brain tested for C.T.E. after his death, and his family is following through on his request. Neurological damage from repeated head trauma may be behind the findings that N.F.L. players are three times as likely to die of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 3.5 times as likely to die of Parkinson\u2019s disease as Major League Baseball players. Death certificates tend to undercount dementia, but a survey published last year found that N.F.L. players in their 50s are 10 times as likely to be diagnosed with dementia as the general population. The risks N.F.L. players incur are not limited to their years on professional teams. C.T.E. risk is partly determined by the length of a player\u2019s career \u2014 the longer someone plays football, the more head impacts and traumatic brain injuries he is likely to suffer, the greater his risk. Therefore, this risk is also shared by college, high school and even youth players, all of whom are exposed to the risk, the vast majority without any financial upside \u2014 and in the case of children, without informed consent. I hope the football safety conversation that Damar Hamlin has inspired makes the game safer for young players who consider him a hero and want to follow in his footsteps. I also hope the public will focus on what we can influence, including how we manage risk factors for heart disease and when we introduce our children to tackle football. According to a study by the C.D.C., youth tackle football players average 389 head impacts a season. Perhaps we should Stop Hitting Kids in the Head and push for only flag football before high school. And perhaps those who profit off the sport should start to live up to their responsibility. The N.F.L. requires on average 30 medical professionals at each game. But while the risks do not end on the field, the medical care often does. Damar Hamlin deserves every ounce of our attention, support and respect after putting himself at risk for our entertainment. Let\u2019s keep talking about him, his family, his teammates, his city and the fans who have rallied behind him and all the positives that he has inspired and represents, including the preciousness of life \u2014 even the parts of it that are not captured on camera.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nCongressional gridlock brought on by far-right Republicans now seems more likely to lead to government shutdowns.\n\nThe House speaker elections last week turned a typically routine government procedure into a dramatic affair. They also exposed a major vulnerability in Congress: A small segment of lawmakers can stop the process of basic governance to obtain what it wants, with potentially big ramifications for the country. In the speaker fight, the immediate consequences were relatively small. A Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, is leading a majority-Republican House. More critical is how Republicans got there. McCarthy made concessions that will weaken his power, make it easier for lawmakers to oust him and give the right-wing rank-and-file greater input in legislation and in lawmakers\u2019 assignments to committees, where Congress does much of its work. The graver consequences will unfold months from now if the ultraconservatives who prolonged the speaker selection again withhold their votes until they have their way on looming spending bills. Congress must pass such legislation to keep the government open and avoid economic calamity. If deadlines for these bills come and go without a resolution, the government could be forced to shut down or, worse, default on its debt obligations, likely triggering a financial crisis. (More on that later.)\n\nThe right flank has already connected its opposition to McCarthy to such spending bills. In speeches during the four-day speaker battle, far-right Republicans cited a $1.7 trillion spending bill Congress passed last month to argue that establishment figures, including McCarthy, have failed to reduce government spending. Among the concessions that ultraconservatives drew from McCarthy was a promise that any increase on the country\u2019s debt limit, a congressionally set cap on the federal debt, will be paired with spending cuts. Some hard-liners have been clear that they would take drastic action again to have their way on spending. \u201cIs he willing to shut the government down rather than raise the debt ceiling? That\u2019s a nonnegotiable item,\u201d said Representative Ralph Norman, a Republican critic of McCarthy who ultimately voted for him.\n\nThe ultraconservatives have said that one of their main goals is to shrink the size of government. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop spending money that we don\u2019t have to fund the bureaucracy that is undermining the American people, we cannot win,\u201d said Representative Chip Roy, a Republican who voted against McCarthy in 11 ballots. One way to achieve this goal is by pushing Congress toward inaction. Consider some of the assurances the holdout Republicans received from McCarthy: more time to read and debate legislation, as well as to propose unlimited changes to it.\n\nIn theory, these changes might sound like common sense, since legislators should, ideally, be taking time to understand and finalize bills. But in practice, these kinds of allowances have slowed Congress\u2019s work, if not halted it altogether, by giving lawmakers more chances to stand in the way of any kind of legislation. This roadblock is especially likely in a closely divided Congress. Since House Republicans have a slim majority of 222 votes out of 435, they must rely on their right-wing faction to reach a majority in any vote (absent unlikely support from Democrats). Last week, that faction showed it will wield its leverage. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the ability \u2014 empowering us to stop the machine in this town from doing what it does,\u201d Roy said. If the ultraconservatives use these tactics in future legislative debates, Congress could miss deadlines to keep the government open and avoid a financial crisis. Among the looming fights is one over the debt limit. If the government ever reaches this limit, it can no longer borrow money to pay off its debts, potentially forcing a default. That could cause serious damage to the global financial system, which relies on U.S. Treasuries as a safe investment. The government is expected to hit the current debt limit in late summer. Republicans have already suggested that they will try to use negotiations over raising it to draw spending concessions from Senate Democrats and the Biden administration, a tactic that conservatives used during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. But Democrats have said that they will not negotiate over the debt limit this time. If both sides stick to their word, the government could be on track for the most treacherous debt-limit debate since 2011, my colleague Jim Tankersley reported. That year, Obama and a new Republican House majority nearly defaulted on the nation\u2019s debt before reaching a deal.\n\nSimilarly, the government will have to pass a spending bill in September to remain open. Republicans have, again, suggested that they will use their control of the House to reduce government spending. Democrats have said that they will push back. If both sides fall short of an agreement, the government will shut down, halting or slowing functions like the payment of military salaries, environmental or food inspections and the management of national parks. The battle over the speaker, then, is potentially a preview of what\u2019s to come: a Congress unable to perform even its basic duties because a small segment of lawmakers are willing to say no.\n\u2022 None History suggests that House Republicans\u2019 plans are likely to bring more gridlock and instability, Carl Hulse writes.\n\u2022 None House Republicans are preparing to investigate law enforcement and national security agencies.\n\nThe man behind the memoir One name you won\u2019t find on the cover of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d is J.R.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nBackers of former President Jair Bolsonaro ransacked government offices, denouncing what they falsely claim was a rigged election. Hundreds were arrested.\n\nThousands of supporters of Brazil\u2019s ousted former president, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed Brazil\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Sunday to protest what they falsely claim was a stolen election, the violent culmination of years of conspiracy theories advanced by Mr. Bolsonaro and his right-wing allies. In scenes reminiscent of the Jan. 6 storming of the United States Capitol, protesters in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil\u2019s capital, draped in the yellow and green of Brazil\u2019s flag surged into the seat of power, setting fires, repurposing barricades as weapons, knocking police officers from horseback and filming their crimes as they committed them. \u201cWe always said we would not give up,\u201d one protester declared as he filmed himself among hundreds of protesters pushing into the Capitol building. \u201cCongress is ours. We are in power.\u201d For months, protesters had been demanding that the military prevent the newly elected president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office on Jan. 1. Many on the right in Brazil have become convinced, despite the lack of evidence, that October\u2019s election was rigged.\n\nFor years, Mr. Bolsonaro had asserted, without any proof, that Brazil\u2019s election systems were rife with fraud and that the nation\u2019s elites were conspiring to remove him from power. Mr. Lula said Sunday that those false claims had fueled the attack on the plaza, known as Three Powers Square because of the presence of the three branches of government. Mr. Bolsonaro \u201ctriggered this,\u201d he said in an address to the nation. \u201cHe spurred attacks on the three powers whenever he could. This is also his responsibility.\u201d\n\nLate Sunday, Mr. Bolsonaro criticized the protests, saying on Twitter that peaceful demonstrations are part of democracy, but that \u201cdestruction and invasions of public buildings, like what occurred today,\u201d are not. But he also rejected Mr. Lula\u2019s accusations, saying they were \u201cwithout proof.\u201d At his inauguration, Mr. Lula said that uniting Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest country and one of the world\u2019s biggest democracies, would be a central goal of his administration. The invasion of the capital suggests that the nation\u2019s divisions are more profound than many had imagined, and it saddles the new president with a major challenge just one week into his administration.\n\nAfter Mr. Lula was inaugurated, protesters put out calls online for others to join them for a massive demonstration on Sunday. It quickly turned violent. Thousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Mass Attack: After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede.

Hundreds of protesters ascended a ramp to the roof of the congressional building in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, while a smaller group invaded the building from a lower level, according to witnesses and videos of the scene posted on social media. Other groups of protesters splintered off and broke into the presidential offices and the Supreme Court, which are in the same plaza. Protesters streamed into the government buildings, which were largely empty on a Sunday, breaking windows, overturning furniture and looting items inside, according to videos they posted online.\n\nThe crowds shouted that they were taking their country back, and that they would not be stopped. Outnumbered, the police fired what appeared to be rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear-gas canisters, including from two helicopters overhead. \u201cPolice are cowardly trying to expel the people from Congress, but there is no way, because even more are arriving,\u201d said one protester in a video filmed from inside Congress and showing hundreds of protesters on multiple floors. \u201cNo one is taking our country, damn it.\u201d Mr. Lula, who was not in Bras\u00edlia during the invasion, issued an emergency decree until Jan. 31 that allows the federal government to take \u201cany measures necessary\u201d to restore order in the capital. \u201cThere is no precedent for what these people have done, and for that, these people must be punished,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro appeared to be in Florida. He flew to Orlando in the final days of his presidency, in hopes that his absence from the country would help cool off investigations into his activity as president, according to a friend of the president\u2019s who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. He planned to stay in Florida for one to three months, this person said. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information?

Mr. Bolsonaro has never unequivocally conceded defeat in the election, leaving it to his aides to handle the transition of power and skipping the inauguration, where he was supposed to pass the presidential sash to Mr. Lula, an important symbol of the transition of power for a country that lived under a 21-year military dictatorship until 1985. After the election, he said he supported peaceful protests inspired by \u201cfeelings of injustice in the electoral process.\u201d But before departing for Florida, Mr. Bolsonaro suggested to his supporters that they move on. \u201cWe live in a democracy or we don\u2019t,\u201d he said in a recorded statement. \u201cNo one wants an adventure.\u201d The next day, thousands of his supporters remained camped outside the Army headquarters in Bras\u00edlia, with many convinced that the military and Mr. Bolsonaro were about to execute a secret plan to prevent Mr. Lula\u2019s inauguration.\n\nOne of Mr. Lula\u2019s central challenges as president will be to unify the nation after a bitter election in which some of his supporters framed Mr. Bolsonaro as genocidal and cannibalistic, while Mr. Bolsonaro repeatedly called Mr. Lula a criminal. (Mr. Lula served 19 months in prison on corruption charges that were later thrown out.)

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nUkraine is shifting its strategy to defend the city.\n\nGoing toe to toe in Bakhmut It\u2019s one of the longest running battles in more than 10 months of war \u2014 one that has come to resemble a heavyweight title bout. Throughout most of the war, Ukraine has succeeded by avoiding direct confrontations, relying instead on nimble maneuvers, deception and Western-provided long-range weapons.\n\nAndrew Kramer, The Times\u2019s Kyiv bureau chief, and Nicole Tung, a photographer, traveled to Bakhmut to report on the lethal urban combat raging there. In the ruined city in the eastern Donetsk region, Andrew described scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink. \u201cIt looks like apocalypse,\u201d a Ukrainian soldier said. Earlier in the war, Ukraine\u2019s leadership was not convinced that pitched battles with high casualties were a winning strategy. But new research showed that attritional fighting in the east over the summer had weakened the Russian Army and had contributed to two successful offensives in the following months, in the Kharkiv region in the north and Kherson in the south.\n\nRussia has been trying to seize control of Bakhmut since the summer. The town\u2019s strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months. In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance.\n\nThe battle has been fought in two phases. For the first 100 days or so, the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on, a private military company, the Wagner Group, took on a major role. The Wagner Group has assaulted the city using brigades made up of convicts it has recruited from Russian prisons. Ukrainian soldiers call them human wave assaults. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner Group who is close to President Vladimir Putin, is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to bolster his political standing back in Russia. Russian troops, along with fighters from the Wagner Group, are battling to encircle the city by gaining control of nearby towns and villages, including Soledar, which lies along the front line to the northeast. Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, visited troops defending Bakhmut and Soledar yesterday. He said that fighters from the Wagner Group had attempted to storm Soledar from several directions but were repelled. In his nightly address on Sunday, President Volodmyr Zelensky described fighting in the area around Bakhmut as \u201cone of the bloodiest places on the front line\u201d and said additional units would be sent to reinforce Ukrainian positions.\n\nA senior Ukrainian military official with detailed knowledge of the fight around Soledar said that Wagner forces had experienced heavy casualties and that Russia\u2019s military command had begun to send more regular troops to the region to fill in the gaps. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military assessments, said that the Wagner soldiers had fought more recklessly than those of the regular Russian military, attacking head-on instead of maneuvering tactically. About 7,000 people remain of the city\u2019s prewar population of about 100,000, according to one community organizer. Most of those remaining are on the less heavily damaged western bank of the small river that divides Bakhmut, the Bakhmutovka. The eastern neighborhoods are panoramas of collapsed and burned houses.

            "content": "\u201cWomen were built to endure the rules men make,\u201d Parini Shroff writes in her debut novel, \u201cThe Bandit Queens,\u201d which covers a litany of grim realities in rural India: poverty, hunger, alcoholism, domestic violence, sexual assault and a caste system, to name a few. This might sound depressing, but Shroff manages to spin all of the above into a radically feel-good story about the murder of no-good husbands by a cast of unsinkable women.\n\nThe leader of the pack is Geeta, whose abusive husband, Ramesh, abandoned her five years earlier without so much as a goodbye. Now the whole village thinks she murdered him; neighbors give her \u201cthe wide berth bestowed to any social pariah.\u201d But, for the most part, the isolation that comes with the reputation of \u201cself-made widow\u201d suits Geeta \u2014 or at least she\u2019s convinced herself that it does.\n\nIntent on funding a jewelry-making business that will cement her independence, Geeta joins a microloan group with several village women. She\u2019s proud to focus on her craft \u2014 as opposed to homemaking or social jockeying \u2014 and insists on eating \u201cno one\u2019s salt but her own.\u201d In fact, she\u2019s almost saved enough money for a refrigerator, which will \u201cchange everything, including how others saw her.\u201d\n\nTo make sense of her lot in life, Geeta has adopted as her guiding light Phoolan Devi, a young woman who became known throughout India as the \u201cBandit Queen\u201d after she killed 22 men \u2014 her tormentors and rapists \u2014 in a single day. Part historical figure, part legend, Phoolan completed her jail sentence and became an activist and member of Parliament before being assassinated at age 37. To Geeta, she is an inspiring example of a woman who managed to wrest control of her life: \u201cThe Bandit Queen didn\u2019t wait for help, she was help.\u201d",

Experts provide tips on how to handle it.\n\nKate Mroz was training for the 2019 Chicago Marathon when her leg gave out during a run along the Charles River in Cambridge, Mass. The 33-year-old theology professor called an Uber to take her home. Later, she learned she\u2019d sustained a hairline fracture on her thigh bone. With two weeks until race day, her marathon plans were thwarted; even jogging caused unbearable pain. \u201cI remember missing the bus to work one day because I could not run across the street to catch it,\u201d said Mrs. Mroz, who also works as a run coach. \u201cThinking that, just weeks before, I was knocking out 15- to 20-mile runs was devastating.\u201d Ms. Mroz was cleared to run after a 14 week hiatus, but the time away challenged her mental health. \u201cI fell into a deep depression that often went unnoticed \u2014 with the exception of my husband, who had to live with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was still doing well at my job and had recently published a paper. Inside, however, I was hurting.\u201d Sports injuries are fairly common: About 8.6 million sports and recreation-related injuries occur in the United States each year. While most athletes know they\u2019re risking breaks, tears, sprains and occasional bruises, being sidelined can also bring a host of emotional challenges: For some it\u2019s depression and anxiety; for others it\u2019s a deep sense of loss.\n\nLucas Bielsa Campo, for example, is an outdoor enthusiast \u2014 a trail runner, mountain biker and hiker \u2014 who spent all of his time getting lost in nature until he was struck with debilitating back pain. After a misdiagnosis and 11 months of physical therapy, Mr. Campo, 33, who lives in the Spanish Pyrenees, remains in limbo waiting for a diagnosis. \u201cThe hardest part has been my mental health and my self-esteem. It\u2019s grief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard for me to accept that I\u2019m injured.\u201d Though research is limited, there is evidence that sidelined athletes experience a range of responses often associated with grief, like sadness, anger, confusion, decreased self-esteem and denial \u2014 as well as physical symptoms like fatigue, insomnia and loss of appetite. \u201cGrief is a complex response,\u201d said Natalia Skritskaya, a research scientist at the Columbia University Center for Prolonged Grief. \u201cIt\u2019s the absence of something that was once rewarding.\u201d Along with bringing physical pain, sports injuries can leave exercise-shaped holes in your life once filled by bike paths, race medals and group runs. This sudden shift can cause a \u201crestructuring of identity,\u201d said Matthew Sacco, a clinical health and sports psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic. In the aftermath of an injury, you may be writing a new script for your life \u2014 one that no longer includes your favorite hobby.\n\nYou might also feel the absence of uplifting hormones. \u201cThere are a lot of endorphins and chemical changes that happen in our body when we exercise,\u201d said Jared Vagy, a clinical assistant professor of physical therapy at the University of Southern California. \u201cIf that\u2019s the only method that some people have to release those chemicals, then you\u2019ve just lost a large part of what makes you complete as a human or satisfied.\u201d And recovery itself comes with additional mental hurdles. Damilola Gbolahan, a sports physiotherapist who works with injured soccer players, said that people often try to progress faster by overdoing physical therapy. And pushing too hard can have detrimental effects like \u201cfrustration, more stress and depression, which can also slow down recovery,\u201d she said. Despite the turbulent feelings that surface post-injury, our minds are likely working to regain a sense of order and stability, Dr. Skritskaya said. Here are a few ways to find agency and a little hope while you\u2019re on the mend: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that you\u2019re an athlete, and now your recovery is part of your sport,\u201d said Carrie Jackson co-founder of The Injured Athletes Club, an online community for people who are currently sidelined from their favorite sports. If you thrived on following a training plan, or enjoyed logging your gains in a calendar or a journal, keep that practice while you\u2019re recovering. That way, you have a record of all the work you\u2019ve been doing \u2014 and you\u2019re treating rehabilitation as part of being an athlete. Ms. Jackson also recommended listing recovery actions you need to stop, start and continue while you heal. For example, you may need to stop going on long walks, start a creative outlet that will keep you occupied and continue your physical therapy exercises. This is a useful way to empower yourself when you feel discouraged by your injury. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to just focus on all the things you can\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tool for refocusing on what\u2019s actually in your control.\u201d Being with others who\u2019ve faced similar experiences is a helpful way to navigate any form of grief. \u201cCommunity is a big part of recovery. Even if we define a sport like running as a very individual sport, there is a very defined running culture,\u201d Dr. Sacco said. \u201cThere\u2019s a loss of community that comes from just not being in the same place at the same time for the same reasons.\u201d\n\nMr. Campo found fellowship in The Injured Athletes Club\u2019s Facebook group where sports lovers connect over the feelings associated with their injuries and celebrate recovery steps, large and small. And Ms. Mroz, who completed an Ironman in 2022, founded a group called Athletes Against Diet Culture to promote athleticism at all sizes and raise awareness about injuries caused by eating and exercise disorders. \u201cThe group is still going strong today,\u201d she said. Being open to new experiences is a significant advantage for those who sustain injuries, Dr. Sacco explained. The ability to rethink your life can ultimately lead to a greater sense of satisfaction. Colleen Quigley, an Olympic steeplechase runner, experienced several foot injuries that interrupted her training cycles, putting her livelihood at risk. During her most recent rehabilitation, she was limited to cross-training sports like swimming and biking. Rather than seeing her recovery as a burden, she decided to give those activities her all and found they made her a more well-rounded athlete. \u201cI was also just having so much fun,\u201d she said. Ms. Quigley added triathlons to her competition schedule and hopes to compete in them during future Olympic Games. If your injury requires retiring for good \u2014 or at least for the foreseeable future \u2014 quickly bouncing back may not be possible. But there are other ways you can progress, Ms. Jackson said. \u201cYou might not know which direction you are going to bounce, but you will bounce,\u201d she added. She recommended exploring what\u2019s important to you and why, so you can replicate that feeling through another outlet. For Mr. Campo, \u201cbouncing\u201d involves listening to audiobooks and podcasts, watching movies and surrounding himself with people who love him. He also dresses much more colorfully and practices Nordic walking, a lower-impact style of walking that involves trekking poles. \u201cIt has been the hardest year of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe that it has been a very useful year to see that I can be happy even if I\u2019m injured.\u201d",

His decades chafing under the eye of the British press. His marriage to Meghan Markle and his rift with the royal family. His drug use, his years in the Army, even his decision to keep his beard: In the first interviews about his memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d Prince Harry appeared confident defending his perspective, even under tough questioning. After 38 years of having his story told by other people, \u201cit felt like a good time to tell it myself,\u201d Harry said of the book, which Random House will publish on Tuesday. The interviews, which aired on the British network ITV and on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d weren\u2019t the first time Harry has spoken publicly about the relentless glare of scrutiny on his family and its toll, but they were the first time he did so without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, by his side. The two covered similar ground, with a few exceptions.\n\nHarry described what happened in September after the palace announced that his grandmother, the queen, was under medical supervision at Balmoral Castle, in Scotland. He was in London, but wasn\u2019t invited to join family members who flew there together. He traveled to Balmoral by himself; when he arrived, his aunt asked if he wanted to see his grandmother, who had died. \u201cI went upstairs,\u201d he said, \u201cand just spent some time with her alone.\u201d Cooper asked Harry about the treatments he tried after seeing a therapist for the first time seven years ago, including the use of psychedelics. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor. Its publication seems likely to dash any near-term prospects of The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor. Its publication seems likely to dash any near-term prospects of a reconciliation between Harry and his family\n\u2022 None The State of Kate: Prince Harry\u2019s revelations about Catherine, Princess of Wales, portray her as she tries to exert some kind of bodily control in the face of transgressions. That behavior is consistent with the Prince Harry\u2019s revelations about Catherine, Princess of Wales, portray her as she tries to exert some kind of bodily control in the face of transgressions.

Here\u2019s a look at Dysfunction and disorder are hardly restricted to the House of Windsor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies \u201cI would never recommend people to do this recreationally,\u201d Harry said. But he said, \u201cBut doing it with the right people if you are suffering from a huge amount of loss, grief or trauma, then these things have a way of working as a medicine.\u201d He added: \u201cFor me, they cleared the windscreen, the windshield, the misery of loss.\u201d The interviewer for the 90-minute ITV interview was Tom Bradby, who, in 2019, famously asked Meghan a straightforward question: Are you OK? She was not. The pained look on the Duchess\u2019s face foreshadowed a drumbeat of revelations about royal life that has sounded steadily over the past three years, including an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nHarry quickly shut down the topic of how and where he lost his virginity, which he said only merits four lines in the book. Bradby suggested that Harry\u2019s use of cocaine would be of interest to the public, but Harry shifted the focus back to his treatment at the hands of the press. \u201cMy life itself has been put through a blender,\u201d he said. The media was a recurring theme throughout the interview; every time a new subject came up, Harry found a way to return to his favorite punching bag. One unexpected disclosure had to do with Harry\u2019s beard, which is now a part of his identity. According to protocol, the prince needed his grandmother\u2019s approval to keep the facial hair for his wedding. Queen Elizabeth was amenable, but his brother William was not; he ordered Harry to shave. Harry\u2019s response: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Meghan is going to recognize me.\u201d When Bradby asked Harry about William\u2019s feelings toward Meghan, Harry said, \u201cHe never tried to dissuade me from marrying Meghan,\u201d but \u201che said it was going to be very hard.\u201d The behavior of his brother and sister-in-law toward Meghan, Harry said, left him feeling like \u201cstereotyping was causing a bit of a barrier to them really sort of, you know, introducing or welcoming her in.\u201d\n\nBradby said, \u201cYou talk about accountability. In the Oprah interview you accused members of your family of racism.\u201d What the royal family is guilty of, Harry said, was institutional bias. Later, he illustrated the point by describing what happened when Susan Hussey \u2014 one of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s longtime ladies-in-waiting \u2014 buttonholed a guest at a palace reception, Ngozi Fulani, and quizzed her about where she was from, not accepting that she was British. Afterward, Hussey met with Fulani in Buckingham Palace and offered her apologies. Harry said that Hussey \u201cnever meant any harm at all, but the response from the British press, and from people online because of the stories that they wrote, was horrendous.\u201d In the most poignant moments of the discussion, Harry described his decision, years after his mother died, to look at pictures taken after her car crash in Paris. In the photographs, he could see reflections of paparazzi in the windows of the car: \u201cNot one of them was checking on her, offering her help, comforting her. They were just shooting, shooting, shooting.\u201d Bradby pressed Harry on the question of how he squares his desire for privacy with his public retellings of his story. Harry said that he feels his recent Netflix documentary series and the book are \u201cnecessary and essential.\u201d He was sorry that \u201cme owning my story\u201d was upsetting to some, he said. But he still believed a reconciliation with the House of Windsor was possible, he said, adding, \u201cPeace can happen when there\u2019s truth.\u201d",

            "section": "Theater",
            "content": "Binder, who is 55, has drawn some buzzy work to BAM, which primarily presents shows developed by other companies.\n\nLast year\u2019s pandemic-delayed production of \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d which starred James McAvoy and transferred from London, was both a critical and a popular success, becoming the best-selling show in the history of the BAM Harvey Theater. And this month, BAM was the only institution with two shows on The New York Times\u2019s list of things critics are looking forward to this year: the theater critic Jesse Green wrote about anticipating a production of \u201cThe Sign in Sidney Brustein\u2019s Window,\u201d with Oscar Isaac and Rachel Brosnahan in the starring roles, and the dance critic Gia Kourlas wrote hopefully about BAM\u2019s U.S. premiere of Pina Bausch\u2019s \u201c\u00c1gua,\u201d a piece created two decades ago in Brazil.\n\nBinder arrived at BAM saying he wanted to bring in new artists \u2014 his first Next Wave festival there, in 2019, featured only artists who had not previously performed there. Over the course of his tenure, Binder said he will have presented more than 50 debuts of artistic companies as well as solo performers.\n\nTicket sales during his time have generally exceeded projections; BAM says it is attracting new audiences, and there have been multiple programming highlights: Simon Stone\u2019s \u201cMedea\u201d adaptation, produced by BAM, starring Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale; a new spring music series, curated last year by Hanif Abdurraqib and this year by Solange; and an annual artist residency program.\n\n\u201cThrough the pandemic and through the leadership changes, I feel that the team and I at BAM have stayed focused on putting fantastic work on our stages, and when we couldn\u2019t do it on our stages, we did it outdoors or site-specific or virtually. And the work we\u2019ve done has been really successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always tried to mix it up: We had the National Theater of Korea\u2019s opera of \u2018Trojan Women,\u2019 and \u2018Kiki and Herb Sleigh\u2019; we had the Lithuanian opera \u2018Sun & Sea,\u2019 which won the Golden Lion at Venice; and we also hosted the world premiere of Madonna\u2019s \u2018Madame X\u2019 tour.\u201d\n\nIn the commercial arena, Binder is best known as the lead producer of \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch,\u201d which won the Tony Award for best musical revival in 2014. Binder said that he would soon announce that \u201cHedwig\u201d was \u201cfinally coming to the West End in a big way.\u201d\n\nBeyond \u201cHedwig,\u201d Binder is among a handful of commercial producers who have continued to focus on the production of plays, which tend to be riskier than musicals. He says he plans to resume work on his longtime effort to bring the German director Thomas Ostermeier\u2019s production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People\u201d to Broadway. (Last fall, Binder brought Ostermeier\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d to BAM; that production was in German, but \u201cAn Enemy of the People\u201d would be presented in English.)",

He has played the ghost with the most on Broadway for parts of the past four years.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA concussion nearly derailed the actor\u2019s fan-favorite turn as the madcap, black-and-white striped ghoul. But he recovered in time for the closing show.\n\nAs Alex Brightman disappeared through the doorway to the Netherworld one last time at the Marquis Theater on Sunday night, his black-and-white-striped Beetlejuice suit enveloped by a cloud of smoke, he uttered a few special parting words: \u201cI\u2019m very aware that it really could be the last time I am on Broadway,\u201d said Brightman, 35, who for parts of the past four years has played the ghostly guide to the other side in \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d the Broadway musical based on the 1988 Tim Burton film about a face-off between a goth girl and a devious demon. \u201cSo it\u2019s a humbling experience to be up there and to be able to share and be vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHis farewell wasn\u2019t quite the one he had anticipated. At a Christmas Eve performance, Brightman slammed into the show\u2019s giant sandworm backstage at a full sprint \u2014 when a door hadn\u2019t opened, Brightman tried an ill-fated alternate route \u2014 leaving him with a concussion. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize what had happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured I just banged my head.\u201d Symptoms abruptly surfaced two days later, and after spending the next week nauseous, achy and painfully sensitive to light, he thought he\u2019d played his final performance \u2014 maybe ever. (Three of the show\u2019s standby and understudy Beetlejuices, Andrew Kober, Elliott Mattox and Will Blum, filled in while Brightman was out.)\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to recover,\u201d said Brightman, who was funny and lively in the eighth-floor cocktail lounge at the Marriott Marquis hotel before getting into costume for Sunday evening\u2019s performance. \u201cIt felt like one long 10- or 11-day sickness in one day.\u201d But things improved about a week ago, he said, and after doing a four-hour rehearsal on Thursday, he got the all-clear to return for the show\u2019s final three evening performances. The 1,602 audience members at the sold-out performance on Sunday night, many of whom sported black-and-white striped suits and green wigs, showered Brightman with appreciation. (Everyone in attendance received a special Playbill with a silver sticker on the cover that read \u201cIt\u2019s the Final Showtime.\u201d) It started with his first entrance, when he received two minutes of applause and a standing ovation.\n\nThough \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theater in April 2019 to mixed reviews (the New York Times critic Ben Brantley called it \u201cabsolutely exhausting\u201d), it became a fan favorite \u2014 dozens of them would turn up as Lydia, the Maitlands and, of course, Beetlejuice to compete in the musical\u2019s preshow costume contests. Still, the show was handed a closing notice in December of that year when what the Shubert Organization saw as a potentially lucrative production of \u201cThe Music Man\u201d needed its real estate. Then the pandemic happened, and the production shuttered in March 2020. The surging sales before the closure led producers to reopen the show last year at the Marquis Theater in April. But attendance dipped again over the summer, and producers announced in October that the show would close in January after 679 performances. (A national touring production began in December, and there are also coming international versions in Brazil and Japan.)\n\nBrightman and Elizabeth Teeter, who plays Lydia, paid tribute to the show\u2019s fans, known as \u201cNetherlings,\u201d on Sunday night, holding up signs at the curtain call that read \u201cHey guys\u201d and \u201cLove you guys!\u201d \u201cThis is a show about death that\u2019s actually really a celebration of life,\u201d the show\u2019s director, Alex Timbers, said from the stage after a purple-and-green confetti storm. \u201cAnd you all have given us life.\u201d Before the show and directly afterward in his dressing room \u2014 sweaty and smiling in a white V-neck stained with green and red blotches as his team helped him remove his makeup for the final time \u2014 Brightman reflected on parting ways with the ghost with the most, the show\u2019s fervent fan following and what\u2019s next for him (other than, of course, sleeping).\n\nYou first read the part in 2017. How are you feeling after tonight\u2019s performance? Exhausted. It was very cathartic. I\u2019m thrilled I got to close it after six years. Do you have any lingering effects from the concussion? I still have headaches, but they\u2019re not pounding. I take Aleve. And my doctor said I will probably be prone to more headaches throughout the rest of my life because of it, but nothing too crazy. How important was it to you to make it back for the closing night? I\u2019m not necessarily one of those people that believes in making that miraculous appearance at that last performance because he has to. I value my health, and I want to do more things after this. So running the risk of passing out onstage or reinjuring myself if I wasn\u2019t ready was not in the cards. What has it been like starring in a show with such a devoted fan base? It never, ever gets old. The \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d fans are the warmest fans that I\u2019ve ever encountered in the six Broadway shows I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a lot of me in there, so for 1,500 people to accept my character in the show and my style of absurdity and comedy and improv is extremely cathartic and emotional. What is it like to spend so long with the same character? The last thing I want to do is be bored with anything I do, and anything this long has that danger, but this part allows me to discover new things not every night, but every minute. I have the ability to be a bit topical, a bit loose \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m on a track. That\u2019s made it easy to do for six years.\n\nWhat did your first attempts at the Beetlejuice voice sound like? At my first audition, I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do a Michael Keaton impression, so let me just try something.\u201d And it went fine, but I paid for it for two days \u2014 my voice was on fire. How do you do it now for eight shows a week without damaging your vocal cords? It\u2019s called ventricular fold phonation, and it means you vibrate the cartilage in your throat alongside your vocal cords. I was able to figure out through trial and error that it\u2019s the same muscles I use to clear my throat. I could do this interview better \u2014 and more healthfully \u2014[switches to Beetlejuice voice] in this voice than just talking to you with [reverts to normal voice] this voice, because right now I\u2019m using my vocal cords, and vocal cords get tired. Cartilage doesn\u2019t get tired \u2014 there\u2019s no nerves, it\u2019s not a muscle.\n\nI sold a cartoon series to Warner Bros., \u201cCleaners,\u201d which is a raunchy, slightly musical comedy about a crew from Boston that does biohazard cleanups \u2014 crime scenes, meth labs, hoarders. And I wrote a play called \u201cEverything Is Fine,\u201d about the one-year aftermath of a mall shooting from the perspective of the family of the perpetrator, who is no longer with us. Cynthia Nixon directed a number of the readings, and we\u2019re hoping to continue getting that somewhere in New York. And I\u2019m working on a musical with Universal Theatrical with my writing partner, which is an adaptation of the film \u201cIt\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story,\u201d about a kid who checks himself into a psychiatric ward. I\u2019ve been onstage for 15 years now, kind of consistently, and I\u2019m a little Broadway-ed and musical-ed out, which I know is a very privileged thing to say. But what comes with doing this is scrutiny. People look at you and judge you every night. I want to do my own thing for a second \u2014 to just let my work speak for itself and not have to defend it with a musical number. Would you ever want to return to \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d? What I know is that I have the right of first refusal for a London production, were it to happen. There are no designs for it to happen just yet that I know of, but I would consider it.\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick round of confirm or deny. You have done the voice in a public setting that is not the theater. Confirm. A few months ago, I went into Starbucks and said [in his Beetlejuice voice] \u201cCan I just have one grande Pike Place with a little bit of half and half and just one Splenda?\u201d They said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d And I said [in Beetlejuice voice], \u201cB.J.\u201d And then they said, \u201cCoffee for B.J.?\u201d And I said [in Beetlejuice voice], \u201cThanks so much.\u201d And I left. It\u2019s New York. I was the least weird thing to walk into that Starbucks that day. You get nervous when you know someone famous will be at the show. Deny. The only person who would make me nervous would be Mel Brooks, because I revere him to a point that is probably pretty unhealthy. If you had to choose between marrying Beetlejuice or having to wear a single pair of used workout clothes for the rest of your life, you would \u2014 Marry Beetlejuice, if only for the fact that I know how much I sweat.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRobert A. Hadden\u2019s deal in 2016 with state prosecutors required no prison time and angered victims. On Monday, federal authorities took him to trial on similar charges.\n\nMore than a decade ago, a woman traveled from Upper Saddle River, N.J., to Manhattan, crossing the Hudson River to see her gynecologist, Robert A. Hadden. After a routine checkup with a nurse in the room, Mr. Hadden left. Moments later, he returned alone, she testified on Monday, and sexually assaulted her. \u201cI was flabbergasted,\u201d testified the woman, who was identified by the pseudonym Kate Evans in court. \u201cI was amazed. I was petrified.\u201d She was not the only woman enticed by Mr. Hadden to cross state lines so he could abuse her, a prosecutor said during an opening statement in Mr. Hadden\u2019s trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan. In all, Mr. Hadden is accused of persuading four patients to travel from Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Jersey to New York State for what they believed would be routine examinations. In 2016, Mr. Hadden pleaded guilty in a separate case in state court after being accused of sexual abuse by 19 patients, but was spared prison time in a deal that brought scrutiny for former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Mr. Hadden has not worked as a doctor since 2012, when he was an obstetrician-gynecologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and also on staff at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Hadden walked into Judge Richard Berman\u2019s courtroom wearing a black knit hat, light blue button-down shirt, a black suit and a blue medical mask. He sat at the defense table with his brows furrowed above his wire-rimmed glasses as he listened to opening statements from prosecutors and his defense attorneys, as well as testimony from the witness testifying as Ms. Evans, who said she was his patient for more than a decade. Over the years, Mr. Hadden had offered the woman unsolicited advice on sex positions and commented on her body while conducting a breast exam. But, in the last two examinations, Mr. Hadden\u2019s behavior escalated, according to her testimony. She stopped going to him in 2011, she said. Mr. Hadden abused women between about 1993 and 2012, often increasing the level of his transgressions over time, according to court documents.\n\nFederal authorities had charged Mr. Hadden with enticing eight former patients, including a minor he is said to have delivered. Six days before opening arguments on Monday, prosecutors told the judge that their case would involve only four victims, none of them minors. In opening statements, a prosecutor, Paul Monteleoni, said Mr. Hadden \u201cabused his position of power\u201d with patients who trusted him, motivated by his own sexual desires. Over the years, the women have tried to put the abuse out of their minds, Mr. Monteleoni said. One, after being assaulted by Mr. Hadden, closed herself in a bathroom at the medical office and called her boyfriend and a friend, he said. Once her boyfriend arrived, they called the police. A court filing by prosecutors included copies of hurried text messages a patient sent in 2012 to a friend and the woman who had referred her to Mr. Hadden, after an examination in which she said he abused her. \u201cI\u2019m shaking And freaked out,\u201d she wrote in one message. In another she wrote: \u201cI\u2019m in the bathroom don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Hadden built relationships of trust and rapport, softening up his victims by asking questions and then providing unsolicited advice and commentary about their bodies and sex lives. He persuaded victims to travel to see him from outside New York by offering free birth control and directing patients to schedule follow-up visits, law enforcement officials said in court documents. Mr. Monteleoni said Mr. Hadden had admitted that his conduct \u201cwasn\u2019t a mistake\u201d by pleading guilty in 2016.\n\nDeirdre von Dornum, a federal public defender, argued in her opening statement that the case in federal court wasn\u2019t about whether Mr. Hadden had sexually assaulted patients in the past. She said that question was settled seven years ago. \u201cRobert Hadden did what we hope people do when they break the law,\u201d she said. \u201cHe pleaded guilty.\u201d Instead, she said, Mr. Hadden was on trial to determine whether he knowingly enticed or induced his patients to cross state lines for appointments. He should be acquitted of those \u201cvery specific, very technical\u201d federal charges, she said, adding that \u201cno one forced them to make continuing appointments.\u201d Patients chose the time, date and location of their appointments and scheduled them with a secretary, not directly with Mr. Hadden, Ms. von Dornum said. \u201cThere was no premeditation for this abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cCancel him, condemn him,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not convict him of a crime he did not commit.\u201d Some former patients have said they were unhappy with the outcome of the state case, in which Mr. Hadden was charged with abusing six women. In return for pleading guilty to two charges, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office agreed that Mr. Hadden could avoid prison and receive the lowest possible sex offender status. Officials with the district attorney\u2019s office have defended the decision, saying that Mr. Hadden had surrendered his medical license as a result of the agreement and that aspects of evidence in the case would have allowed the defense to attack the credibility of accusers. A lawyer for Mr. Hadden had said that she would cite the fact that certain patients were suing him in civil court to suggest that they had a financial interest in the outcome of the criminal case.",

            "section": "New York",
            "content": "The victims of the Twin Parks fire on Jan. 9, 2022, died from smoke inhalation because of faulty doors, according to the city\u2019s medical examiner.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nOn the anniversary of the Twin Parks fire that killed 17 people, a federal agency will move to use new powers to investigate fire safety nationally.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the Twin Parks fire in the Bronx that killed 17 people, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will announce a new national plan to combat \u201cAmerica\u2019s fire problem\u201d using investigatory muscle granted by federal legislation that President Biden signed last month. The legislation will give the United States Fire Administration the power to identify the causes of fires like the one at the Twin Parks North West housing complex in the Bronx, New York City\u2019s deadliest inferno in decades. It also allows the agency, which is part of FEMA, to identify other buildings with similar problems and to issue recommendations. An investigation by The New York Times found that the fire safety system at Twin Parks suffered a catastrophic failure and that the deaths were preventable. The blaze was sparked by an electric space heater that ignited a mattress, but the victims died of smoke inhalation, not the fire itself. Investigators believe that deadly smoke was able to spread to the upper floors of the 19-story building because of faulty self-closing doors. Twin Parks, an affordable housing building that was constructed in 1972, had been the heart of a Gambian immigrant community in the Bronx, and most of the people who died in the fire were African immigrants or their children. Like many older residential buildings in the city, Twin Parks had no sprinkler protection. More than a million American households live in public housing units, and many lack lifesaving measures like sprinklers or hard-wired smoke detectors.\n\nLori Moore-Merrell, head of the U.S. Fire Administration, said in an interview that the new investigative authority will allow her agency to ask, \u201cHow many other buildings in New York have those same kinds of points of failure?\u201d Residents gathered Monday afternoon outside Twin Parks to commemorate the first anniversary of the deadly fire and to unveil a street sign honoring the building\u2019s first Gambian resident, Abdoulie Touray. Current and former residents said they remain scarred by that day.\n\n\u201cWe are still here, surviving,\u201d said Saidatu Hammed, 33, as she looked up at the 12th-floor window of her old apartment and remembered friends and neighbors who had died. What to Know About Affordable Housing in New York A worsening crisis. New York City is in a dire housing crunch, exacerbated by the pandemic, that has made living in the city more expensive and increasingly out of reach for many people. Here is what to know: A longstanding shortage. While the city always seems to be building and expanding, experts say it is not fast enough to keep up with demand. Zoning restrictions, the cost of building and the ability by politicians to come up with a solution are among the barriers to increasing the supply of housing. Rising costs. The city regulates the rents of many apartments, but more than one-third of renters in the city are still severely rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent, according to city data. Property owners say higher rents are necessary for them to deal with the growing burden of taxes and rising expenses for property maintenance. Public housing. Thousands of people are on waitlists for public housing in buildings overseen by the New York City Housing Authority. But the city\u2019s public housing system, the largest in the nation, has become an emblem of the deterioration of America\u2019s aging public housing stock and is desperately in need of a financial rescue. In search of solutions. Mayor Eric Adams has presented a plan to address New York City\u2019s housing crisis that includes expanding affordable housing through incentives for developers and preserving existing below-market units. But the mayor\u2019s critics say the budget still falls short of what is needed. In an earlier interview, Nikki Campbell, 46, a survivor of the fire, lauded the new federal plan. \u201cMoving forward, we have to make sure things are done properly \u2014 these are people\u2019s lives,\u201d Ms. Campbell, a city Parks Department employee who lived with her four children on the building\u2019s third floor, said in an interview. None of Ms. Campbell\u2019s children were hurt, but three of them jumped out the window to safety. The family then spent nine months living in two hotel rooms before finding an apartment in September. \u201cYou assume things are being taken care of, like fire doors and fire-resistant paint, but they really got to hold these landlords accountable,\u201d she said. At the Monday gathering, several speakers focused on how inequality, including the lack of safe, affordable housing in lower-income neighborhoods like the South Bronx, contributed to the tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s always in our neighborhood,\u201d said Haji Dukuray, whose niece died in the fire along with her husband and their three children. \u201cNothing against the Upper East Side, but we don\u2019t hear about that there.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Moore-Merrell will travel to New York where, along with Laura Kavanagh, the New York City fire commissioner, she will honor those who died. The next day, Ms. Moore-Merrell will visit the scene of another deadly fire that shocked the country just four days before the Twin Parks blaze, when 12 people, including nine children, were killed in a fire at a rowhouse public housing unit in the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia. \u201cTwin Parks North West is hardly unique. Most buildings in the Bronx lack what experts would consider 21st-century standards of fire safety,\u201d said Representative Ritchie Torres, who represents the district where Twin Parks is and who introduced the bill to give the fire administration investigatory authority. Ms. Moore-Merrell recalled receiving a call from Mr. Torres as she was leaving Twin Parks a day after the fire. He asked what her agency\u2019s investigation had uncovered, and she explained that the Fire Administration had no investigative power. \u201cJust like there is a federal process for investigating airplane incidents and cyber incidents, there ought to be a comparable process for investigating fire incidents in the hopes of translating the lessons learned into policies and practices that will prevent future fires and save lives,\u201d Mr. Torres said. The Fire Administration\u2019s investigatory powers will not be retroactive, so it will not investigate the Twin Parks fire itself. But other communities at risk of fire death will benefit, said Daniel Madrzykowski, director of research for the UL Fire Safety Research Institute. He said local investigators often focus on finding the cause of a fire whereas the federal government can consider why the fire was so deadly. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t the fire and the smoke contained to the one unit in that fire in the Bronx? Why did it spread throughout the building? Is there a need for a change in building code? Is there a need for a change in building design to prevent that kind of thing from happening in the future?\u201d Mr. Madrzykowski said.\n\nThe number of criminal cases that New York City pursues because of fire safety violations has decreased drastically, prompting fears of less than rigorous enforcement just a year after one of the deadliest fires in decades. City officials said they are pursuing lesser civil charges to speed adjudication, but staffing has become a major issue at many city agencies following the pandemic. \u201cI have yet to see the kind of enhanced enforcement of the fire code that one would expect in the wake of a fire as catastrophic as the one at Twin Parks,\u201d Mr. Torres said. Although legislation passed in 1992 requires multifamily buildings to be built with sprinkler systems, approximately 570,000 multifamily public housing units constructed before the requirement are still in the system, and a \u201csignificant portion\u201d still do not have sprinklers, the Fire Administration report found. Ms. Moore-Merrell said that too many older buildings that serve as affordable housing are grandfathered in and not required to meet the building codes of new construction because of the myth that the improvements are too expensive. \u201cAffordable housing in most of our urban cities is unsafe because it does not come up to code,\u201d Ms. Moore-Merrell said. Also troubling is the increase in fires caused by lithium-ion batteries, particularly those found in e-bikes. New York City Fire Department officials reported that battery fires had killed six people and injured 140 others as of December and that there were 87 more lithium-ion battery fires in the first 11 months of 2022 than there had been in total in the previous year. \u201cNew York, sadly, is leading a trend right now with lithium ion e-scooter and e-bike fires,\u201d said Mr. Madrzykowski.\n\nThe Daily News reported last month that fire officials discovered an e-bike battery in the apartment where the Twin Parks fire started. Though the lithium-ion battery did not cause the fire, officials believe it added to the heavy smoke conditions, the paper reported. Nikeya Gonzalez-Wallace, 46, said she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from the fire, triggered when she smells smoke or hears fire alarms or fire trucks. Although she, like many other former residents, has not returned to Twin Parks, she holds on to happy memories of living there. \u201cIt still is a community,\u201d Ms. Gonzalez-Wallace said. \u201cBut it\u2019s separated.\u201d",

Some analysts say it makes sense strategically.\n\nBAKHMUT, Ukraine \u2014 It was midmorning last Friday when the camera of a Ukrainian drone zoomed in on a Russian soldier moving furtively among trees on the edge of town. Another enemy assault was underway in the eastern city of Bakhmut. The drone pilot marked coordinates as he watched, then sent them by satellite link to artillery commanders. Within a few minutes, Ukrainian artillery units struck the houses where they had seen the Russians taking cover. Smoke from the hits could be seen rising silently on the drone operator\u2019s screen. Later that day, however, an armored vehicle rumbled out of an eastern neighborhood carrying wounded Ukrainian soldiers toward a stabilization point in the city\u2019s west. Ukraine\u2019s army was taking its hits, too.\n\nIn an earlier phase of the war, Ukraine\u2019s leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battles like Bakhmut. President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a rare moment of public self-doubt, mulled then whether the deaths of about 100 Ukrainian soldiers per day in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk were worth the fight for two already ruined cities. But this time, there has been no second-guessing. And new research suggests the lethal urban combat last summer was not as senseless as it might have seemed at the time.\n\nBakhmut\u2019s strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. For Russia, capturing it would be the most significant success in months. In Ukraine, the long battle and heavy losses have turned Bakhmut into a national symbol of defiance. Mr. Zelensky cited the city in a high-profile appearance before the U.S. Congress last month, and presented House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut. (The imperative to \u201cHold Bakhmut,\u201d as Ukrainians say, nevertheless carries some risks, analysts warn, saying that it could cloud military judgment and potentially delay a retreat if one becomes necessary). Viewed from the sky, on the monitor of a drone pilot, Bakhmut slides silently by in sepia hues of brown mud roads, gray rubble of homes and white smoke rising from fires. The stalemate has transformed a swath of ruins and mangled, muddy fields on the city\u2019s eastern rim into scenes reminiscent of World War I: Shell craters are ubiquitous, and the abandoned bodies of Russian soldiers lie about, with Ukrainian troops often complaining of the stink.

Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. \u201cIt\u2019s a place like Verdun in the First World War, where each side is trying to bleed out the other,\u201d Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former American commanding general in Europe, said of the battle of Bakhmut, now in its sixth month. A drone overflight of the wasteland on Thursday recorded a typical scene: two Russian bodies lying on the battlefield beside an artillery crater. \u201cIt looks like apocalypse,\u201d Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who rotated out of Bakhmut last month, said of the area.\n\nSoldiers settle into a familiar routine. Last Friday, a team of Ukrainians careened down a muddy street in a sport utility vehicle, wheeled into a courtyard and piled out, standing next to a wall with rifles ready, just as they do most days. Inside the relative safety of a ruined building, one soldier set about unspooling cable for a satellite link. Another unpacked a drone. They exchanged pleasantries with another unit that happened to be using the same devastated building that day, sharing tea with them and ignoring the booms and rattle of gunfire outside. In czarist times, the city was a trading hub in eastern Ukraine and a center of salt mining. The Soviet authorities renamed it Artyomovsk, after a Bolshevik who helped quash a short-lived Ukrainian independent republic in the early 1920s. Before Russia\u2019s invasion, it was home to red brick merchant houses and universities, nestled between rolling, grassy hills in the eastern Donbas region. Today, about 7,000 people remain of the city\u2019s prewar population of about 100,000, according to Tetiana Scherbak, a director of a volunteer soup kitchen on the western bank, where a few dozen civilians huddled around a wood stove on Friday, warming their hands and charging phones from a generator.\n\nIn the central square, heedless of the explosions, on some days a drunken woman spirals and dances, arms out like a child mimicking the flight of an airplane. She is a character known to the locals who have remained. \u201cEverybody suffers\u201d in her own way, said Svitlana Shpachenko, 54, a former accountant warming up at the soup kitchen. The battle in Bakhmut has been fought in two phases: for the first 100 days or so the Russian regular army was involved, and from then on a private military contracting company, the Wagner Group, which has recruited prisoners into its ranks. The second phase has been the bloodier one, as the Russians have assaulted the city using brigades made up of the convicts. The company\u2019s owner, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and is seen as wanting a victory in Bakhmut to boost his political standing back in Russia, tested new tactics. Many of these units were essentially throwaway soldiers; Ukrainian soldiers have called them human wave assaults. \u201cEssentially they take the brunt of whatever Ukrainian response there is,\u201d said the senior American military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details. \u201cThen you have better trained forces that move behind them to claim the ground that these individuals have walked over.\u201d Serhiy Hrabsky, a former Ukrainian colonel and commentator for the Ukrainian news media, called the fighting around Bakhmut \u201ca completely different nature\u201d of war. Ukraine persists in the city\u2019s defense, he said, in part because \u201ctheir losses are important for us.\u201d\n\nNavara asked not to reveal precise locations but said it could generally be said of the Russians moving into town that \u201cthe bastards are about 800 meters that way,\u201d pointing a finger out the broken window of the building. Not long afterward, Ukrainian artillery hit the Russians as they took cover in an area of deserted and mostly destroyed one- and two-story homes. In the streets of the neighborhood, a firefight was picking up, and the clatter of machine guns echoed about. After a few flights, the drone team drove out by another road, avoiding the street fighting. Private Andriy Pancheko, a member of the drone team, had been working as an electrician in Poland before the invasion but returned and volunteered in the army. Broadly, he said, Ukrainians were defending their country because \u201cif we don\u2019t fight, we won\u2019t have freedom.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA Serbian-born American, he left the impression in his verse that he had \u201cpoked a hole into everyday life to reveal a glimpse of something endless.\u201d\n\nCharles Simic, the renowned Serbian-American poet whose work combined a melancholy old-world sensibility with a sensual and witty sense of modern life, died on Monday at an assisted living facility in Dover, N.H. He was 84. The cause was complications of dementia, his longtime friend and editor Daniel Halpern said. Mr. Simic was a prolific writer who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for \u201cThe World Doesn\u2019t End,\u201d a book of prose poems. He served as poet laureate of the United States from 2007 to 2008. \u201cI am especially touched and honored to be selected,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cbecause I am an immigrant boy who didn\u2019t speak English until I was 15.\u201d His poems defied simple classification. Some were minimalist and surreal, others determinedly realistic and violent. Nearly all were replete with ironic humor and startling metaphors. \u201cOnly a very foolhardy critic would say what any Simic poem is about,\u201d D.J.R. Bruckner wrote in a 1990 profile of Mr. Simic in The New York Times. \u201cIn rich detail they are all filled with ordinary objects, but they tend to leave the impression that the poet has poked a hole into everyday life to reveal a glimpse of something endless.\u201d\n\nMr. Simic\u2019s subject was frequently his World War II-era childhood in Belgrade. In a poem titled \u201cTwo Dogs,\u201d for example, he recalled German soldiers marching past his family\u2019s house in 1944, \u201cthe earth trembling, death going by.\u201d In the poem \u201cCameo Appearance,\u201d he wrote: In a bloody epic. I was one of the In the distance our great leader That\u2019s me there, I said to the kiddies. And the old woman with her mouth open As if she were showing us a tooth. Mr. Simic moved to the United States while in his teens. For the rest of his life he would look back on not merely his wartime childhood but on the circus of everyday life in Belgrade. His poems were full of folk tales and pickpockets and old grudges. In \u201cThe World Doesn\u2019t End,\u201d he wrote: \u201cI was stolen by the gypsies. My parents stole me right back. / Then the gypsies stole me again. This went on for some time.\u201d But he embraced American life. He wrote verse like a man who had escaped a cruel fate and was determined not to waste a moment. His urbane and sardonic poems were increasingly filled with sex and philosophy and blues songs and late-night conversation and time spent at the dinner table.\n\nHe was almost certainly America\u2019s most devoted and ecstatic food poet. One of his poems was titled \u201cCrazy About Her Shrimp.\u201d Another, \u201cCaf\u00e9 Paradiso,\u201d reads in its entirety: Give me your tongue tasting of white beans and garlic, Sexy little assortment of formaggi and frutta! I want to drown with you in red wine like a pear, Then sleep in a macedoine of wild berries with cream. A poet of dichotomies, his work arrived from many angles at once. Writing in The New York Sun, the critic Adam Kirsch unpacked Mr. Simic\u2019s influences: \u201cHe draws on the dark satire of Central Europe, the sensual rhapsody of Latin America, and the fraught juxtapositions of French Surrealism, to create a style like nothing else in American literature. Yet Mr. Simic\u2019s verse remains recognizably American \u2014 not just in its grainy, hard-boiled textures, straight out of 1940s film noir, but in the very confidence of its eclecticism.\u201d He was born Dusan Simic in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia, on May 9, 1938. With the onset of war and the Axis powers\u2019 occupation of his country, his father, an electrical engineer, fled for Italy in 1944 after being arrested several times. The father eventually went on to the United States, but his family was not able to join him there until 1954. The poet would later remark, \u201cMy travel agents were Hitler and Stalin.\u201d The family settled in Chicago, where Charles \u2014 he changed his name after arriving \u2014 learned English and became a committed reader. Recalling the faculty at Oak Park and River Forest High School in suburban Chicago, where he spent his senior year, he told Mr. Bruckner of The Times: \u201cThey did remind you all the time this was the high school of Ernest Hemingway, and that made you wonder who you were. But if they found you were interested in reading they just kept handing books to you.\u201d His parents could not afford to send him to college, but he attended night classes at the University of Chicago while working as a proofreader and office boy for The Chicago Sun-Times. He moved to New York in 1958, where he worked odd jobs while composing poetry at night. \u201cI always wrote in English,\u201d he said, \u201csince I wanted my friends and the girls I was in love with to understand my poems.\u201d\n\nHis first two poems to appear in print were in The Chicago Review in the winter 1959 issue, when he was 21. He was drafted into the Army in 1961 and spent two years as a military policeman in Germany and France. He found his voice, he said, upon his return. \u201cBefore the Army I had become too literary, buttoned down, in tweeds, pipe-smoking, all that,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the Army I had a much humbler view of myself. I started thinking about a remark of the painter Paul Klee, that if a young man is to accomplish something he has to find something truly his own. Well, I had a kind of minimalist urge, and so I started writing poems about the simplest things. Household objects: a knife, a fork, a spoon, my shoes.\u201d In 1964 he married Helen Dubin, a fashion designer. She survives him, along with their daughter, Anna Simic; their son, Philip; a brother, Milan Simich; and two grandchildren. Mr. Simic attended New York University, working at night to pay his tuition. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1966. His first book of poems, \u201cWhat the Grass Says,\u201d was published the next year. The University of New Hampshire offered Mr. Simic an associate professorship in 1973, and he ended up teaching at the school for more than three decades. He won a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant\u201d in 1984.\n\nHe was a regular contributor of criticism and essays to The New York Review of Books. His nonfiction books include \u201cDime-Store Alchemy: The Art of Joseph Cornell\u201d (1992). Mr. Simic frequently returned, in all of his work, to political lessons learned young. He had a lifelong loathing of strident nationalists and ethnic divides, of what he called, in one essay, \u201cso-called great leaders and the collective euphorias they excite.\u201d He lived for many years in rural New Hampshire, yet he refused to romanticize farm life. \u201cWhat about the farmer beyond that gorgeous meadow who works seven days a week from morning to night and is still starving?\u201d he wrote in another essay. \u201cWhat about his sickly wife and their boy, who tortures cats?\u201d He had his own notions of earthiness. \u201cNature as experience \u2014 making a tomato salad, say, with young mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and olive oil \u2014 is better than any idea about Nature.\u201d Mr. Simic was a serious poet and thinker who disliked pretension in any form. He told a Paris Review interviewer: \u201cEvery grand theory and noble sentiment ought to be first tested in the kitchen \u2014 and then in bed, of course.\u201d In a late book of poems \u201cThe Lunatic\u201d (2015), the idea of old age and death seemed to faze him not at all. A spring day made him so happy, he wrote, that even if he had to face a firing squad he would \u201cSmile like a hairdresser / Giving Cameron Diaz a shampoo.\u201d",

Credit...Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nMany names of American service members who died in the conflict are misspelled or missing from the new memorial wall in Washington, relatives and researchers say.\n\nThe Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial may be missing about 500 names, according to family members of Korean veterans.\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. An arc of gleaming black granite slabs etched with 36,634 names was unveiled on the National Mall over the summer, built to honor American service members who died fighting in the Korean War. People like Frederick Bald Eagle Bear, an Army corporal who was killed as he rallied his infantry squad to fend off an enemy attack. And Walder McCord, a bomber pilot who crashed during a night mission. And John Koelsch, a helicopter pilot who was shot down trying to rescue another pilot, died in captivity and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. But Lieutenant Koelsch\u2019s name is spelled wrong, Lieutenant McCord\u2019s name is not on the wall at all, and the name of Frederick Bald Eagle Bear, a member of the Lakota tribe, is so mangled that the polished granite lists him as Eagle B F Bald.\n\nThere are hundreds more mistakes like those. \u201cIt\u2019s just a damn mess \u2014 full of old bookkeeping errors and typos,\u201d said Hal Barker, a historian who, together with his brother, Edward Barker Jr., maintains a vast online repository of information about the conflict, a trove known as the Korean War Project. The brothers estimate that the $22 million wall of remembrance \u2014 an addition to the 27-year-old Korean War Veterans Memorial \u2014 contains 1,015 spelling errors. It also incorrectly includes 245 names of service members who died in circumstances totally unrelated to the war, they say, including a man killed in a motorcycle accident in Hawaii and another who drank antifreeze thinking it was alcohol. And it includes one Marine who lived for 60 years after the war and had eight grandchildren. Beyond that, there are about 500 names that should be listed but are not, according to the Barkers. They say that the official roster used for the wall was so slapdash that they cannot find much rhyme or reason to who was included and who was left out. For example, records show that when Lieutenant McCord\u2019s bomber crashed, nine crew members aboard were killed, but the names of only three are included on the wall. In another case, a Navy plane collided with an Air Force plane off Japan, killing both pilots; the Navy pilot is on the wall, but the Air Force pilot is not.\n\nThe granite slabs were erected by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation to recognize a largely forgotten conflict that left more than a million people dead and a country divided. The money for the project was largely provided by the government of South Korea. Like other monuments on the mall, the slabs are maintained by the National Park Service. The error-riddled list of names was supplied by the Defense Department. And no one seems to have checked it.

The park service deflected blame to the Defense Department. The Defense Department declined to make decision makers available for comment. In response to questions from The New York Times, it acknowledged that there were errors on the wall, saying in a statement that compiling an accurate list was \u201cchallenging.\u201d \u201cWe encourage all family members or concerned citizens to notify the Department of any names that were omitted, misspelled, or included in error,\u201d the statement said, adding that the department would work with the park service to make any necessary corrections or additions, though they did not offer any details of how the granite could be fixed. The brothers said they could think of no options but tearing out the slabs and starting over. It is not the first time the department has botched casualty figures from the conflict in Korea, where three years of bitter fighting ended in stalemate and an armistice in 1953. For nearly 50 years afterward, the official number of American dead from the conflict was 54,246, a number published in history books, quoted in speeches and etched in stone when the Korean War memorial was unveiled. But in 2000, the Pentagon acknowledged that the figure included all troops who had died anywhere, for any reason, during the war years, and that the true number of war deaths was 36,516. Before the carving started on the new wall of names, the Barker brothers repeatedly warned planning commissioners, military officials and eventually even the White House about problems with the list, records show. But the process lumbered forward. \u201cNo one bothered to check it before they set it in stone,\u201d said Edward Barker Jr., who goes by Ted. War memorials that recognize thousands of people were once rare. Arches and obelisks built to honor generals and faceless victories predominated for hundreds of years. And while plaques bearing local names of the fallen have been a familiar small-town sight since the Civil War, national war memorials did not center on exhaustive lists of the dead.\n\nIn recent generations, however, engraved lists have come to be almost expected, as society grew more focused on individuals. Major memorials like those for the Vietnam War and the Sept. 11 terror attacks now prioritize listing masses of people name by name. But as the Korean War wall of remembrance shows, efforts to be inclusive can instead call attention to who was left out. Should the wall include a nurse killed in a plane crash on her way to the war zone? What about a Marine who died by suicide a month after coming home? Even with the best proofreading, any attempt to recognize all who died in as complex an event as a war will inevitably involve hard decisions. For that reason, the National Park Service repeatedly opposed adding the Korean War memorial wall when it was proposed. The service had already waded through controversy over the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, just across the Mall\u2019s reflecting pool, where factions faced off over who deserved to be listed. Years of arguments and lobbying led to the addition of more than 380 names to that granite wall, including one man who died 28 years after he was wounded in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cThere is not always agreement on those names to be included,\u201d the parks service\u2019s deputy director for operations at the time, Peggy O\u2019Dell, warned at a congressional hearing in 2016. \u201cChoosing some names and omitting others causes a place of solace to become a source of hurt.\u201d Erika Doss, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame who has written extensively about monuments, said that Americans increasingly see recognizing individuals as critical. \u201cWe see ourselves as a nation of individuals, so listing the names becomes unifying,\u201d she said. But she wondered how so solemn a gesture could have gotten so flawed this time. She asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t they have an editor?\u201d The mistakes might have attracted little notice if not for the Barker brothers. Ted, 77, and Hal, 75, both 5-foot-6 and partial to loose jeans and white running shoes, share a two-bedroom apartment outside Dallas where, over the years, more and more living space has been ceded to their research. Walls are covered with bulletin boards. Out-of-print books and binders stuffed with obscure infantry rosters weigh down sagging shelves. Hal\u2019s bed is little more than a cot, pushed into a corner to make room for a sprawling homemade desk with six computer monitors where he maintains their project\u2019s website.\n\nHal majored in history in college, and after graduating, he sought out veterans who could tell him about his father. That led to collecting oral histories of nearly forgotten battles. Ted got involved as the project grew, and the brothers created the website in 1995 to share their findings. The site has grown to thousands of pages of maps, photos and profiles, crowdsourced by veterans and their families and meticulously curated by the brothers. In the 1990s, as part of their research, the Barkers started cobbling together a list of all Americans who died in the war. It was based largely on military personnel records entered on IBM punch cards in the 1950s. The cards had room for only a limited number of characters, and could not accommodate hyphenated or multi-word surnames like Bald Eagle Bear, so hundreds of names got scrambled. Much of the data has since been converted to modern digital files, but the errors introduced in the punch-card era endured. So the brothers started checking their list against personnel files, census rolls and gravestones \u2014 work that has taken years. \u201cPeople ask us how we could spend so much effort doing this,\u201d Ted Barker said. \u201cI say, how could we not? We feel we owe it to these guys.\u201d\n\nThen the brothers noticed something odd happening: The Korean War Project website started to be visited thousands of times a day by computers associated with civilian researchers hired by the Defense Department. The brothers grew suspicious that the Defense Department might be paying people to vacuum up their decades of research, rather than engaging directly with them, so in 2020 they sharply limited access to the data and the corrections they had made. The Defense Department did not respond to questions about the brothers\u2019 suspicions. The foundation, whose leaders by now were in their 80s and 90s, pushed the government to deliver a list, as required by law, so the memorial wall could be completed.\n\nThe foundation did not make leaders available for comment for this article. The Pentagon delivered its list in 2021. When the Barkers saw proofs of what would be carved into the granite, they again raised the alarm but said they received little response. Truth be told, the brothers agreed, they never liked the idea of a wall of names. It not only draws dividing lines among the dead, they said, it ignores those who lived \u2014 men like their father who came home but were forever scarred by their experiences. \u201cA wall should have never been done,\u201d Ted Barker said. \u201cBut now that it has been done, we need to get it right.\u201d",

The detentions came after one of the worst attacks on Brazil\u2019s democracy in the 38 years since its military dictatorship ended. On Sunday, thousands of people broke into government offices, falsely claiming the October election was stolen from Jair Bolsonaro, the former president. Here are videos of the Sunday riots. Yesterday, authorities also began dismantling the tent city where Bolsonaro supporters had been camping out since he lost the election. The dispersal was peaceful, despite fears that it could have fueled further tensions. Brazil\u2019s justice minister said that authorities had identified about 40 buses that brought rioters to Bras\u00edlia and that the financial backers of the trips would be tracked down and held responsible. Voices on social media had offered free transportation and food to protesters.\n\nThat\u2019s big news: In 2018, scientists revealed that global emissions of CFC-11, a chemical most likely used to make foam insulation, had increased since 2012. Investigations by The Times and others strongly suggested that small factories in Eastern China disregarding the global ban were the source. In 2018, the head of the U.N. Environment Program said the rogue emissions, if they continued, could delay ozone recovery by a decade. But now, scientists said that ozone levels between the polar regions should reach pre-1980 levels by 2040. Ozone holes should also recover. Ozone: The protective layer in the upper atmosphere blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which can cause skin cancer. Context: The Montreal Protocol, the treaty negotiated in the 1980s to phase out the use of such chemicals, is generally considered to be the most effective global environmental pact ever enacted.\n\nMy colleagues have a major scoop in the world of fine dining: Noma will close for regular service at the end of 2024. The Copenhagen restaurant, which repeatedly tops lists of the world\u2019s best restaurants, will become a full-time food laboratory focused on its e-commerce operation. It will open to diners only for periodic pop-ups. Noma has fundamentally changed gastronomy: Foodies often book flights to Denmark\u2019s capital only after they clinch a reservation. And its creator, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, has been hailed as his era\u2019s most brilliant and influential chef. But Redzepi said that the current model, which changed fine dining forever, was \u201cunsustainable.\u201d Staff at Noma work grueling hours. The workplace culture is intense, and the restaurant long relied on an army of unpaid interns. One alumnus compared the industry to ballet, another elite pursuit that has abuse built into its very model. \u201cWe have to completely rethink the industry,\u201d Redzepi told The Times. \u201cThis is simply too hard, and we have to work in a different way.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nEconomic liberty, not just political liberty, is at the heart of the American experiment. You\u2019re not really free if you don\u2019t have the right to switch jobs or choose what to do with your labor. But millions of American workers can\u2019t fully exercise that choice because of a provision that bosses put into their contracts: a noncompete clause. When you\u2019re subject to a noncompete clause, you lose your right to go work for a competing company or start your own, typically within a certain geographic area and for a certain period of time. Unless you\u2019re willing to move hundreds of miles away or take a huge pay cut to restart your career from scratch, a noncompete can effectively lock you into a job. That\u2019s a clear restriction of individual liberty. But the aggregate impacts of noncompetes go even further. A body of empirical research shows that they also inflict major harm across the economy. In fact, even if you aren\u2019t personally bound by one, noncompetes may be costing you money. Noncompetes were long assumed to apply mainly to high-level executives with access to sensitive corporate information. But their use has exploded in the past few decades, extending far beyond the boardroom. Today, experts estimate that one out of every five American workers, or about 30 million people, is bound by a noncompete. Studies and media reports have found noncompetes routinely invoked against fast-food workers, arborists and manual laborers, to name a few examples. Just this week, the Federal Trade Commission, where I am chair, settled allegations against a company in Michigan that prohibited its workers \u2014 security guards earning at or near the minimum wage \u2014 from going to work for a competitor within a 100-mile radius of their job location for two years. Each worker who violated the noncompete would have been liable for $100,000.\n\nIn theory, noncompete clauses promote investment and innovation by assuring companies that their employees can\u2019t run off with valuable secrets. And, again in theory, workers should be paid more in exchange for agreeing to sign a contract that restricts their autonomy. But the reality looks very different. We know this because over the past few decades, several states restricted the enforceability of noncompete clauses to various degrees, usually because of court decisions. This created natural experiments, allowing researchers to draw causal inferences about their impact. Their most staggering finding: Noncompete clauses systemically drive down wages, even for workers who aren\u2019t bound by one. Every worker stuck in a job represents a position that isn\u2019t opening up for someone else. And if employers know their workers can\u2019t leave, they have less incentive to offer competitive pay and benefits, which puts downward pressure on wages for everyone. Survey data backs up what most people know through experience: Only a small percentage of workers actually bargain over noncompete clauses. In fact, employers often spring them on workers after they\u2019ve accepted a job, when their bargaining power is effectively zero. Surveying the literature, F.T.C. economists conservatively estimate that noncompetes suppress American workers\u2019 income by roughly 3 percent to 4 percent, or $250 billion to $296 billion. Perhaps this would be more forgivable if noncompetes really did spur innovation, helping companies take big swings and bold risks. But here, too, the real-world evidence reviewed by the F.T.C. undermines the theory. As the name implies, noncompete clauses tend to make markets less competitive. Rather than encouraging dynamism and new ideas, they can enable stale incumbents to lock out new rivals. Start-ups are historically a key driver of job creation and innovation, but several studies have found that noncompetes reduce entrepreneurship and start-up formation. How can a new business break into the market if all of the qualified workers are locked in? Or if the would-be founder is bound by a noncompete?\n\nWhen you add it up, the evidence to date suggests that noncompetes suppress wages, reduce competition and keep innovative ideas from breaking into the market. One study even found that noncompetes lead to higher prices for consumers by reducing competition in the heavily concentrated health care sector. Noncompetes are the type of restriction that Section 5 of the F.T.C. Act, a federal law passed by Congress more than a century ago, is supposed to prevent. That\u2019s why the F.T.C. last week proposed a rule forbidding companies to subject workers to noncompetes. Under the proposal, noncompetes would be designated an \u201cunfair method of competition,\u201d which the law prohibits. The rule would apply to professions across the board \u2014 janitors, nurses, engineers, journalists. Because employers often try to use noncompetes even when they\u2019re unenforceable, the rule would require companies to proactively notify employees currently subject to noncompetes that those restrictions are now void. People might worry that eliminating noncompetes would make it impossible for companies to hold on to their secrets. But there is good reason to believe that more-targeted alternatives, such as nondisclosure agreements and trade secret law, would get the job done without imposing such a burden on the economy. We have already seen what life looks like without noncompetes because they have been legally unenforceable in California since the 19th century. Somehow, that hasn\u2019t kept the California economy \u2014 the world\u2019s fifth-largest \u2014 stuck in the Stone Age. Some observers have even suggested that Silicon Valley became the epicenter of America\u2019s tech industry precisely because noncompetes were unenforceable there. As the law professor Ronald Gilson and others have argued, technological progress benefits from the free flow of workers \u2014 and knowledge \u2014 between companies and start-ups. Tying down workers through noncompetes risks blocking this progress. In the wake of the economic recovery from the pandemic, we continue to see a strong labor market and unusually high turnover, with employers complaining that they can\u2019t hire qualified workers. These circumstances only underscore the importance of allowing workers to freely match with the jobs that are right for them. Noncompetes prevent that from happening. Removing them would unlock a tremendous pool of talent, helping employers find and hire the workers they need. At this stage, the F.T.C.\u2019s proposed rule is just that \u2014 a proposal. The public is invited to weigh in during the open commenting period. Hearing from a broad range of voices \u2014 including entrepreneurs, employers and workers who have been subject to noncompetes \u2014 will help ensure that our efforts are based in reality, not abstract theories. A thriving, dynamic economy depends on fair competition \u2014 not just for consumers, but also for workers. We should be skeptical of any methods designed to prevent it. Lina M. Khan is chair of the Federal Trade Commission.",

The brand is part of Danone, which environmental groups say is not doing enough to reduce its use of plastics.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nPARIS \u2014 Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis. The groups accuse Danone \u2014 one of the world\u2019s top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study \u2014 of \u201cfailing to live up to its duties\u201d under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so. \u201cDanone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue,\u201d Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday. A spokeswoman for Danone said the company \u201cstrongly\u201d refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to \u201creduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production. But Monday\u2019s announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.\n\nAdam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France\u2019s statute as toothless because of its vague requirements. But, he added, \u201cthe teeth are in the lawsuits.\u201d By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.\n\nThroughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world\u2019s airplanes combined. Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million \u2014 and is expected to almost triple by 2060. Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic \u2014 about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower \u2014 in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report. The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution. An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone\u2019s shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics. Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.\n\nHe added that plastics were too critical to Danone\u2019s business model for \u201cvoluntary mechanisms\u201d to be effective. \u201cWe need the power of law,\u201d he said. To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity. Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility. The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive. There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee. However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies\u2019 use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment. In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.\n\nCatherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations. Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws \u201cdesigned to protect investors and companies\u201d in order to press them to better address environmental issues. \u201cNow, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a step change.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWarming temperatures in one part of the world seem to have driven down the parasite population, suggesting another unexpected way that climate change harms ecosystems.\n\nMost people assume that a warmer planet will be a buggier, more parasite- and disease-ridden place. There are plenty of examples to justify this fear. Climate change is already expanding the range of ticks that spread Lyme disease; mosquitoes that transmit malaria and Zika; and nocturnal, biting kissing bugs that drive Chagas\u2019 disease infections. But while some parasitic species are getting a boost from climate change, they may be the exception rather than the rule. According to a groundbreaking study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that analyzed 85 parasitic species, the majority suffered population declines over 140 years, on par with some of the most threatened wildlife species \u2014 or worse. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of decline that triggers conservation action for mammals and birds, and that gets people riled,\u201d said Chelsea Wood, a parasite ecologist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. It might sound counterintuitive, but this is not good news. Forty to 50 percent of all animal species on Earth are parasites, or organisms that live in or on a host and depend on it for survival, at that host\u2019s expense. That figure does not even count certain bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoans that are also considered to be parasitic. Yet very little is known about these wildly abundant, diverse life-forms. Most discussion of parasites involves species that negatively affect us, our pets, our livestock or our children. But these malignant species are in the extreme minority.\n\nAs scientists learn more about the hundreds of thousands of other parasitic species that do not harm humans, a picture of animal groups that play key roles in maintaining healthy ecosystems is emerging. For instance, parasites keep species populations in check just like predators do. Parasites also help to push energy up the food web, by making prey species behave more recklessly and become easier for predators to catch. California killifish infected with a trematode flatworm, for example, are 10 times to 30 times more likely to become meals for birds than uninfected fish. In Japan, nematomorph worms goad their cricket hosts into jumping into streams, providing up to 60 percent of total calories for endangered Japanese char. \u201cPredators are getting an assist from parasites,\u201d Dr. Wood said.\n\nUntil now, scientists were mostly left to guess how climate change and other anthropogenic pressures were affecting parasites. To answer this question, Dr. Wood and her colleagues turned to 699 fish specimens, most of which were kept in the basement of the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle. The fish, which were collected between 1880 and 2019 in the Puget Sound of Washington State, were \u201cparasite time capsules,\u201d Dr. Wood said. The formalin and ethanol that suspended the fish in time at the moments of their death also preserved the worms and other organisms attached to their gills and skin or burrowed into their muscles and innards. Meticulous dissection of these specimens revealed 17,702 parasites that were members of 85 different species, allowing Dr. Wood and her colleagues to infer how population abundance has changed over time.\n\n\u201cThere is no data set like this in the world,\u201d said Skylar Hopkins, a parasite ecologist at North Carolina State University, who was not involved in the research. \u201cJust imagine how long it took them to dissect all those stinky, ancient fish.\u201d Controlling for other factors like pollution and fluctuating fish populations, the team found that across all species, parasites declined by 38 percent for every degree Celsius of temperature increase. Some species were harmed more than others. Parasites with complex life cycles \u2014 the 52 percent of species in the study that require three, four or even five hosts to make it from egg to adult \u2014 declined by almost 11 percent every decade, a finding that was significantly associated with sea surface temperature. \u201cThe hotter it got, the fewer of those parasites we found,\u201d Dr. Wood said.\n\nThe \u201cremarkable\u201d data set gathered by Dr. Wood and colleagues showed \u201cthat losses in parasite diversity can be measured and are substantial,\u201d said Armand Kuris, a parasite ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThis is disturbing news.\u201d Kevin Lafferty, a disease ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, who also was not involved in the research, said it makes sense that parasites with complex life cycles are \u201cthe first to go,\u201d because they have evolved to exploit complex ecosystems. Around the world, climate change, pollution, overfishing and other human-caused stressors are steadily chipping away at nature\u2019s complexity, leading to simpler systems that no longer seem to be able to support the careful choreography of a multihost lifestyle. As Dr. Lafferty said, such parasites are, \u201cto use a tired phrase, canaries in the coal mine.\u201d Scientists cannot say yet if the findings from the Puget Sound generalize to other ecosystems. Dr. Wood and her colleagues have already started analyzing fish specimens from the Gulf of Alaska as well as the Rio Grande, the Pearl River in Louisiana and Mississippi and the Alabama River. She also hopes to see other ecologists making use of \u201cthe treasure trove\u201d of museum specimens that exist around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of effort to dissect fish preserved with chemicals \u2014 and it\u2019s not the most glamorous work \u2014 but it\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d Dr. Wood said. What the findings do say for sure, she added, is that parasites are in need of conservation, just like any other species. \u201cParasites are playing these vital roles in ecosystems that will disappear when they do, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll notice how important they are.\u201d",

A new global class of gastro tourists schedules first-class flights and entire vacations around the privilege of paying at least $500 per person for its multicourse tasting menu. Noma has repeatedly topped lists of the world\u2019s best restaurants, and its creator, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, has been hailed as his era\u2019s most brilliant and influential chef. Nevertheless, Mr. Redzepi told The New York Times, the restaurant will close for regular service at the end of 2024. Noma will become a full-time food laboratory, developing new dishes and products for its e-commerce operation, Noma Projects, and the dining rooms will be open only for periodic pop-ups. His role will become something closer to chief creative officer than chef.\n\nThis move is likely to send shock waves through the culinary world. To put it in soccer terms: Imagine that Manchester United decided to close Old Trafford stadium to fans, though the team would continue to play. The decision comes as Noma and many other elite restaurants are facing scrutiny of their treatment of the workers, many of them paid poorly or not at all, who produce and serve these exquisite dishes. The style of fine dining that Noma helped create and promote around the globe \u2014 wildly innovative, labor-intensive and vastly expensive \u2014 may be undergoing a sustainability crisis.\n\nThe chef David Kinch, who last week closed his three-Michelin-starred restaurant Manresa, in Los Gatos, Calif., said, \u201cthe last 30 years were a gilded age,\u201d when ambitious restaurants multiplied and became less formal and more exciting.

Mr. Redzepi denied that any of those factors prompted the decision to close Noma\u2019s doors. Instead, he said, operating at the high level that has earned Noma international adulation had long felt untenable. But until the Covid pandemic kept him at home, he said, he had never stopped working long enough to question whether the whole business model might be broken. For the last decade, Mr. Redzepi, 45, has been on a rather public spiritual journey, embracing therapy, coaching and walking meditation in order to exorcise the famously rageful, mercurial and workaholic young chef he was when he opened Noma in 2003. He said that process brought him to this breaking point. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable,\u201d he said of the modern fine-dining model that he helped create. \u201cFinancially and emotionally, as an employer and as a human being, it just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an ideal restaurant, employees could work four days a week, feel empowered and safe and creative,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said. \u201cThe problem is how to pay them enough to afford children, a car and a house in the suburbs.\u201d Mr. Redzepi\u2019s reputation was built on his challenges to fine-dining tradition, most famously discarding imported delicacies like French foie gras and Italian truffles in favor of local and foraged ingredients like spruce tips, two-year-old carrots and duck brains. The cooking style became known as New Nordic, and swept all of Scandinavia into a new status as an elite culinary destination. Scores of chefs have moved to Denmark to study Mr. Redzepi\u2019s work, then spread his style to other countries; having a Noma pedigree opens doors and investors\u2019 wallets all over the world, several alumni said. Frequent keynote speeches at food summits have elevated Mr. Redzepi to the role of global visionary. He has been knighted by the queen of Denmark, and published a book on leadership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation.\n\nFor most of that time, Ms. Hegde said, her sole job was to produce fruit-leather beetles, starting with a thick jam of black fruit and silicone stencils with insect parts carved out. Another intern taught her how to spread the jam evenly, monitor the drying process, then use tweezers to assemble the head, thorax, abdomen and wings. Ms. Hegde repeated the process until she had 120 perfect specimens; each diner was served a single beetle in a wooden box. She said the experience taught her to be quick, quiet and organized, but little about cooking. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would use my knife only a couple of times a day,\u201d she said, \u201cor that I would be told I didn\u2019t need my tasting spoon because there was nothing to taste.\u201d Ms. Hegde said she was required to work in silence by the junior chefs she assisted (Mr. Redzepi was rarely in the kitchen where she worked), and was specifically forbidden to laugh. \u201cI thought an internship was about me learning, as well about contributing to Noma\u2019s success,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that kind of toxic work environment is necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Noma spokeswoman said that all restaurant workers are expected to perform repetitive tasks, and that Ms. Hegde\u2019s account \u201cdoes not reflect our workplace or the experience we wish for our interns or anyone on our team.\u201d The fact that exploitation and abuse in kitchens persist, even in protective societies like Denmark\u2019s, has recently been highlighted by the Danish activist Lisa Lind Dunbar, an industry veteran in Copenhagen (who has not worked at Noma). She and a dozen other people said a code of loyalty among Noma alumni, including chefs at many of Copenhagen\u2019s top restaurants, makes it impossible for workers at those restaurants to speak out about working conditions, sexual harassment and other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mafia mentality, and he is the don,\u201d she said of Mr. Redzepi. \u201cNo one defies him publicly or privately.\u201d The Noma spokeswoman responded, \u201cThat is not something we recognize as accurate.\u201d She also said that he has long acknowledged these systemic problems, and worked to change them. But Ms. Dunbar said Mr. Redzepi had two decades to do that. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t tried enough,\u201d she said.\n\nSo what will become of the Noma brand? Mr. Redzepi said it has not made him wealthy, because his commitment to high-quality ingredients and flawless execution is so costly. He declined to provide specifics, but according to public records, he is a majority owner of Noma, and part owner of multiple popular ventures run by Noma alumni. Opening satellite restaurants around the world, as many chefs have done to increase revenue, would not solve the problem, he said. \u201cI have been offered countless blank checks in Qatar. It doesn\u2019t entice me.\u201d Mr. Redzepi, who has been cooking professionally since age 15, said he had long wanted out of the \u201cproduction line\u201d aspect of restaurant cooking. He said advance commitments and building Noma Projects \u2014 including a new production facility, with 60 to 70 full-time employees \u2014 are the reason the change will not take effect for nearly two years. \u201cI hope we can prove to the world that you can grow old and be creative and have fun in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of hard, grueling, low-paid work under poor management conditions that wears people out.\u201d Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

Certainly not with all those adorable brussels sprouts and multicolored cauliflower heads flaunting their charms.\n\nYet cabbages are revered in cultures around the world. The French like them so much that they call their sweethearts \u201cpetits choux,\u201d or little cabbages. In Greek mythology, cabbages sprang from the tears of Lycurgus, king of Thrace, after he was driven mad by Dionysus; thus, they were considered a remedy for drunkenness. And, of course, there\u2019s Cabbage Man, the veggie vendor in the animated television series \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender,\u201d whose cruciferous cargo somehow always gets overturned.\n\nI adore cabbage in all its forms, but, apart from the occasional heap of coleslaw on a pulled pork sandwich, my husband and daughter turn up their noses at it. Which means that cabbage and I have had to go it alone. At least so far.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to tempt them with Cybelle Tondu\u2019s new recipe for scrunched cabbage salad with fried almonds (above). She borrows a technique for kale salad, massaging the sturdy leaves to soften them, and then tosses them with a lemony dressing and olive oil-fried sesame seeds and nuts. Now that\u2019s a cabbage treat!",

Defendants who are indicted can request speedy trials that begin by the close of the term that follows the two-month period in which they are indicted. Because of those protocols, most charges would most likely be brought at the beginning of the next grand jury term in early March, or further down the road.\n\nThe office of Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, has spent two years investigating whether Mr. Trump and his allies violated any Georgia laws as they tried to overturn President Biden\u2019s victory there in 2020. Prosecutors are known to have informed nearly 20 people that they may face criminal charges as a result of the investigation. Their targets include Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, and David Shafer, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party.\n\nIt is not yet clear if Mr. Trump himself is at risk of facing charges in the investigation.\n\nIn court papers, Ms. Willis\u2019s office has said that it is investigating \u201ca multistate, coordinated plan by the Trump campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere.\u201d Her team has weighed possible conspiracy and racketeering charges, among others. Among the evidence she has examined is the phone call that Mr. Trump made on Jan. 2, 2021, to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, imploring him to \u201cfind\u201d nearly 12,000 votes, or enough to reverse the outcome of the presidential election in the state. At the time, Mr. Trump had not yet conceded to Mr. Biden.\n\nThe creation of an alternate slate of bogus Georgia presidential electors after the 2020 election has also been a subject of intense scrutiny, and some legal analysts have said that scheme in particular could lead to charges under the state\u2019s version of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO. Each of the Trump electors has been told they are a target who could face charges, according to their lawyers or related court filings.\n\n\u201cWhen we see what a large group of people was working together on the Georgia fake elector scheme \u2014 from the former president, his chief of staff, his personal attorneys down to local campaign officials and lawyers in Georgia \u2014 the district attorney\u2019s possible interest in bringing RICO charges makes more and more sense,\u201d said Clark D.

            "content": "After Damar Hamlin was injured in a game on Jan. 2, Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals, center, warmed up briefly before the game was suspended.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nESPN told viewers that players were given five minutes to warm up after Hamlin was taken off the field. The N.F.L. denied that. On Sunday, Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the question.\n\nNearly a week after Buffalo Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest during a Jan. 2 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Commissioner Roger Goodell for the first time addressed one of the lingering questions about how the N.F.L. handled the crisis: why players were told to prepare to restart the game after an ambulance carrying Hamlin left the field. In a radio interview Sunday, Goodell acknowledged that it was \u201cstandard practice\u201d to resume play after an injury, but he didn\u2019t say who, if anyone, ordered the players back onto the field. Joe Buck, ESPN\u2019s lead announcer that night, said four times that the players had been given five minutes to warm up, and the network showed Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow throwing a ball and Bills receiver Stefon Diggs addressing his teammates. According to several executives of networks that show N.F.L. games, the league has the ability to correct announcers during broadcasts. It does not appear that they sent word to Buck to tell him that he was providing incorrect information. The warm-ups came to an abrupt end after Bengals Coach Zac Taylor crossed the field to speak with Bills Coach Sean McDermott, and the two men consulted with the head referee, Shawn Smith. Both teams left for the locker room soon after. The league did not officially suspend the game until around 10 p.m. Eastern, just over an hour after Hamlin\u2019s collapse, and about 40 minutes after the players returned to their locker rooms. Goodell said that after the league received \u201cfeedback that it may not be appropriate\u201d to restart the game, Troy Vincent, the league\u2019s executive vice president for football operations, \u201cmade the decision to suspend play, which was the right decision, and allow everyone to go back and let\u2019s gather ourselves and get more information which was clear we needed to do.\u201d\n\nStill, in the absence of other communication from the league, viewers were led to believe that the N.F.L. had ordered the game to be restarted even though many players were visibly shaken and some were in tears. D.J. Reader, a Bengals defensive tackle, confirmed that he and his teammates had received instructions to warm up, but he added that the players were in no position to restart the game. He said doing so would have been \u201cdamn near impossible.\u201d \u201cIt was communicated to the coaches or whatever and it was just like, \u2018We might have a little warm-up period; we\u2019ll figure it out some more,\u2019\u201d Reader, one of the team\u2019s union representatives, said last week. \u201cEverybody\u2019s backtracking on what was said now, this, that or the third. Who knows. I know that we were about to warm up and get back out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times we were prepared to make that decision, the players wanted to continue discussing it with their teams. And we had to give them that opportunity,\u201d Goodell said. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What\u2019s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. But in a news conference last week, leaders of the N.F.L. Players Association were critical of how the league had handled the situation. They said that as soon as the severity of Hamlin\u2019s medical emergency was known, they made it clear to league officials that they did not believe the game should resume that night. DeMaurice Smith, the union\u2019s executive director, said that the players and the coaches in Cincinnati should not have been put in a position to decide whether the game should continue that night, an apparent swipe at Goodell\u2019s leadership. The players could not simply have refused to return to the field because that could have been considered an illegal strike in violation of their labor agreement with the N.F.L. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be a players\u2019 call, I don\u2019t think it should be a coaches\u2019 call,\u201d Smith said in a news conference last week. \u201cI think given the severity of the injury and what the players witnessed, that it needed to be a call that the N.F.L. needed to make.\u201d About three hours after Hamlin\u2019s collapse, on a conference call with reporters, Vincent muddied the waters when he denied that the league had wanted to restart the game. He said that the only instructions the league gave were for Smith, the referee, to communicate with both coaches and make sure they had enough time inside the locker room to consider their options. Vincent\u2019s comments created a firestorm because they implied that ESPN\u2019s reporting was incorrect. This led to a rare rebuke of the N.F.L. from one of the league\u2019s broadcast partners. On Tuesday, the network said that there had been constant communication with the league and that \u201cwe reported what we were told in the moment.\u201d",

Here\u2019s the latest at the end of Monday.\n\n1. At least 1,200 people were detained in Brazil after rioters stormed its capital buildings. Thousands of supporters of Brazil\u2019s former president, Jair Bolsonaro, broke into government buildings yesterday to protest what they falsely claim was a stolen election. In scenes reminiscent of the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters laid siege to offices, set fires, knocked police officers from horseback and filmed their violent acts as they committed them. It was a turbulent culmination of years of conspiracy theories advanced by the former president and his allies, and one of the worst attacks on the country\u2019s democracy since the end of a military dictatorship 38 years ago. By this afternoon, hundreds had been arrested, and the tent city where many protesters were staying since the election in October had been taken down.\n\n3. The new House Republican majority faces its next test. Kevin McCarthy, who early on Saturday morning narrowly maneuvered his path to becoming House speaker, is now racing to corral his Republican colleagues on their next order of business: establishing the rules of the House. The measures, which are expected to receive a vote tonight, include several concessions made by McCarthy to secure his leadership spot, including opening up spending bills to unlimited amendments. History suggests that the procedural tweaks are likely to lead to more gridlock and legislative instability. In other politics news, President Biden traveled to the border, arriving amid a historic surge in illegal immigration and anger from both parties about how he is handling it. Also, a special grand jury that investigated Donald Trump and his allies over suspicions of 2020 election interference in Georgia has finished its work. A hearing will be held to determine whether a report will be made public.\n\nYesterday, less than a week after Hamlin\u2019s on-field injury brought the football world to a horrifying halt, the Bills cruised to a comfortable victory over the Patriots. The game, which the league effectively dedicated to Hamlin, felt like a both a vigil and a celebration. The focus, for the most part, was not on the inherent violence of the sport but on the inspiring ways in which the community came together during one of its darkest moments. It\u2019s further proof of the N.F.L.\u2019s narrative power, our columnist writes, which gives it the durability to survive just about any crisis. This afternoon, Hamlin was released from intensive care and transported to a hospital in Buffalo, doctors said.\n\n7. Has Prince Harry\u2019s confessional tour run its course? Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, have for the last two years been on a storytelling streak: sitting down with Oprah, making a Netflix series and most recently going on a promotional tour for \u201cSpare,\u201d Harry\u2019s highly anticipated memoir, set for release tomorrow. They have largely found support, particularly in the U.S., where they were seen as victims of a reactionary and even racist British royal family. But as more of Harry\u2019s grievances are revealed, our critic writes, the tide seems to be turning against him.\n\n8. Noma, which has repeatedly topped lists of the world\u2019s best restaurants, is closing. Since opening two decades ago, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s Copenhagen restaurant has transformed fine dining. But in a shock to the culinary world, it announced that it would close for regular service at the end of 2024. The decision comes as Noma and many other elite restaurants are facing scrutiny of their treatment of their workers. The style of fine dining that Noma helped create and promote around the globe \u2014 wildly innovative, labor-intensive and vastly expensive \u2014 may also be undergoing a sustainability crisis. Our restaurant critic wrote that Noma is surprisingly still original, but he can\u2019t quite say he\u2019ll be sorry when it\u2019s gone. \u201cIts excellence had become inseparable from the culture of overkill that now defines the windswept high peaks of fine dining,\u201d he wrote.\n\n9. As theaters bring more diversity to the stage, sign language translators try to keep up. Amid a recent racial reckoning in the industry, theatrical interpreters from a variety of backgrounds have become increasingly sought after. Some deaf viewers say a mismatch in the racial alignment between sign language interpreters and the actors onstage can be jarring, and a better match can help the viewer form a more immediate connection with a show. In other arts news, \u201cM3gan,\u201d a campy horror movie starring a mean-girl robot, beat box office expectations in its first weekend. The movie reminds us of the amusement and deep unease that dancing robots often provoke.\n\n10. And finally, how to focus like it\u2019s 1990. You may have noticed: Ever since technology has taken a central role in our lives, our concentration has become more fleeting. One study found that office workers now spend a mere 47 seconds on a computer task before moving on. Looking to buck the trend, our Well desk asked experts for advice on how to improve sustained focus. Suggestions include turning off notifications on your phone and making time in your day for a \u201ctech break.\u201d",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "The full story of the N.B.A. over the last decade could not be told without Draymond Green. The raw nerve of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, Green is also one of the league\u2019s most accomplished players. He\u2019s a four-time all-star, four-time N.B.A. All-Defensive First Team selection as well as a former defensive player of the year, and a two-time Olympic gold medal winner. He\u2019s also one of the game\u2019s most compelling personalities, on court and off: equally capable of baffling hotheadedness and coolly cerebral basketball brilliance. This season, though, has so far progressed under something of a cloud for Green, whose assertive play and emotionality have often made him a lightning rod for pundits and opposing teams\u2019 fans. During a preseason practice, Green, who is 32 and who has his own successful podcast, punched his teammate Jordan Poole \u2014 an altercation caught on tape. That event presaged what has been a slog of a season for the Warriors, which, this past June, won its fourth championship of Green\u2019s 11-year tenure. At least, that\u2019s how it may look to outsiders. \u201cThe average person thinks they understand what they\u2019re watching,\u201d Green says about N.B.A. observers. \u201cThey have no idea.\u201d\n\nBecause of the way you play and how you can carry yourself on the court, other teams\u2019 fans can really give you the business sometimes. I know athletes always say they ignore booing and stuff like that, but you\u2019re still human; I can\u2019t believe it doesn\u2019t register. So just as a person, what is it like to experience 20,000 people yelling at you? Does it ever make you feel vulnerable out there? In most cases it\u2019s something you grow numb to. Not that it doesn\u2019t bother you, but it\u2019s kind of like, is it supposed to bother me every time? Or do you adjust to your surroundings? For most of us, you adjust. The one time that caught me off guard was Boston in the finals because it was way more nasty than I had ever seen before. I had never openly heard so many racist remarks while on the court. That made it a little different. But as far as heckling, it\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t bother you, it\u2019s how often are you going to let it bother you?\n\nHave you ever talked with any of the Celtics\u2019 players about what happened last year in Boston? Just because it sounds like the crowd went past partisanship and into something nastier. It seems like that would be an unsettling experience for the Celtics\u2019 guys too, given that the fans who were yelling racist expletives at you were, at least putatively, their supporters. I\u2019ve never spoken to them about that. I don\u2019t think their experience is going to be my experience, so I could kind of care less. Their experience is probably great. Celtics have a die-hard fan base that\u2019s going to root hard for the Celtics. But my experience with their fans was a bit different. Quite frankly, when you\u2019re playing in the N.B.A. finals you\u2019re trying to get any advantage you can to win that game. I didn\u2019t expect any of them to reach out to me or wonder how I was feeling about their environment. If I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m not reaching out to someone if that were me. But the way I was \u2014 the things that were chanted at me were even glorified by our league. I watched people from our league say it\u2019s OK and a part of the game. So, you know, I understood that the important thing was not getting too deep in my feelings about it. I had to go win the championship, and that\u2019s what I did.\n\nSurely no one in the league condoned fans\u2019 yelling racist expletives? Well, they didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t OK to say the things that were said to me. It is what it is.\n\nI know that for you having the podcast is a way to share a perspective that the nonplayer media can\u2019t have. But when I\u2019ve listened to it, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re saying things that are all that far away from what pundits or analysts are saying. So what do you understand and bring to listeners that the media doesn\u2019t? Most of them don\u2019t understand the X\u2019s and O\u2019s. I always tell people \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying it from an egregious place; I\u2019m saying it from a logical place \u2014 you can\u2019t possibly think you understand basketball as much as me. I study this for numerous hours daily. There are guys that play in the N.B.A. that don\u2019t know the game of basketball, and yet most people think, Oh, I know the game. No, you don\u2019t! And by the way, I\u2019m not saying you have to play or coach in the N.B.A. to know the game of basketball. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s hard to know the game, and very few actually do. No one\u2019s going to value me going on CNBC and breaking down the stock market. No one\u2019s going to look for me to walk into their doctor\u2019s office and say, \u201cActually, that\u2019s this and not that.\u201d You know why? Because I don\u2019t study that. That\u2019s not my expertise. But still people think they know basketball!\n\nWhat about when criticism comes from a former player like Shaq, who said the league is soft now, or Charles Barkley, who said you\u2019re not the player you were? Yeah, Charles Barkley went out and said I lost a step. My coach was telling me how I was moving about as good as ever! I work with Charles. Charles doesn\u2019t always watch the games. I don\u2019t take it personal. Went through one ear and out the other. As far as Shaq saying the league is softer, that\u2019s fine. But we didn\u2019t make it softer. The rules made it softer. I would have loved to hand-check somebody if I could. I would love to clothesline somebody and we just get up and walk to the free-throw line and continue playing if I could. We didn\u2019t make those rule changes, nor do we have any say-so. So if Shaq feels that the game is softer, guess what? It is. But I don\u2019t agree that players are softer, and that\u2019s not what he said. He said the game is softer. I agree.\n\nYou\u2019ve said elsewhere that growing up in Saginaw, Mich., under not the easiest circumstances, is where your toughness comes from. Your kids are obviously going to grow up in much more comfortable circumstances. Do you ever think about how they\u2019ll develop the toughness that you were forced to develop? Their lives are so different from yours. It\u2019s something I think of daily. Things I want to give to my kids, certain traits, were built in Saginaw, Mich., growing up in the circumstances that we grew up in. My kids aren\u2019t growing up in Saginaw, Mich. Nowhere near it. So how do they get that same toughness, those same lessons, without going through those same things? The reality is they don\u2019t. What I\u2019ve had to understand is that my children will have toughness, because they\u2019ll get it from my wife and me, but it won\u2019t be the same type of toughness that we had. My son DJ doesn\u2019t have to have the same toughness that I had growing up because I needed that to walk to school every day. That\u2019s not his reality. The type of toughness that he needs is totally different. It took me a while to understand that.\n\nHow do you? It\u2019s that every day as a parent is another opportunity and obligation to understand your child. You think you\u2019ve got your kid figured out, and then their perspective changes. So it\u2019s daily wanting to better understand my children, no matter how good I may believe that I understand them. Number two, it\u2019s having conversations with fathers that I respect, that are in similar positions, and not being afraid to share your challenges. Because parenthood is not easy. It is not easy at all. But every day you have to make that decision to try to be a great parent. You have to try to figure out what are your best things that you want to give to your kids. And I\u2019m not speaking of materialistic things. I\u2019m speaking of lessons you want to instill.\n\nWhat\u2019s the lesson you learned from what happened with Jordan Poole? I think I\u2019ve learned a ton about myself, my temperament, about how to deal with things. I\u2019ve also learned that\u2019s a daily thing, that work that you\u2019re doing in order to better yourself. I\u2019m still not sure that I can say I can 100 percent process the \u201cwhy,\u201d but what I am certain of is that it\u2019s led me to doing work to better myself. For so long, I stopped doing that work. It\u2019s one thing when you\u2019re not doing something to better yourself and it affects you, but when it starts affecting others, you have to check yourself. You\u2019ve got to put the work in to make sure that you do as much as you can to not do things that negatively impact other people.\n\nI know that when you were a kid, you used to have seizures, and you took medication for them until you were in your late 20s. I can imagine that being a scary thing, and also something that had psychological and emotional ripples or caused you to find ways to compensate for that vulnerability. What\u2019s your sense of how that experience affected the kind of basketball player or person you are? I don\u2019t think it affected who I was, who I am, because my mom never allowed it to. My mom is super strong. My mom never really even explained to me the depth of my seizures until a year ago. Never once until a year ago! She said, \u201cI never wanted you to believe the things that the doctors were saying \u2014 \u2018you should never drive, never play basketball, never swim\u2019 \u2014 I never wanted you to believe that, so I encouraged you to do everything that any other child would do.\u201d Would it have affected me more if I didn\u2019t have the mother that I have? I believe it would have. So I\u2019m thankful for my mother. But how did it affect me as a basketball player? The side effects of the medicine definitely stunted my growth. I was on that medication 20-plus years. My wingspan is 7-1. I\u2019m 6-5-and-\u00be. I was expected to be somewhere from 6-8 to 6-10. I think a lot about those things.\n\nJust to stick with the Jordan Poole incident: You correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but my reading of what happened is that Poole said something to needle you, probably about money, it set you off and then you reacted the way you did. But you were saying that any specifics are less important than learning why you reacted that way and how to react differently in the future? No, because I\u2019ve been in this league 11 years, and that\u2019s never happened before. So it\u2019s not like, man, I can never let that happen again \u2014 as if it\u2019s not a once-in-a-million chance that what happened before will ever happen again anyway! What I\u2019m saying is that in doing personal work, what he said has no bearing. If what he said is the reason that I want to continue to do work on myself, then I\u2019m missing the boat. If you\u2019re just going to blame it on what he said, good luck on the personal work, because that\u2019s deflecting. So when I say what he said is irrelevant, I\u2019m saying that from the standpoint of, Let me not deflect.\n\nLet me ask about this a different way: In the TNT documentary that aired right after the punch happened, you said you were going to have to process the \u201cwhy\u201d of it. So as best you can, now with the benefit of hindsight, can you explain the why? It\u2019s why the situation ever reached that point, why I reacted the way I reacted. All of those things are part of understanding that why. That\u2019s not something that you just come up with. I think if I could sit here and tell you right now the \u201cwhy,\u201d it would show you how confused I am. Because those reactions are built over time. You have to learn so much about yourself to get to the bottom of something like that. That takes time.\n\nAnd how should we understand what happened with Jordan Poole in the context of the team\u2019s culture, which people have pointed to in the past as being uniquely positive or joyful? Our culture is our culture, and there are things within that that we have to figure out. I could go blue in the face trying to get people to understand or not, but I play a team sport, and things about that incident \u2014 it still matters to the makeup of our team. Making sure that we can do what we set out to do is more important than wanting someone to know more. Because wanting someone to know more benefits me. Making sure that my team is right and together benefits my team, myself, our families, video coordinators, coaches, equipment managers, marketing staff, our community-relations staff, our public-relations staff. It\u2019s bigger than me. I\u2019d rather work on that than try to get someone to further understand my point of view.\n\nIs the idea of an upbeat, good-vibes winning culture just a fantasy anyway? Because maybe tension is necessary for winning \u2014 so many dynasties have had some player who was an emotional wild card. Or maybe the simple truth is that if you\u2019re winning then it\u2019s easy to say culture has something to do with it, but if you\u2019re losing then culture\u2019s not going to help. Winning is hard. Being that it is very hard, it\u2019s impossible that it\u2019s going to feel good all the time. If you\u2019re not having miscommunications, if you\u2019re not having disagreements, that means you\u2019re not doing the things to challenge each other to make each other better, which, in turn, means you are probably not winning. You can be the most joyous person in the world; if you\u2019re losing every game, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to produce much joy. It becomes hard to have unity if you\u2019re getting crushed every game.\n\nInsofar as you\u2019re able to separate the objective observer who knows basketball from the subjective participant, is Golden State still a team that can win a championship? That window has to close eventually. The same people that are talking now were talking last year and said we had no chance. And I said then, it still hasn\u2019t been proven when Steph, Klay and myself were together, fully whole, that anyone can stop us. Until someone proves that they can then there\u2019s nothing to make me believe it. There\u2019s no evidence. \u201cWell, you should believe this because of \u2018X.\u2019\u201d No. No one has figured it out yet. Yeah, you go through tough parts of the season, and we started the season awful. I mean, even this year the teams that separated themselves \u2014\n\nLike Boston? Yeah, well, we know historically that we probably shouldn\u2019t worry about that because they\u2019ve yet to beat us. That\u2019s how I see it.\n\nHere\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been curious about as a fan: Anybody who makes the N.B.A. is a physical genius. But then you see certain guys who refuse to change their games even though they must be physically capable. I\u2019m thinking of players like Ben Simmons, who has that mental block about shooting, or Russell Westbrook, who\u2019d like to play like the guy he was five years ago. Are those examples of inability to adjust or unwillingness? Is it just stubborn pride? When you\u2019re speaking of players\u2019 ability or inability to adjust, to say pride doesn\u2019t play a role would be a lie. The reality is, to put yourself in the position to where it\u2019s even up to you if you will or can adjust \u2014 you\u2019re in that position due to the pride that you have. That pride has led to certain levels of success. You then ask somebody to essentially disregard what has worked for them? To ignore the pride in it would be foolish. Some of it could be inability because what they\u2019re asking you to adjust to, you may not possess that skill anymore because you have not used that skill in so long. So it could be a bit of both. Or it could be you don\u2019t care.\n\nHave you had teammates who didn\u2019t care? I\u2019ve definitely had teammates who I didn\u2019t feel cared. I never view it as someone\u2019s just there for the check, because you have to put a lot of work in to get there. But there are guys in the league that care more about other things as opposed to winning. You run into guys that\u2019ll rather score points than win. Rather get double-doubles than win.\n\nAt this stage of your career, how high up is money on the list of factors that you\u2019ll be thinking about when you become eligible to be a free agent after the season? My family, my children: That is a constant that has to be protected and considered at all times. That\u2019s most important. But there are so many different things to take into consideration. Of course money. You have a finite time to make the most money that you can make playing basketball. It\u2019s not like I can do this until I\u2019m 50. Winning is important. Geography \u2014 where you\u2019re living, quality of life. I can say these are the things that you\u2019re going to take into account, but those things can change from now to August. Now, saying that, I\u2019ve been here 11 years. It\u2019s not often you have the opportunity to build something special with guys that you enjoy and appreciate, and their skill sets complement each other, and the most important thing for everyone is winning. I don\u2019t take that for granted. You find something great, you ride that as long as you can. But you also don\u2019t know what your options are going to be. So to try to weigh those things and say it has to be X, Y and Z? LeBron James can do that. Kevin Durant. Maybe seven guys in the league can do that. But for everybody else, that\u2019s not a thing. You have to wait and see.\n\nOK, last question: It could be from the pros, college, some pickup game back in Saginaw. What is your absolute favorite memory of playing basketball? The one that gives you the purest, best feeling? 2015. Winning our first championship in Cleveland. Because it was a feeling I had never felt before, and it\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve never felt again. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. My biggest fear after we won the first championship was that I\u2019d never win again and never be able to experience that feeling again. I was right and wrong. I did win again, but I haven\u2019t experienced that feeling. I never take winning for granted, but it was never the same as that.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.\n\nDavid Marchese is a staff writer for the magazine and writes the Talk column.

            "section": "New York",
            "content": "The decision on Monday by a federal judge stemmed from a challenge by four gun-rights organizations and three New Jersey handgun owners.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe temporary order by Judge Ren\u00e9e Marie Bumb permits licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in nightclubs, theaters, arenas, racetracks and museums, among other places.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Monday that a central component of a new law that limited where handguns may be carried in New Jersey was unconstitutional, severely undercutting the state\u2019s effort to create gun-free zones in public places where crowds gather. In a sharply worded decision, Judge Ren\u00e9e Marie Bumb of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey concluded that a half-dozen restrictions in the legislation, adopted less than three weeks ago, were \u201cso extensive and burdensome\u201d that they rendered the right to \u201carmed self-defense in public a nullity.\u201d New Jersey, like New York, established an extensive list of places where handgun owners were not permitted to carry weapons in response to a Supreme Court ruling in June that loosened restrictions on carrying guns in public. Judge Bumb\u2019s order at least temporarily blocks New Jersey from enforcing much of the new law, and immediately permits licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in nightclubs, theaters, arenas, concert halls, racetracks and museums, among other places, pending further court action.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, noted that the ruling was not a final order and would be appealed. \u201cWe are disappointed by the court\u2019s ruling, which is inconsistent with the Second Amendment and will make New Jerseyans considerably less safe,\u201d Mr. Platkin said. \u201cBut this temporary order is just that: temporary.\u201d Judge Bumb\u2019s order also unraveled provisions in the New Jersey law that made it illegal to transport an unsecured, loaded handgun in a vehicle or carry one into any private establishment that had not posted signs explicitly stating that weapons were permitted. Her ruling was pointed, rejecting the state\u2019s claim that blocking portions of the law would \u201cshort-circuit the democratic process.\u201d \u201cThe state has had six months since Bruen to identify well-established and representative historical analogues,\u201d she wrote, referring to a standard set by Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court who wrote for the majority in a 6-to-3 decision. \u201cTheir dragging of feet is evidence that no such historical tradition and evidence exists,\u201d she added. She also wrote that the state had \u201cpresented no historical support to permit New Jersey to restrict concealed carry in bars and restaurants where alcohol is served.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Philip D. Murphy stressed that most elements of the law \u2014 including limits on who can obtain handgun licenses and new gun-safety training and insurance requirements \u2014 were not affected by the decision of a \u201cright-wing federal judge.\u201d \u201cWe are working closely with the attorney general\u2019s office to correct this errant decision and to ensure that the law will be reinstated in its entirety,\u201d the spokeswoman, Tyler Jones, said in a statement. The decision stemmed from a challenge by four gun-rights organizations \u2014 Second Amendment Foundation, Firearms Policy Coalition Inc., Coalition of New Jersey Firearm Owners and New Jersey Second Amendment Society \u2014 and three New Jersey handgun owners. \u201cClearly, New Jersey lawmakers have gone too far in crafting a law to get around the high court\u2019s decision,\u201d Alan M. Gottlieb, the executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, said in a statement. Laws in at least four other states \u2014 California, Hawaii, Maryland and Massachusetts \u2014 were also undermined by the Bruen ruling, sending legislators scrambling to adjust regulations to comport with the Supreme Court decision. Before New Jersey adopted its revised law, for example, applicants for so-called carry permits needed to demonstrate a justifiable need for a gun in public places, a policy that eliminated most people other than law enforcement officers. New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the nation, has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. In 2020, it also had the country\u2019s third-lowest rate of gun violence deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Hawaii had the lowest rate, and Massachusetts had the second-lowest level.)\n\nAn official with Everytown Law, an organization that works to stop gun violence, said she was confident that New Jersey\u2019s law would ultimately prevail. \u201cThis is far from being the end of this case,\u201d Janet Carter, senior director of appeals at Everytown Law, said in a statement. \u201cAnd we\u2019re ready to continue our fight to uphold lifesaving gun safety measures to keep everyone in New Jersey \u2014 and everyone in America \u2014 safe from gun violence.\u201d",

            "description": "The Florida governor is viewed as a top Republican presidential contender \u2014 at a time when the party is at a crossroads on foreign policy.",
            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is widely considered the strongest potential primary challenger to former President Donald Trump\u2019s third campaign in 2024. His national profile, developed during the Covid-19 pandemic and in battles over public education, is by definition domestic, and yet his experience as governor is an obvious precursor to the highest office. Especially if Mr. DeSantis runs in 2024, there is the real possibility that he will emerge as the new leader of the G.O.P. But there\u2019s one major presidential responsibility in which governors\u2019 records are often lacking, or at least little-known: foreign policy. Were he elected president, Mr. DeSantis would become America\u2019s top diplomat, commander in chief and maybe the Republican Party\u2019s direction-setter on foreign policy for years to come in Ukraine, Taiwan, Iran and beyond. How a prospective Republican presidential candidate views foreign policy feels like a question from a different era. For several years, the party\u2019s politics and understanding of its role at home and abroad have revolved first and foremost around Mr. Trump. But in the years since Mr. Trump became president, the G.O.P. coalition has split over America\u2019s role in the world, the causes and conflicts which deserve U.S. intervention and the value of international alliances. Before his current office, Mr. DeSantis represented Florida in the House of Representatives. There he served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired the Subcommittee on National Security, and built a foreign policy record. In many regards, it\u2019s a standard Republican record: critical of Pentagon waste but uninterested in reducing military spending, even to balance the budget; skeptical of unchecked foreign aid; reflexively supportive of Israel; willing to subvert civil liberties in the name of fighting terror; critical of U.S. military intervention in Syria under the Obama administration but supportive of it in the Trump years; and prone to framing relations with unreformed Soviet Bloc nations \u2014 Cuba, North Korea, and especially China \u2014 in absolutist, ideological terms.\n\nOn three key issues, however, Mr. DeSantis stands apart: his distance from Mr. Trump on Russia, his noticeable quiet on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq compared to Mr. Trump and other potential 2024 presidential candidates, and his fixation on Iran as a major threat to the United States. The aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine highlighted the first contrast with Mr. Trump. Where Mr. Trump responded by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201cgenius\u201d for invading, Mr. DeSantis decried the invasion as a Russian strategic blunder. Where Mr. Trump has long admired Mr. Putin as powerful and intelligent, Mr. DeSantis has dubbed him \u201can authoritarian gas station attendant.\u201d And where Mr. Trump notoriously accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Mr. DeSantis in 2013 saw \u201cPutin as somebody who\u2019s trying to confront the United States\u201d and last year included Russia on a short list of countries with \u201cnefarious intentions \u2026 to engage in espionage or influence operations\u201d in Florida. In 2015, Mr. DeSantis denounced President Barack Obama for \u201cpromoting foreign policy based on principle of leaving no dictator behind.\u201d Squint just a little and it\u2019s possible to see him finding his way to a similar line in a close primary race against Mr. Trump, though whether that could resonate with the MAGA base remains to be seen. (G.O.P. figures including the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator J.D. Vance have said the U.S. should curtail aid to Ukraine, and prominent right-wing commentators met the Washington visit of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine with vitriol.) On Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. DeSantis\u2019s position is murkier. His 78 statements in the congressional record over three terms in office are not especially enlightening on how he views the two biggest wars of the post-9/11 era. In one statement about the 10-year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, Mr. DeSantis, who himself was deployed to Iraq as a legal adviser in 2007, sidestepped debate about the war itself, and instead praised the troops. Discussing Syria in 2014, Mr. DeSantis said he disagreed with the idea that \u201cAmericans are war weary,\u201d and instead argued they were \u201cweary of missions launched without a coherent strategy and are sick of seeing engagements that produce inconclusive results rather than clear-cut victory.\u201d He has dropped a few hints of skepticism toward the conflicts started in the 2000s. Most explicitly, while criticizing President Biden\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, he acknowledged that \u201cthe whole Afghanistan thing \u2014 we needed to find a way to kind of dial that down, and I\u2019m in favor of that generally.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Mr. DeSantis\u2019s thin and even ambiguous record is the new norm for a Gen X candidate whose political career began well after the 2001 and 2003 invasions and whose presidential run would begin well after the wars\u2019 ends. But it raises the troubling possibility that Mr. DeSantis lacks wariness of military intervention and nation-building projects, which U.S. failures in Afghanistan and especially Iraq normalized even among Republicans in recent years. Determining that those generational wars weren\u2019t worth fighting was a formative political experience for many Americans, ordinary voters and politicians alike. Did Mr. DeSantis share in that lesson? That\u2019s not a purely academic question for a potential president, particularly one with Mr. DeSantis\u2019s record of hostility toward Iran. A frequent subject of his legislative sponsorships, Iran was one of his most favored topics in the congressional record, where he characterized Tehran as \u201can enemy of our country\u201d with whom we do not share any national interests. He made opposition to diplomacy with Iran a priority while in Congress, even urging Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal a year before the president did so. Mr. DeSantis\u2019s anti-Iran talk is within the normal range of Republican presidential candidates from the last two decades. Yet in concert with his record on Russia (Iran\u2019s partner in Syria, Ukraine and beyond) and with the open question of how he views the lessons of the post-9/11 wars, a President DeSantis might reprise that old G.O.P. ditty about bombing Iran. And beyond specific policy decisions, Mr. DeSantis would assume Republican leadership at an inflection point for the party\u2019s foreign policy. Iraq, Afghanistan and Mr. Trump\u2019s transformation of the G.O.P. \u2014 his repudiation of Bush-era neoconservatism and governance by golf buddy and inchoate Jacksonian impulses \u2014 left undone the Republican consensus on foreign affairs. The war in Ukraine has scrambled it further. Will the next Republican president be more or less likely than a Democratic rival to fight China over Taiwan? Would he or she withdraw the United States from NATO or settle in for a long-term proxy war with Russia? How will the post-Trump G.O.P. handle shifting relationships in the Middle East, international trade disputes and rising focus on the Indo-Pacific region? While most domestic policy battles are still drawn along familiar lines, the G.O.P.\u2019s foreign policy is in many senses a true unknown. Where the party lands in future decades could well be determined by its first effective post-Trump leader. That\u2019s a title Mr. DeSantis is presently favored to claim.",

            "content": "More than 7,000 nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center are striking over working conditions, calling for more nurses at the bedside for patients.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMore than 7,000 nurses at Mount Sinai Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center are seeking better wages and working conditions.\n\nHundreds of striking nurses and their supporters lined both sides of Madison Avenue in front of Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday, waving signs, blowing horns and calling for a labor contract that will require more nurses at the bedside for patients. The nurses, members of the New York State Nurses Association, went on strike at 6 a.m. Monday after talks with Mount Sinai management broke down in the early morning hours. Nurses also went out on strike at the three campuses of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx over similar issues of pay and staffing. Nurses at eight other city hospitals were able to reach tentative contract deals and did not strike. Monday\u2019s labor action, involving more than 7,000 nurses, represented the largest nursing strike in decades in New York City, and comes as nurses are increasingly turning toward walk outs as a labor strategy, both nationally and abroad. Nurses, who both saw how valued they were during the darkest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and who struggled with exhaustion and burnout, said they were standing their ground to improve conditions both for themselves and their patients. \u201cWe are not out here for wages, we are out here because we want patient safety,\u201d said Lorena Vivas, who has been a nurse for 19 years.\n\nMs. Vivas joined her fellow nurses, union leaders and local elected officials on the picket line in front of Mount Sinai, wearing bright red hats and scarves and shouting over the sounds of air horns and cheers. Letitia James, the state attorney general, and Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, were among the officials standing with the strikers. Ms. Vivas said she was often caring for three or four patients at a time in intensive care instead of the one or two she is supposed to. \u201cThis has been going on even before the pandemic,\u201d she added, \u201cand the pandemic just blew the whole thing open.\u201d The problem of understaffing at hospitals has been building for years, with nurses leaving emergency rooms and in-patient wards for higher paying jobs as temporary nurses or less stressful positions in outpatient settings. The Covid pandemic, which is now being accompanied by a surge in winter admissions of patients with flu and R.S.V., compounded the strain. At Mount Sinai, union leaders said, emergency room nurses can care for as many as 18 patients at a time. At Montefiore, patients are kept in hallways so often that management has installed televisions there, the union said. They said nurses will return only if the hospital agrees to improving working conditions. Hospital management says it is doing what it can given a national nursing shortage. \u201cThe challenges of hiring and growing a talented health care work force can\u2019t be overstated and were exacerbated by the pandemic,\u201d said Lucia Lee, a spokeswoman for Mount Sinai, explaining why there were hundreds of vacancies. She said the hospital had implemented \u201cunprecedented recruitment strategies\u201d in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to seamless and compassionate care, recognizing that the union leadership\u2019s decision will spark fear and uncertainty across our community,\u201d the statement said. Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse on the negotiating committee at Montefiore, said that the hospital had called nurses back to the negotiating table on Monday afternoon after seeing hundreds of nurses gathered outside the main campus on Monday morning.\n\u2022 None Apple: After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company will conduct an audit of its U.S. labor practices under an agreement with investors.\n\u2022 None N.Y.C. Nurses\u2019 Strike: Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan ended a three-day strike after the hospitals agreed to add staffing and improve working conditions.\n\u2022 None Amazon: A federal labor official A federal labor official rejected the company\u2019s attempt to overturn a union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island, removing a key obstacle to contract negotiations between the union and the company.\n\u2022 None Electric Vehicles: In a milestone for the sector, In a milestone for the sector, employees at an E.V. battery plant in Ohio voted to join the United Automobile Workers union, citing pay and safety issues as key reasons. Nurses on the picket line in the Bronx described overcrowded, understaffed conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s unsafe because, in the emergency room, how can a nurse safely monitor 20 patients?\u201d said Johnaira Dilone-Florian, a nurse practitioner. \u201cAnything can go wrong. We are human, we\u2019re not machines.\u201d Negotiations have been going on for four months, Ms Sheridan-Gonzalez said, but movement toward union demands of enforceable staffing ratios and recruitment bonuses to compete with higher pay at nearby NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital only happened in the last few days. \u201cI don\u2019t think they thought we were going to go out,\u201d she said. On Sunday night, Gov. Kathy Hochul called for binding arbitration \u201cso that all parties can swiftly reach a resolution.\u201d Officials from both hospitals said they would welcome arbitration and hoped the nurses\u2019 union would agree and postpone its strike deadline, but union officials did not accept the offer.\n\n\u201cGov. Hochul should listen to frontline Covid nurse heroes and respect our federally protected labor and collective bargaining rights,\u201d union officials said in a statement. The pandemic has left some frontline medical workers with deep distrust for management. In New York City, many nurses and doctors who worked through the first wave of the pandemic have not forgotten the conditions when Covid first swept through the city in early 2020, overwhelming hospitals with a surge of patients and killing more than 22,000 people. In Britain, nurses went on strike last month for the first time in the 74-year history of the country\u2019s National Health Service. Nancy Hagans, the president of the New York State Nurses Association, said hospitals\u2019 failure to hire new nurses has left hundreds of unfilled slots, including more than 700 openings at Montefiore and 500 at Mount Sinai. \u201cOur No. 1 issue is a crisis of staffing,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt is an issue that our employers have ignored.\u201d Nurses\u2019 contracts expired on Dec. 31 at a dozen private hospitals in the city, and the union authorized a strike at some of them and sent the hospitals a 10-day notice. On Sunday, two other Manhattan hospitals, both run by the Mount Sinai Health System \u2014 Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West, both on the West Side \u2014 reached a tentative settlement with the union, which included a 19.1 percent wage increase over three years. Hospital officials said they had made the same offer, which provided an additional $51,000 in cash compensation for each nurse and $19,500 in medical payment benefits over three years, to nurses at the Mount Sinai Hospital on Fifth Avenue. Union officials, however, said that there were still differences with seniority payments at Mount Sinai\u2019s main campus, and that nurses there tend to earn less than they do at the two other Mount Sinai campuses.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all New Yorkers to call 911 only for emergencies, and be prepared to seek an alternate facility in case their preferred hospital is impacted,\u201d he said. Mount Sinai officials said in a statement that their bargaining teams at three hospitals have met with the nurses\u2019 union more than 40 times since September. They added that a strike would \u201cplace even more strain on New York City\u2019s emergency departments and health systems during a time of crisis.\u201d One striking nurse outside Mount Sinai, John Adriel, 28, said that on the step-down floor where he tends to recovering patients, some on life support, he worries about their well-being and his own because there aren\u2019t enough nurses. \u201cThe patient-to-nurse ratios are unsafe,\u201d Mr. Adriel said. \u201cEvery time I go into work, truly I\u2019m scared for my license.\u201d Margit Anderegg, a labor and delivery nurse at Mount Sinai, said she was striking as a way to show solidarity with her colleagues in the emergency department, who she said sometimes have to care for 18 patients each. \u201cMount Sinai is trying to spin us like we are being greedy and abandoning our patients, but we can\u2019t work under those conditions, and it\u2019s been going on for years,\u201d she said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThis is Diary of a Spelling Bee Fanatic, a weekly review of the game that drives me out of my hivemind. In a good way. Sometimes. Read past Diary entries here, and join the daily discussion in the forum. Speaking of INFECTIVE \u2014 one of today\u2019s pangrams \u2014 I have finally recovered sufficiently from Covid-19 to attend group therapy. Far be it from me to give anyone financial advice, but I am going to buy stock in the company that makes Paxlovid. The chairs are placed relatively close together in our therapy sessions, so I decide to keep my mask on as a kindness to my fellow fanatics. Mrs. Needleman is already seated, as is Rhonda. I take a seat next to Rhonda, and we wait for our therapist. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d the therapist says. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy putting up \u2018Have you seen this man?\u2019 posters to see if someone has run into Peter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had a photograph of him for the poster?\u201d I ask. \u201cYes, I take a photo of everyone when they schedule their first appointment,\u201d the therapist says. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if people will be able to tell what he really looks like.\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop playing long enough to take his phone away from the front of his face,\u201d the therapist replies. The therapist somberly takes Peter\u2019s phone out of her purse and puts it on the chair next to her. \u201cI thought he might come back for it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t.\u201d I look over her shoulder and notice a figure at the door. It\u2019s Peter, and he looks a bit more disheveled than usual. \u201cI apologize for last week,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready to talk about my Spelling Bee habit.\u201d I notice that he has a twig in his hair.\n\n\u201cPeter,\u201d the therapist says, handing him the phone that he left with the group last Monday, \u201cwe were worried about you. Would you like to tell us what happened?\u201d A word that should have been accepted but wasn\u2019t: VINCITE: To provoke an oenophile by smelling a wine bottle\u2019s screw top. \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d my father says over the phone from Florida, \u201cwe have some party planned for tonight. We\u2019re going all out this time.\u201d Whenever there is a Yiddish or Judaism-related word in the game, my parents\u2019 entire building celebrates this \u201cnewfangled\u201d form of representation. I scan the Spelling Bee word list for the inspiration of tonight\u2019s senior-living extravaganza, but I don\u2019t see anything that would have gotten them excited. My mother gets on the phone. \u201cDidn\u2019t you spot the word RABBI? Why did we send you to Hebrew school for all those years?\u201d \u201cYou never sent me to Hebrew school,\u201d I say evenly. The closest thing my parents have to a hobby is revising family history. \u201cYou celebrated Passover by putting spare ribs on the Seder plate.\u201d \u201cRidiculous,\u201d my mother says, as she puts on her lipstick. \u201cYou got the best grades in your bat mitzvah class.\u201d \u201cNot only was I not bat mitzvahed but, years before that, you got us kicked out of a screening of \u2018The Ten Commandments\u2019 with Charlton Heston because you were laughing so hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey refunded our money,\u201d my mother says. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you still bring that up.\u201d \u201cIt was just during the burning bush scene,\u201d she says. \u201cC.G.I. back then wasn\u2019t what it is now.\u201d A word that should have been accepted but wasn\u2019t: TRIBUTATTY: Muddy and messy, like a riverbank after a storm. The hivemind\u2019s forum commentary appears to be evolving. Today\u2019s conversation is not so much about why certain words containing today\u2019s letters aren\u2019t accepted in the Bee, but, rather, why certain words that do not contain today\u2019s letters aren\u2019t accepted. This is new to me. \u201cRe yesterday\u2019s Bee, I just wanted to say that a fennec fox is a real animal, and that fennec is thus a real word,\u201d JanineinNJ writes. \u201cYesterday RAITA but not \u2018riata\u2019?\u201d Chans from San Diego says. Still, the same rules apply. No spoilers in the comments, or players will experience the wrath of Woodsider, a reader from New York City, who writes, \u201cMy New Year\u2019s resolution is to flag posts that contain spoilers.\u201d A word that should have been accepted but wasn\u2019t: VELVETO: To rule out the use of spreadable \u201ccheese product\u201d in a dish. Sam Ezersky, the Spelling Bee editor, and I have a tacit agreement: I don\u2019t complain about words that are not included in the game, and, in return, he does not block me on every communication format known to humanity. So far, things have worked out just FINE. Today, however, there is a glaring omission, in my opinion, so I send him a Slack message. \u201cHow come the word LUFF isn\u2019t allowed?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt seems to be a bone of contention on the forum.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many people know the technical word for the edge of a sail?\u201d Sam asks. \u201cMore than you would think, based on the comments,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd, apparently, it can also be used as a verb if you turn the head of your boat toward the wind.\u201d \u201cUse it in a sentence,\u201d Sam says. I\u2019m not a sailor, so I stop to think about it for a moment. \u201cJust \u2018luff\u2019 it on over here,\u201d I say weakly. \u201cNow you know why it\u2019s not accepted in the game,\u201d Sam says. Thankfully, he decides to change the subject. \u201cHow are your folks? Did they like the \u201crabbi\u201d in yesterday\u2019s puzzle?\u201d \u201cOh, they loved it,\u201d I say. \u201cThey danced the night away, and then the building managers had a screening of \u2018The Ten Commandments\u2019 for the tenants.\u201d \u201cThe Cecil B. DeMille movie?\u201d Sam asks. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother get thrown out of a theater over that?\u201d \u201cHow\u2019d she do this time?\u201d \u201cShe made it to the golden calf party scene,\u201d I say, \u201cbut it was too much for her. They had to ask her to leave.\u201d A word that should have been accepted but wasn\u2019t: GINFUNNELING: Using a kitchen tool to increase the rate of alcohol consumption.\n\nI am not a superstitious person, but I do allow myself a fairly strange indicator to tell me whether the day will be a good one, sort of like the Spelling Bee version of a Magic 8 Ball. If I immediately spot the pangram after I open the game, I feel as if everything is going to go my way. That is the case today, and, after I type in AXIOMATIC, I close the game and look forward to a peaceful day with no speed bumps. A few minutes later, I hear a knock at the door. I look out the window and realize that I\u2019m going to have to find a better medium for predicting the future. It\u2019s my neighbor, the one who used to steal my crossword puzzle, and he\u2019s holding his smartphone. This can mean only one thing. I open the door and greet him. A few pieces of glitter are still on his face from last week. \u201cAre you aware that the word \u2018flugel\u2019 was not accepted in yesterday\u2019s Spelling Bee?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou know, I played the flugelhorn in my school orchestra,\u201d my neighbor says, \u201cand I was very popular.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I see the connection,\u201d I reply. \u201cThe connection is that \u2018flugel\u2019 is a nickname for the flugelhorn,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone knows that, and it should be counted as correct in the game.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether everyone does know that,\u201d I say gently. I suddenly realize that I may have been better off when he was swiping the newspaper from my porch.",

Darius Pridgen reminded the congregants. \u201cYes, he was,\u201d a woman replied from the pews. From the church speakers came the smooth voice of the gospel singer William Becton: \u201cBe encouraged, no matter what\u2019s going on. He\u2019ll make it all right, but you gotta stay strong.\u201d Mr. Singer\u2019s friends and family swayed and clapped, raising their hands to the heavens. Western New York is awash in nearly unimaginable grief, preparing to bury more than 40 victims of a catastrophic Christmas-week blizzard, most of them in Buffalo. Families still struggling to understand how a region accustomed to fierce winter weather found itself so grievously unprepared will attend funeral upon funeral in the coming days, seeking solace among those who have suffered too.\n\nThe sorrow only intensified in the days after the storm. Five young children died in a house fire on New Year\u2019s Eve. Damar Hamlin, a football player for the Buffalo Bills, suffered a cardiac arrest also at the start of the new year. Black residents have been hit especially hard. In a community marked by segregation and poverty, more than half of the storm victims were Black, though Black residents account for only about 14 percent of Erie County\u2019s population. The disaster followed the massacre of 10 Black people at a Tops supermarket in east Buffalo at the hands of a racist gunman last spring. Many residents say the trauma from the shooting has not yet eased. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really got a chance to heal,\u201d said Vivian Robinson, a Christian pastor at Spirit of Truth Urban Ministry. \u201cWhen are we going to just have that moment to just breathe?\u201d\n\nBy now the stunning details of the December blizzard are well known: more than four feet of snow and blinding winds that persisted for days, stranding even rescue crews on unplowed roads as more than 1,000 emergency calls went unanswered in the early hours of the storm. But more than two weeks later, excruciating details continue to emerge. Mr. Singer had been on his way home, on foot, from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting at the height of the storm, his family believes. He got within a block of his house on Broadway but could walk no farther. \u201cChristmas will never be the same again,\u201d his son, Morris Singer III, said.\n\nMs. Robinson and her husband, Al, had welcomed those without power in their homes to ride out the storm at the east Buffalo church where they are pastors. Their invitation, posted on Facebook, quickly drew more than 130 desperate neighbors. \u201cThey were half frozen just trying to get here,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. Denise Sweet\u2019s family dodged the worst of the storm but won\u2019t soon forget the devastation. Days after the snow stopped falling, they drove around their neighborhood to scope out the damage. They spotted 10 cars draped in yellow and red tape, signifying which ones had bodies removed and which ones still had bodies inside. Her 14-year-old son, Simier, wondered if they had known any of the victims. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think too much about what snow could do to a person,\u201d he said. The roads in and around Buffalo are now cleared, the airport reopened, schools back in session. But residents, bound in their collective despair, are left to grapple with how to comfort and support those who lost family in the storm \u2014 a mission complicated by all the loss that came before. In Buffalo\u2019s Black community, especially, residents described the compounding impact of such relentless tragedy.\n\nMs. Sweet\u2019s stepfather died from Covid-19 last January. \u201cIt started right there and from that point on, month after month, it was just terrible,\u201d she said. Her family had a personal connection to one of the 10 victims of the shooting at the Tops grocery store, and they have been too fearful for their safety to return to the shop. Garnell Whitfield Jr., who lost his mother, Ruth Whitfield, in the massacre, said he still felt lost, six months on. \u201cThey took our elders,\u201d he said. Mr. Whitfield has tried to focus his energy on shining a light on how white supremacy contributed to his mother\u2019s death, as well as on the many problems he sees in his community. \u201cTwenty-four-seven, when there\u2019s not a big public thing going on, life here is very difficult for people that look like us,\u201d he said. LeCandice Durham had been in counseling since the shooting. An operator for the city\u2019s 311 service, she took calls during the storm from residents in dire situations.\n\nOn the morning of Mr. Singer\u2019s funeral, as family and friends celebrated his life inside the church, his mother, Elizabeth Singer, 89, watched a livestream from her nursing home. Mr. Singer was the last of Ms. Singer\u2019s five children alive. \u201cThis storm has taken her family,\u201d said Tamieka Johnson, Mr. Singer\u2019s niece. Mr. Singer\u2019s last sibling, a sister, died when she couldn\u2019t get treatment for an illness during the coronavirus lockdown, Ms. Johnson said. Community leaders are especially concerned about the well-being of the city\u2019s young people. \u201cThe threshold for a child in Buffalo to be rocked or shocked is higher than it would be for a suburban child,\u201d said Duncan Kirkwood, the co-chair of We the Parents, an advocacy group. \u201cBut once you meet that threshold,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have all this energy and anger, and you want to do something but you don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The school system has worked to address the social and emotional needs of children, in part by training staff to have more patience with their students. \u201cThis is not business as usual, these are not normal times,\u201d said Tonja Williams, the school district\u2019s superintendent. \u201cSometimes children don\u2019t cry with tears. Sometimes children cry by running around a building or knocking over a desk or using foul language.\u201d\n\nMany Black people could not afford to stock up on extra food before the blizzard, and as a result, risked driving or even walking out into the storm to get supplies for Christmas dinner, residents said. A 2021 study found that 11 percent of Black residents in Buffalo were unemployed, and 35 percent lived below the poverty line. And Black people on Buffalo\u2019s East Side who lost power were more likely to suffer more from the cold because many live in substandard homes that are poorly insulated, Mr. Taylor noted. Many in the community also said that they suspected the snow was cleared more swiftly in white suburbs than on the East Side, where some of the streets were already in disrepair before the storm. In the days after the storm, the county executive, too, criticized the speed of the cleanup in Buffalo. Mayor Brown defended the city\u2019s response. Mr. Pridgen, the pastor who is also president of the Buffalo Common Council, said city officials intended to investigate. \u201cAs with other things, I think we\u2019ll see that the East Side bore the brunt of the tragedy,\u201d said India Walton, who beat Mr. Brown in the Democratic primary for the mayoral seat last year, before losing to him in the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s not a priority,\u201d she said. At the funeral on Friday, Mr. Pridgen helped mourners remember and celebrate the life of Mr. Singer, who attended church regularly, sometimes sitting right behind Mr. Pridgen at the front of the hall. He acknowledged that the past year had tested the community\u2019s resilience. His congregation lost some of its \u201cstrongest members\u201d to the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Pridgen said afterward, and he had officiated at services for victims of the shooting. \u201cAlthough I mourn every death, these it\u2019s hard to make sense of sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my faith that has to bring me through, because the question is: Why them?\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nBritain\u2019s attempt to get into the space launch business on Monday night came up short when a 70-foot rocket stuffed with satellites failed to reach orbit, Virgin Orbit, the company providing the launch service, said. An hour after takeoff from an airstrip in Cornwall, in southwest England, a modified Boeing 747 released the rocket, which fired away as planned. It was supposed to take nine satellites up into low orbital positions 300 or more miles above the Earth. But Virgin Orbit said in a statement on Tuesday that the system had experienced an \u201canomaly\u201d while the rocket\u2019s second-stage engine was being fired. It had been traveling at more than 11,000 miles per hour when the mission ended prematurely. Dan Hart, the chief executive of Virgin Orbit, said in the statement that \u201cthe first-time nature\u201d of the mission had added layers of complexities, and that a \u201ctechnical failure\u201d appeared to have occurred. \u201cWe will work tirelessly to understand the nature of the failure, make corrective actions and return to orbit as soon as we have completed a full investigation and mission assurance process,\u201d he said. People in Britain\u2019s space industry said the goal \u2014 launching satellites from British soil for the first time \u2014 would have huge importance even though Virgin Orbit, which was founded by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, is a California company.\n\nThe ability to put satellites in space \u201cwill complete the picture for the U.K.,\u201d said Doug Liddle, the chief executive of In-Space Missions, a British satellite maker. Mr. Liddle spoke on Monday afternoon from a highway service area on his way to Cornwall, where two surveillance satellites made by his company, with funding from agencies of the British and U.S. militaries, would be loaded onto the Virgin Orbit rocket. British companies have for years manufactured satellites, only to have to rely on rockets in places like Cape Canaveral, Fla., or New Zealand to haul them into space. Having launch sites available in Britain \u201cmakes a huge difference in terms of being able to develop satellites and to fly them,\u201d said Emma Jones, head of U.K. business development for RHEA Group, a space security firm, which also has a satellite on the Virgin Orbit rocket. The launch would have been the first big payoff of an effort by the British government to bolster the country\u2019s space industry in the wake of Brexit, which has strained scientific and business ties with the European Union, the country\u2019s main trading partner. Work at Newquay Airport in Cornwall to make it ready to handle satellites cost about 20 million pounds, or $24 million, financed with government and private money, according to Melissa Thorpe, the head of Spaceport Cornwall. Ms. Thorpe said she expected launches to generate revenue by the fifth year of operation. While the current launch was delayed for around two months, Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit\u2019s chief executive, said Britain\u2019s effort seemed to have all the elements necessary to launch satellites. Virgin Orbit has already launched satellites from the United States and wants to establish itself as a company that can do so from anywhere a 747 can land.\n\n\u201cJust like in the U.S., it is a combination of commercial, civil and national security coming together that makes a space program or a space launch program successful,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Hart said the payload on the Virgin Orbit rocket, which included commercial satellites as well as devices sponsored by Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, was an \u201cexcellent model\u201d for the combined funding sources needed to sustain the expense of a full-service space program. Now that the British authorities have had a run-through on the regulatory and other work necessary for a space launch in densely populated Western Europe, the process should be smoother next time. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to work very closely with Portugal, with Spain and Ireland,\u201d because the Virgin plane \u201cwill fly through their controlled airspace,\u201d said Ian Annett, deputy chief executive of the U.K. Space Agency, which helped finance the launch. He said commercial airlines would have to reroute flights to stay out of the way. Working out such arrangements led to delays. \u201cClearly the first launch was an expensive undertaking,\u201d Mr. Hart said. Virgin Orbit had to keep its launch team in Britain since October, making the exercise far more costly than expected, although the company said precisely how much more would be hard to estimate. Virgin Orbit usually charges around $12 million for a launch, although the fees can vary. Britain already has a sizable satellite industry and has been one of the leaders in designing and making the shoebox-sized, relatively cheap devices that are becoming increasingly important for communications, surveillance and other purposes. The government expects that having the ability to send these satellites into orbit will give Britain a further edge. With modest funding, the government has encouraged receptive local authorities, like the one in Cornwall and others in Scotland, to develop sites suitable to have either vertical rocket launches or jumbo jets used as launch platforms.",

The package passed in a mostly party-line vote, with just one Republican voting no.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAfter initially balking at a package of changes to House rules that enshrine concessions the speaker made to ultraconservative members, Republicans united to push them through.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Monday pushed through an overhaul of operating rules for the new Congress, overcoming the concerns of some rank-and-file members about concessions that Speaker Kevin McCarthy made to the hard right last week in the desperate and drawn-out process of securing his job. Mr. McCarthy clinched the speaker\u2019s gavel early Saturday after a historic 15 rounds of voting that stretched across five days, and after giving in to a sweeping series of demands from the ultraconservative rebels who opposed him, including allowing any single lawmaker to call a snap vote to oust him. The struggle underscored how difficult it would be for him to corral his narrow majority, and in the hours before the vote on Monday, he was already confronting his first challenge, uncertain whether he would have the votes even to approve the rules that would allow the House to begin legislative business. In the end, a handful of holdouts dropped their opposition and supported the measure, putting aside reservations about Mr. McCarthy\u2019s concessions, including some that they worried could lead to deep cuts in military spending.\n\nTaken together, the rules increase transparency around how legislation is put together. But they could also make it difficult for the House to carry out even its most basic duties in the next two years, such as funding the government, including the military, or avoiding a catastrophic federal debt default. \u201cBills appear by dark of night; bills that nobody\u2019s read that are thousands of pages long,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority leader. \u201cToday starts that process \u2014 of fixing what\u2019s broken in Washington so that Washington can finally start working for the people of this country who are struggling.\u201d The 118th Congress is underway, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding the Senate.\n\u2022 None A Wide-Ranging Inquiry: The House approved the The House approved the creation of a committee to scrutinize what Republicans say is the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against conservatives.

Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, a Republican, was appointed as the state\u2019s next senator , replacing Ben Sasse, who resigned to become president of the University of Florida. Even as Republicans praised the legislation, the full extent of concessions Mr. McCarthy had made to appease the hard-right rebels was not yet fully known. Details were trickling out in the hours before the scheduled vote, and some lawmakers expressed doubt that they would ever know the entirety of what the speaker had privately promised. Many of the concessions \u2014 such as allowing the party\u2019s right wing a critical bloc of seats on the panel that decides which bills can be considered on the House floor and which amendments may be offered \u2014 were not included in the package that passed on Monday, but instead were approved in closed-door negotiations with a handshake agreement.\n\n\u201cSome sort of deal was hashed out for the majority of the 20 to vote for McCarthy for speaker, but this deal was crafted in private, behind closed doors,\u201d Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina wrote in a letter to her constituents on Monday. \u201cWe can\u2019t think of anything more \u2018swampy\u2019 than a member of Congress who tells the American people they\u2019re holding up the speaker vote because they\u2019re \u2018fighting\u2019 the \u2018swamp\u2019 only to broker some back-room deal, hidden away from the American people.\u201d Still, Ms. Mace, who had initially signaled she might oppose the rules package because she and other rank-and-file lawmakers had yet to be briefed on the full extent of Mr. McCarthy\u2019s concessions, supported the legislation after all. Democrats opposed the rules but said they were even more worried about what else the speaker had agreed to in exchange for crucial support. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not concerned about is not just what\u2019s written down here,\u201d Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said as he gestured at the rules package. \u201cI\u2019m concerned by the back-room deals that Speaker McCarthy made with the Freedom Caucus in exchange for their votes.\u201d The Democrats were joined by one Republican. Representative Tony Gonzales, Republican of Texas, opposed the legislation, citing concerns that Mr. McCarthy\u2019s agreement with the rebels on spending changes would lead to a significant cut to the nation\u2019s defense budget. That prospect was a \u201chorrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit Taiwan here in a couple of weeks,\u201d he said on CBS. \u201cHow am I going to look at our allies in the eye and say, \u2018I need you to increase your defense budget,\u2019 but yet America is going to decrease ours?\u201d But Mr. McCarthy\u2019s team successfully kept defections to a minimum. It was a preview of the task the speaker faces as he works to appease the far right while maintaining the backing of a much larger group of more mainstream conservatives to pass any legislation on the House floor, where he can afford less than a handful of defections.\n\nThe concessions enumerated in the rules measure included provisions that conservatives have sought for years in an effort to increase transparency around the legislative process, such as requiring that lawmakers receive the text of bills 72 hours ahead of a vote. It ends proxy voting, a procedure instituted by Democrats during the coronavirus pandemic. It also includes the stipulation that legislation must address a \u201csingle subject,\u201d in an attempt to discourage the introduction of sprawling legislation that mashes together numerous pieces of unrelated bills. \u201cKevin has given us so many changes to this institution that will outlast him \u2014 whether he lasts six years, two years, or six days into his speakership,\u201d Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky told Spectrum News. \u201cThese changes are fundamental.\u201d House Republicans also pushed through several changes to the way ethics investigations are handled, including setting up a process for the Ethics Committee to receive complaints directly from the public. Ethics watchdog groups have raised alarms about some of the changes, however, arguing the new rules package could hamper investigations by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which undertakes bipartisan inquiries and then makes recommendations for discipline to the Ethics Committee. One rule imposes term limits for board members, a move that would have the effect of removing all but one Democrat from the board at a time when it is considering whether to launch an inquiry into certain Republican congressmen over their conduct related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The rules also require the office to hire investigators within the first 30 days of a new Congress, a deadline ethics watchdogs say could be difficult to meet. Republicans countered that Democrats are free to replace those board members who will have to step down because of term limits, and they argue the new rules are meant to encourage the office to staff up quickly. They say there is nothing in the rules preventing the Office of Congressional Ethics from filling vacancies that occur throughout the year.",

The annual budget was $19,000. Cooper projected the films \u2014 sometimes herself \u2014 on a single 16-millimeter machine no larger than a microwave. \u201cI\u2019d say to someone, \u2018I show independent films,\u2019 and they\u2019d say, \u2018You mean pornography?\u2019\u201d Cooper, 74, recalled with a laugh in a recent conversation at the nonprofit art house cinema\u2019s offices, now located across the street from the theater in Greenwich Village. But now, Cooper, who has become synonymous with Film Forum \u2014 which has grown into a four-screen space with a $6 million-a-year budget and an influence that reaches far beyond New York City \u2014 is stepping down from the director role she\u2019s filled for half a century, the organization announced on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this for years,\u201d said Cooper, whose last day will be June 30, though she will remain on staff as an adviser. \u201cI wanted to have a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nSucceeding her will be Sonya Chung, 49, the theater\u2019s deputy director, who began working at Film Forum in 2003 as the director of development. Chung, who has a master\u2019s degree in fiction writing from the University of Washington, in Seattle, left in 2007 to write and publish two novels (she also taught literature and writing for three years at Columbia University and for nine years at Skidmore College, both in New York). She returned in 2018 as a programming consultant and a member of the advisory committee, and was hired as deputy director in February 2020.

Cooper was a newly minted 23-year-old Smith College graduate when she took over the theater founded by two film buffs, Peter Feinstein and Sandy Miller, in 1970. Over her 50-year tenure, she built a beloved cultural institution that has introduced the work of now-prominent filmmakers to American audiences, earning the affection of critics and patrons alike. She has led the theater through three relocations \u2014 Film Forum moved to its current space on West Houston Street in 1989 \u2014 and oversaw a $5 million expansion and renovation in 2018 that upgraded the seating, legroom and sightlines in all screening rooms and added a fourth, which increased the venue\u2019s capacity to nearly 500 seats. Cooper said she was most proud of working to broaden the scope of Film Forum\u2019s programming, introducing audiences to major German filmmakers of the 1970s like Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. She was also honored to have programmed the New York premieres of ambitious documentaries such as \u201cAsylum,\u201d Peter Robinson\u2019s 1972 look inside the psychiatrist R.D. Laing\u2019s therapeutic community of people with schizophrenia living together in a group home in London; and Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cFour Little Girls\u201d (1997), about the children killed in the 1963 bombing of a church in Birmingham, Ala. It\u2019s the meticulously curated slate of new films \u2014 which Cooper, Chung and the artistic director Mike Maggiore map out on a dry erase board in the cinema\u2019s offices as far as six months in advance \u2014 that serves as part of the draw for Film Forum\u2019s approximately 200,000 visitors each year, along with a robust lineup of classic films programmed by the repertory artistic director Bruce Goldstein, a concession stand menu of decadent baked goods and a robust lineup of talkbacks with filmmakers. Chung says the biggest challenge facing Film Forum, which is one of the few theaters regularly to feature independent movies in New York, is competition from streaming services. It can be tough, she said, to convince people who\u2019ve become used to watching at home to bundle up, take the subway to the theater and pay $15 for a night out. One solution, she said, is creating a memorable experience that people can\u2019t get anywhere else. They recently hosted Q. and A. events with the filmmaker Lizzie Gottlieb, who directed the documentary \u201cTurn Every Page \u2014 The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb,\u201d and the film\u2019s subject, the book editor and her father Robert Gottlieb; as well as with the Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, whose dark tale about the life of a donkey, \u201cEO,\u201d has been shortlisted for an Academy Award.

And now, starting this month, the theater\u2019s internship program \u2014 which places three college students each semester in roles in the theater\u2019s repertory program, outreach and administration departments \u2014 will be paid. \u201cWe decided we should pay them in order to attract a more diverse group of young people to be able to work here,\u201d Chung said. As for Cooper, a longtime resident of the far West Village who walks to work each day, she will remain an active member of the organization\u2019s programming team. She\u2019ll continue to represent Film Forum at the Berlin and Amsterdam film festivals. She intends to maintain her schedule of watching at least 500 films per year. She\u2019ll continue to focus on fund-raising for the nonprofit, which raises approximately $3 million of its operating budget each year. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d stay here 50 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut where would I go?

Over her 50-year tenure, she built a beloved cultural institution that has introduced the work of now-prominent filmmakers to American audiences, earning the affection of critics and patrons alike. She has led the theater through three relocations \u2014 Film Forum moved to its current space on West Houston Street in 1989 \u2014 and oversaw a $5 million expansion and renovation in 2018 that upgraded the seating, legroom and sightlines in all screening rooms and added a fourth, which increased the venue\u2019s capacity to nearly 500 seats.\n\nCooper said she was most proud of working to broaden the scope of Film Forum\u2019s programming, introducing audiences to major German filmmakers of the 1970s like Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. She was also honored to have programmed the New York premieres of ambitious documentaries such as \u201cAsylum,\u201d Peter Robinson\u2019s 1972 look inside the psychiatrist R.D. Laing\u2019s therapeutic community of people with schizophrenia living together in a group home in London; and Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cFour Little Girls\u201d (1997), about the children killed in the 1963 bombing of a church in Birmingham, Ala. It\u2019s the meticulously curated slate of new films \u2014 which Cooper, Chung and the artistic director Mike Maggiore map out on a dry erase board in the cinema\u2019s offices as far as six months in advance \u2014 that serves as part of the draw for Film Forum\u2019s approximately 200,000 visitors each year, along with a robust lineup of classic films programmed by the repertory artistic director Bruce Goldstein, a concession stand menu of decadent baked goods and a robust lineup of talkbacks with filmmakers. Chung says the biggest challenge facing Film Forum, which is one of the few theaters regularly to feature independent movies in New York, is competition from streaming services. It can be tough, she said, to convince people who\u2019ve become used to watching at home to bundle up, take the subway to the theater and pay $15 for a night out. One solution, she said, is creating a memorable experience that people can\u2019t get anywhere else. They recently hosted Q. and A. events with the filmmaker Lizzie Gottlieb, who directed the documentary \u201cTurn Every Page \u2014 The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb,\u201d and the film\u2019s subject, the book editor and her father Robert Gottlieb; as well as with the Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, whose dark tale about the life of a donkey, \u201cEO,\u201d has been shortlisted for an Academy Award.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe self-exiled royal has given the world a warts-and-all look at his family \u2014 with an emphasis on the warts.\n\nLONDON \u2014 King Charles III has long pushed the idea of slimming down the British royal family. If his younger son\u2019s unsparing new book is any indication, he has achieved his goal, though not in the way he intended. The publication of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir on Tuesday \u2014 with its scorched-earth details about his rupture with his family \u2014 seems likely to dash any near-term prospects that Harry will return to the fold by reconciling with his father; with Camilla, the queen consort; or with his older brother, Prince William. The book, titled \u201cSpare,\u201d paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor. Far from the smooth-running operation known as The Firm, it comes across as a collection of warring fiefs, where family members jockey for advantage with a complicit tabloid press, trying to buff their images by dishing dirt on one another. With Harry and his wife, Meghan, estranged and living in Southern California; the king\u2019s disgraced younger brother, Andrew, in internal exile following his settlement of a sexual assault lawsuit; and the death of Queen Elizabeth II last September, the family\u2019s senior ranks have dwindled to a handful of figures.\n\nEven those who remain are caught in a poisonous public-relations contest that pits family members against one another, according to Harry. He writes that an aide to his father and stepmother planted negative stories in the London newspapers about William and his wife, Catherine \u2014 a practice that he said also tormented him and Meghan and contributed to their decision to leave. \u201cI was displeased about being used this way, and livid about it being done to Meg,\u201d Harry said in the book, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cBut I had to admit it was happening much more often lately to Willy. And he was justifiably incandescent about it.\u201d Buckingham Palace has stuck to its policy of not commenting on the book or on the cavalcade of television interviews Harry has done to promote it. But as the disclosures reach a clattering peak this week, royal experts predicted Charles and William would have to reach some kind of accommodation with Harry, if only to prevent the rift from overshadowing the king\u2019s coronation in May. The Harry-and-Meghan drama, several royal experts said, has become the gravest crisis confronting the monarchy since the fraught aftermath of the death of Harry\u2019s mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales, in a car crash in the late summer of 1997, when the queen came under rare criticism for not showing enough sympathy.\n\nThe palace has signaled that Harry and Meghan might be invited to the coronation, suggesting that Charles still hopes to play a healing role. But in an interview Sunday with an ITV correspondent, Tom Bradby, Harry was noncommittal about attending. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that can happen between now and then,\u201d he said. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

Here\u2019s a look at Dysfunction and disorder are hardly restricted to the House of Windsor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies So much has already happened that it is hard to imagine Harry in dress uniform, marching to Westminster Abbey with his father and brother. \u201cThis seems unsustainable,\u201d said Ed Owens, a historian who has written about the relations between the monarchy and news media. \u201cIt suggests an institutional failure, and a complete contradiction to how historians think of The Firm as always working together. They\u2019re just as often at odds with each other.\u201d Mr. Owens said William, one of the most popular royals, had been particularly damaged by the book. Harry, the \u201cspare\u201d to William\u2019s heir, portrays his elder brother as ill-tempered, entitled and prone to violence, knocking Harry to the floor in one altercation and grabbing his shirt in another. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to get a grip on how they deal with Harry,\u201d Mr. Owens said. The latest drip of disclosures began last week with teasers for a promotional TV interview Harry did with ITV and another with the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d It accelerated after the book, published by Penguin Random House, leaked out nearly a week before its publication date, first in The Guardian and later in other papers after it was mistakenly put on sale in Spain. The Times obtained its copy in London.\n\nFor days, nuggets from the book have been splashed across front pages. \u201cOutrageous boast,\u201d The Daily Mirror said Saturday of Harry\u2019s claim that he had killed 25 Taliban fighters as a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. \u201cWills lunge at me after Philip\u2019s funeral,\u201d The Sun said on Sunday, referring to Harry\u2019s account of a tense meeting with his brother after they buried Prince Philip, their grandfather, in 2021. On Monday, after the TV interviews, the tabloids played up the claim that Harry had walked back one of the most explosive accusations made by him and Meghan in their interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021: that a member of the royal family had spoken in racist terms about their unborn child. The episode is not mentioned in \u201cSpare,\u201d which is curious since Harry skips little else, from his recreational drug use to how he lost his virginity in a field behind a pub. Speaking to Mr. Bradby, Harry did not retract the couple\u2019s claim that a family member had speculated anxiously about the skin color of the child. But he said it was an example of \u201cunconscious bias\u201d rather than racism. Questions of racism reverberated for weeks after Ms. Winfrey\u2019s interview, forcing William to deny that the royal family was racist. They resurfaced again recently when a former lady-in-waiting to the queen, Susan Hussey, was stripped of her duties and forced to apologize after subjecting a Black British guest at Buckingham Palace to insistent questioning about where her family came from. For a few royal watchers, Harry\u2019s decision not to reprise those accusations left the door open for some sort of peacemaking.\n\nThe risk, he said, is that Harry\u2019s unfiltered details will rob the royal family of its mystique with the public. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to have that mystery when we know they fight and call each other names,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. If Harry tried to ease the pressure on the family concerning race, he most likely complicated matters with his stepmother. He and his brother, he writes, pleaded with their father not to marry Camilla after the death of their mother, though they did not begrudge him the relationship. And he claimed that Camilla was behind several negative stories he said were planted with London papers. \u201cWith a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that,\u201d Harry said to Anderson Cooper on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d In the book, Harry claims that this betrayal dated all the way to when he was a high school student at Eton College. A tabloid editor, whom he does not name, called the palace with what she said was evidence that Harry was using drugs. Harry denied it and, he writes, he hoped his father would back him. Instead, on the advice of a communications aide to Charles and Camilla, the palace decided to cooperate with the story. \u201cAmid all this unpleasantness, all this extortion and gamesmanship, the spin doctor had discovered one silver lining, one shiny consolation prize for Pa,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cNo more the unfaithful husband, Pa would now be presented to the world as the harried single dad coping with a drug-addled child.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA year after the Twin Parks blaze that killed 17, a former resident plans to go back to pay homage to those who lost their lives.\n\nKaren Dejesus said she would go back for the first time in almost a year, back to the building where she spent a third of her life. The building where a space heater in an apartment down the hall sparked a fire with thick, choking smoke that spread through the stairwells, killing 17 people. \u201cI can\u2019t say I will ever get over that,\u201d she told me after using words like \u201ctragedy,\u201d \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and \u201cunimaginable\u201d to describe the conflagration at the 19-story Twin Parks North West building a year ago. \u201cPeople I knew lost their lives. I saw them every day \u2014 children. Those of us that are still here have to go back and pay homage.\u201d\n\nOn the first anniversary of the fire, there will be remembrances at the building, long a homeland-in-exile for West Africans who had moved to New York. My colleague Jeffery C. Mays writes that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing a national plan to address \u201cAmerica\u2019s fire problem.\u201d Under federal legislation that President Biden signed into law last month, the United States Fire Administration, a unit of FEMA, will have the power to identify the causes of fires like the one at Twin Parks. The agency can also identify buildings with similar problems and make recommendations. The fire underscored how lower-income and immigrant communities are disproportionately exposed to the dangers of fire. A New York Times investigation found that the deaths were preventable: No one died from the fire itself. Investigators believe the building became a chimney of smoke that spread to the upper floors because of faulty self-closing doors. Like many apartment buildings in New York, Twin Parks North West lacked potentially lifesaving systems like sprinklers. Legislation passed in 1992 \u2014 20 years after the Twin Parks tower opened \u2014 mandates them in new multifamily buildings. But the Fire Administration says that roughly 570,000 multifamily public housing units that predate the 1992 law are still occupied, and a \u201csignificant portion\u201d do not have sprinklers. The fire agency also says that the chance of dying in a fire in the United States is higher than it was 40 years ago.\n\nAlso troubling is the increase in fires caused by lithium-ion batteries, particularly for e-bikes. New York City Fire officials reported that in the first 11 months of 2022, battery fires had killed six people and injured 140 others, and that there were 87 more lithium-ion battery fires than in all of 2021. The Daily News reported last month that fire officials had discovered an e-bike battery in the apartment where the Twin Parks fire started. It added to the smoke, the paper said. The Fire Administration\u2019s new investigatory powers will not be retroactive, so it will not look into the Twin Parks fire. But other communities will benefit from the concerns that surfaced with the fire, said Daniel Madrzykowski, director of research for the UL Fire Safety Research Institute. He said local investigators often concentrate on finding the cause of a fire. The federal government, he said, can focus on why a fire was so deadly. Dejesus said that sounded like a good idea. \u201cYeah, the government has some need to investigate, so another fire doesn\u2019t occur,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I know the tragedy.\u201d But Dejesus, who moved out because her floor was \u201cuninhabitable\u201d and now lives in another building in the South Bronx, wondered if the new federal provisions were enough. \u201cWe have fire marshals and things,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe someone from one of these places can come out every other month and walk the building. What is it going to take, an hour, an hour and a half of their time, start at the top and walk down.\u201d And, she said, \u201cmake sure if they open the door, the door is automatically going to shut back.\u201d \u201cI know that a lot of the doors didn\u2019t close while we were living there,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe unit that I lived in, on a good day, the door may have closed behind us \u2014 or it may not. I feel that the inspectors, they need to have more inspectors, and they need to be more diligent about people\u2019s lives. We live below poverty level. That doesn\u2019t mean that our lives are not valuable.\u201d\n\nMy colleagues Hurubie Meko and Lola Fadulu write that the roads in and around Buffalo have been plowed and schools are open again. But people are still bound in collective despair, left to figure out how to support neighbors and friends who lost relatives in the storm. Some froze to death in their cars or houses, or on snow-clogged sidewalks that they could not navigate. Some died when emergency medical services were delayed. One man was poisoned by carbon monoxide that built up in his home. A 3-year-old girl drowned in the swimming pool of a hotel where her family had taken refuge. A victim\u2019s body was found in a tent. The new year has been no easier emotionally. It began with the news that five young children had died in a house fire on New Year\u2019s Eve. Then Damar Hamlin of the Buffalo Bills collapsed and went into cardiac arrest on the field during a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game in Cincinnati. In the Buffalo area, the storm was particularly hard on Black residents. More than half of the storm victims were Black, though Black residents account for only about 14 percent of the population in Erie County, which includes Buffalo. The storm followed the massacre of 10 Black people at a supermarket in East Buffalo at the hands of a racist gunman last spring. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really got a chance to heal,\u201d said Vivian Robinson, a Christian pastor at Spirit of Truth Urban Ministry. \u201cWhen are we going to just have that moment to just breathe?\u201d",

Una ma\u00f1ana reciente, unos bidones de 208 litros llenos de productos qu\u00edmicos fabricados en Ohio esperaban los camiones que los transportar\u00edan al otro lado del r\u00edo Bravo, para ser utilizados como materia prima en una f\u00e1brica de pintura de la ciudad industrial mexicana de Monterrey. Las pastillas de freno fabricadas en M\u00e9xico se dirig\u00edan hacia el norte, a empresas de transporte localizadas en regiones tan lejanas como Dakota del Sur. Cuanto m\u00e1s se expande el comercio, mayores son las oportunidades para Laredo, una ciudad en expansi\u00f3n de m\u00e1s de 250.000 habitantes que durante mucho tiempo ha sido el puerto terrestre dominante en la serpenteante frontera entre Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. Ahora, est\u00e1 a punto de convertirse en un componente m\u00e1s vital de la econom\u00eda mundial. Las empresas estadounidenses, que aprendieron de los problemas en la cadena de suministro derivados de la pandemia y alarmadas por la animadversi\u00f3n entre Estados Unidos y China, optaron por reducir su dependencia de las f\u00e1bricas situadas al otro lado del Pac\u00edfico y han comenzado a trasladar la producci\u00f3n a M\u00e9xico.\n\nA diario, Laredo ya recibe unos 800 millones de d\u00f3lares en productos, desde autopartes hasta ropa y aguacates. Esta realidad se hace evidente en el desfile de camiones que esperan, a menudo durante horas, su oportunidad de cruzar el puente que atraviesa el r\u00edo Bravo, el turbio caudal que divide Texas de M\u00e9xico. Todo indica que hay m\u00e1s mercanc\u00edas en camino, lo que supone una oportunidad monumental para los agentes aduaneros, los transportistas y las empresas de transporte. \u201cAqu\u00ed todo crece: un 10, 20, 30 por ciento cada a\u00f1o\u201d, afirma Pablo Garza, de 30 a\u00f1os, responsable de planeaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica de Akzent Logistics, que posee dos almacenes en Laredo y est\u00e1 a punto de terminar la construcci\u00f3n de un tercero. \u201cEs una ciudad ajetreada. Es asombrosa la cantidad de mercanc\u00edas que se mueven en la ciudad\u201d.\n\nDurante un acto celebrado en el ayuntamiento el mes pasado, las autoridades locales celebraron un hito: los datos revelan que, en octubre, Laredo registr\u00f3 un movimiento de mercanc\u00edas valoradas en 27.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, cifra que supera el flujo registrado en los puertos oce\u00e1nicos gemelos de Los \u00c1ngeles y Long Beach, California, principal puerta de entrada de las importaciones estadounidenses. Los puertos del sur de California crecieron de manera exponencial durante la era de la globalizaci\u00f3n centrada en China. Laredo parece estar preparada para asumir un papel similar en la pr\u00f3xima fase de la globalizaci\u00f3n, centrada en las cadenas de suministro regionales, en la que las empresas estadounidenses depender\u00e1n m\u00e1s de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica. Sin embargo, la euforia se ti\u00f1e de ansiedad cuando las empresas y las autoridades municipales temen que la infraestructura existente (un par de puentes comerciales que cruzan el r\u00edo Bravo, carreteras atascadas por el tr\u00e1fico y un mont\u00f3n de bodegas) se vea desbordada por la afluencia de mercanc\u00edas. \u201cTenemos que adelantarnos a este tsunami que se avecina\u201d, dijo Pete S\u00e1enz, quien fue alcalde de Laredo. \u201cAhora estamos rezagados\u201d. Se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo una enorme construcci\u00f3n. Al norte de la ciudad, un ej\u00e9rcito de excavadoras desgarra la p\u00e1lida tierra, convirtiendo ranchos salpicados de cactus en parques industriales, bodegas y dep\u00f3sitos de camiones a ambos lados de la interestatal 35, la autopista que une M\u00e9xico con la secci\u00f3n central de Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1. En Laredo se est\u00e1n construyendo unos 185.806 metros cuadrados de bodegas, seg\u00fan Prologis, una empresa de inversi\u00f3n inmobiliaria. Esto supone un aumento del 5 por ciento del espacio disponible.\n\nPero con los almacenes ocupados en m\u00e1s de un 98 por ciento, las nuevas instalaciones podr\u00edan saturarse con rapidez. \u201cNo cabe duda de que Laredo tiene un problema de espacio\u201d, afirma Garza. Los almacenes \u201cest\u00e1n llenos. Seguido tenemos que rechazar a los clientes\u201d. Las mercanc\u00edas que se comercializaron entre Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico en 2021 superaron los 660.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, un aumento de casi una quinta parte respecto al a\u00f1o anterior, seg\u00fan datos del censo estadounidense. El comercio se expandi\u00f3 a un ritmo similar el a\u00f1o pasado, seg\u00fan los datos disponibles. A la urgencia se suma la hip\u00f3tesis generalizada de que esto no es m\u00e1s que el principio de lo que podr\u00edan ser d\u00e9cadas de crecimiento del comercio entre los dos pa\u00edses vecinos, a medida que los minoristas estadounidenses buscan proveedores en el mismo hemisferio que sus clientes.\n\nHace cuatro a\u00f1os, el Departamento de Transporte de Estados Unidos pronostic\u00f3 un fuerte aumento del paso de camiones por Laredo, que solo en direcci\u00f3n sur alcanzar\u00eda los 9800 cruces fronterizos en 2025. El tr\u00e1fico alcanz\u00f3 ese nivel a finales de 2021, cuatro a\u00f1os antes de lo previsto. \u201cSuper\u00f3 todas las proyecciones\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Glafiro Montemayor, presidente de Gemco, otra empresa de transporte de mercanc\u00edas con sede en Laredo. Se\u00f1al\u00f3 que las mercanc\u00edas que cruzan la frontera se han m\u00e1s que duplicado desde 2000 sin que se hayan a\u00f1adido grandes infraestructuras. \u201cLaredo est\u00e1 lleno de camiones\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo vamos a gestionarlo?\u201d. Montemayor est\u00e1 recaudando fondos para un proyecto que se presenta como la respuesta a esa pregunta: un puente de 360 millones de d\u00f3lares que cruce el r\u00edo Bravo al sur de Laredo. El proceso aduanero ser\u00eda gestionado conjuntamente por las autoridades estadounidenses y mexicanas, lo que supondr\u00eda una inspecci\u00f3n \u00fanica. Esto permitir\u00eda que los camiones crucen en 30 minutos. Montemayor declar\u00f3 que el gobierno mexicano ya aprob\u00f3, en tanto que el Departamento de Estado estadounidense est\u00e1 a punto de concluir su propia revisi\u00f3n. Su plan es el pilar de un centro log\u00edstico que podr\u00eda ofrecer una alternativa a la excesiva dependencia de grandes puertos como Los \u00c1ngeles, escenario de tortuosos atascos flotantes durante los peores meses de la pandemia.\n\nCasi dos tercios de los contenedores que llegan a los puertos oce\u00e1nicos de la costa oeste de Estados Unidos tienen como destino el centro del pa\u00eds y la costa este, regiones a las que se llega m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente por ferrocarril y cami\u00f3n desde Laredo, explic\u00f3 Montemayor. Algunas empresas estadounidenses que importan mercanc\u00edas de Asia ya est\u00e1n evitando los muelles del sur de California y enviandolas los cargamentos a Manzanillo, en la costa mexicana del Pac\u00edfico. Desde all\u00ed, trasladan los contenedores hacia el norte, a Laredo, con destino a toda Norteam\u00e9rica. Kansas City Southern, el gigante ferroviario, recoge los contenedores procedentes de Asia en el puerto de L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, en el estado mexicano de Michoac\u00e1n, y los transporta hacia el norte. La empresa acaba de poner la primera piedra de un proyecto de 100 millones de d\u00f3lares que duplica la capacidad de un puente ferroviario sobre el r\u00edo Bravo. Al mismo tiempo, las autoridades mexicanas est\u00e1n haciendo sus propios planes para facilitar el flujo de mercanc\u00edas a trav\u00e9s de la frontera. En el acto del Ayuntamiento, el alcalde S\u00e1enz conoci\u00f3 a funcionarios del estado mexicano de Nuevo Le\u00f3n, ubicado al otro lado del r\u00edo . All\u00ed, un joven gobernador con mentalidad de desarrollo, Samuel Garc\u00eda, promete mejorar las carreteras que unen Monterrey con la frontera como parte de una serie de medidas agresivas para captar la inversi\u00f3n extranjera.\n\nEl proyecto de carretera busca aumentar el atractivo del cruce del r\u00edo Bravo por el puente Colombia, que en este momento no se usa mucho, y que est\u00e1 ubicado a 40 minutos en auto desde los almacenes y centros de distribuci\u00f3n en Laredo. M\u00e1s del 80 por ciento del tr\u00e1fico transfronterizo de camiones opta por el Puente Internacional Comercio Mundial que es mucho m\u00e1s cercano. Debido a la gran congesti\u00f3n en las carreteras que conducen al puente Comercio Mundial, Nuevo Le\u00f3n est\u00e1 apostando a que puede atraer m\u00e1s tr\u00e1fico al cruce del puente Colombia facilitando el paso de ese tramo a Monterrey. Se espera que Tesla anuncie planes para ubicar una nueva planta de veh\u00edculos el\u00e9ctricos dentro de ese estado mexicano, enviando veh\u00edculos completos hacia Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1. Lego opera su f\u00e1brica m\u00e1s grande en Nuevo Le\u00f3n, y usa el puente Colombia para enviar los productos terminados directamente a los almacenes en Texas. En Laredo, los intereses empresariales y las autoridades locales acusan a las autoridades estatales y federales de poner en peligro las oportunidades de la regi\u00f3n al retener los fondos necesarios para ampliar el sistema de autopistas circundante.\n\nEn una ma\u00f1ana reciente, cajas de pl\u00e1stico anaranjadas con sellos de puertas de autom\u00f3viles fabricadas en Alabama estaban dispuestas sobre las tarimas de madera, de camino a una planta de ensamblaje en M\u00e9xico. Las piezas de transmisi\u00f3n producidas en Illinois y dirigidas a una f\u00e1brica en Monterrey estaban apiladas debajo de una tarjeta blanca con la palabra como \u201cExpedited\u201d (t\u00e9rmino usado para designar a las entregas urgentes). \u201cSaldr\u00e1n al final del d\u00eda\u201d, dijo Garza. \u201c\u2018Urgente\u2019 es una palabra muy com\u00fan por aqu\u00ed\u201d. Garza, un pensador progresista cuyo \u00fanico hijo todav\u00eda es un beb\u00e9, describe con confianza sus planes para tener tres hijos m\u00e1s. Y proyecta el mismo estado de \u00e1nimo al inspeccionar la zona ubicada a 6,4 kil\u00f3metros de la interestatal, en busca de un terreno vac\u00edo que su empresa pueda comprar y convertir en m\u00e1s almacenes. \u201cAhora tenemos que comprar terrenos, para poder construir despu\u00e9s\u201d, dijo.

That year, the team selected Kyler Murray with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. The two men helped the team build into a playoff team last season. But the Cardinals came crashing to earth in 2022, with Murray and Kingsbury butting heads on the sideline and the team losing its final seven games of the season.\n\nKingsbury had agreed to a contract extension to 2027 in March. The job was his first in the N.F.L. after he found success as a head coach at Texas Tech. He finished with a 28-37-1 record in Arizona.\n\nGeneral Manager Steve Keim departed the Cardinals for health reasons, the team said.\n\nLovie Smith of the Houston Texans on Sunday was the first N.F.L. coach to be dismissed at the end of the regular season after the team limped to a 3-13-1 record, ending with a 32-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nSmith was the second successive Texans head coach to be fired after just one season. The team fired David Culley a year ago, after a 4-13 season. Bill O\u2019Brien, who coached the Texans from 2014 to 2020, was fired after leading the team to four playoff appearances.",

            "description": "This weekend the narrative around the Buffalo Bills player flipped, from soul-searching about the violence of America\u2019s most popular sport to something more hopeful.",
            "section": "Arts",
            "content": "This weekend the narrative around the Buffalo Bills player flipped, from soul-searching about the violence of America\u2019s most popular sport to something more hopeful.\n\nLast week came the horror of watching Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills safety, suffer cardiac arrest live on television, followed by days of national soul-searching about the violence of America\u2019s most popular sport. This weekend, the narrative flipped. On Saturday night, before the Tennessee Titans and the Jacksonville Jaguars faced off for a division title and a trip to the playoffs, both teams gathered at midfield, then knelt and prayed together. Sunday afternoon, on the usually macho CBS pregame show, Boomer Esiason confessed his love for each of the other panelists individually, which prompted Nate Burleson, another former player, to say, \u201cLove you, too, brother.\u201d Before the opening kickoff of Sunday\u2019s game pitting the Bills against the New England Patriots, Jim Nantz, the first-string play-by-play announcer for CBS, then delivered the N.F.L.\u2019s message: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve really seen this week is a glimpse of humanity at its very best.\u201d Nantz\u2019s partner in the broadcasting booth, Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, underscored the point. \u201cPeople came together and put their differences aside,\u201d he said. What started as a tragedy, he added, \u201chas slowly turned into a celebration of life.\u201d So what\u2019s the ultimate takeaway? If Hamlin weren\u2019t making a remarkable recovery, off his breathing tube, talking, tweeting and neurologically intact, it would probably be different. There would still be the outpouring of public good wishes but not the joy or shared pride and sense of common purpose. Like the movies and other forms of popular culture, football is a national barometer, after all. And the last week seems to have illuminated the country\u2019s erratic condition \u2014 the violence but also the longing, or at least the posture of longing, for unity in polarizing times.\n\nLooking back, what made Hamlin\u2019s collapse all the more shocking last Monday night was how it followed the most routine of tackles. At this point it\u2019s a fair guess that no play all season has been watched more often online. The telecast didn\u2019t keep showing the tackle out of a sense of decency. Instead, cameras lingered over the players\u2019 anguished reactions, showing teammates huddling around Hamlin\u2019s body on the field, weeping and praying while medics struggled to save him for nearly 10 minutes.\n\nThe scene may have summoned to some minds famous paintings by artists like Giotto, Titian, Caravaggio and D\u00fcrer of mourning crowds surrounding Jesus as he is taken down from the cross or entombed. For centuries, church- and museum-goers have gaped, with something approximating the same mix of fear and confusion, at these pictures of violence and despair. America certainly didn\u2019t invent rubbernecking. Or violent sports. Twenty-nine Formula 1 drivers died during the \u201960s in Formula 1 or other racing cars; 18 during the \u201970s. Auto racing was popular in Europe and considered all the more glamorous for being dangerous. Things changed after the death of Ayrton Senna, the sublime Brazilian driver, in 1994. New regulations and technologies arrived. A culture of safety emerged. In the United States, navel-gazing about football and violence is nothing new. Between 1900 and 1905, 15 years before the National Football League was founded, at least 45 college players died from broken necks and backs, concussions and internal injuries they suffered playing football, according to The Washington Post. The death toll troubled Americans enough that President Theodore Roosevelt and a number of university presidents pressed for reforms. Today we gather in front of our screens by the tens of millions to witness collisions of increasingly spectacular brutality with the expectation that modern players, vastly better trained and equipped than they were a century ago, will pop back up like John Wick and Spider-Man.\n\nOf course, we know that sometimes they don\u2019t. The long-term effects of concussions have increasingly become a topic of public concern, alongside gun control, mass shootings and crime. But Americans juggle conflicted feelings about the violent game. Some parents, and even former N.F.L. stars, are discouraging their young children from taking up tackle football. At the same time, football, like no other sport, crosses politics, gender, race, age and class in the United States. N.F.L. games accounted for a whopping 82 of the 100 most-watched television broadcasts last year, according to Nielsen, making it the last remaining form of water cooler entertainment in our atomized culture. Not coincidentally pro football only took off as a national sport during the late \u201950s and \u201960s when it embraced television, which marketed football\u2019s brutality as a counterweight to baseball\u2019s languor. The league cooked up documentaries and highlights shows, memorably narrated for years by John Facenda, the voice of God. \u201cThe game is a time warp where the young dream of growing up and the old remember youth,\u201d he intoned. As the writer James Surowiecki put it, NFL Films \u201ctried to simultaneously convey the gritty reality of the game and mythicize it in a Homeric fashion.\u201d This was also the era of America\u2019s metastasizing debacle in Vietnam. A 1967 documentary, \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d exalted N.F.L. linebackers who, like American soldiers in Da Nang and along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, were on \u201csearch-and-destroy\u201d missions. Head coaches like Vince Lombardi were lionized as tactical generals leading self-sacrificing armies of clean-cut soldiers to victory. The nation was on the verge of coming apart and football needed its own counter culture representative, who arrived in the green and white uniform of the New York Jets in the upstart American Football League. While campuses were erupting with antiwar protests, the Jets\u2019 playboy quarterback, Joe Namath, with his long hair, fur coats and bedroom eyes, famously predicted the Jets would beat the N.F.L.\u2019s ultra-establishmentarian Baltimore Colts and win Super Bowl III. When the Jets won, football not only survived the upheaval. It came out richer, more popular than ever and unified. At least on Sundays, Americans could dream about Hollywood endings despite their divisions. We are again a nation divided, and reading more than ever into the meaning of the game and what, wishfully or otherwise, it says about us. Buffalo fans this Sunday suggested Hamlin\u2019s recovery was a metaphor for the resilience of a city battered by storms, decline and crime. As if on cue, the Bills returned the opening kickoff against the Patriots for a touchdown, the first time the team had done that in 18 years. A nail-biter through the first half, Buffalo pulled away in the second. \u201cWe all won,\u201d Hamlin tweeted from his hospital bed. As Nantz, the announcer, put it: \u201cLove for Damar, it was definitely in the air. Not just here. All across this league, this nation.\u201d Then he asked the melancholy question that seemed to sum up the week. \u201cThe love, the support, the prayers,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we live like that every day?\u201d",

            "content": "The director Ruggero Deodato, best known for his shocking 1980 film \u201cCannibal Holocaust,\u201d occasionally appeared in other directors\u2019 movies. He is seen here in Eli Roth\u2019s \u201cHostel: Part II\u201d (2007).\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHe directed a variety of movies in a variety of genres. But it was a gruesome found-footage film that brought him both fame and infamy.\n\nWhen you make the most infamous movie ever to come out of a genre sometimes called the cannibal vomitorium, you\u2019ve achieved true cinematic notoriety. That distinction belongs to the Italian director Ruggero Deodato, whose \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d is said to have gotten him briefly accused of murder because of death scenes that seemed a little too real, as well as generating complaints for obscenity and animal cruelty. The film, released in 1980 in Italy and later (sometimes after overcoming bans) in other countries, drew scalding comments from critics and some film scholars. In 1985 the \u201cPhantom of the Movies\u201d column in The Daily News of New York called it \u201cthe kind of brain-damaged, stomach-churning cinematic offal that gives junk movies a bad name.\u201d And yet the movie also developed a cult following and is widely credited with influencing later films, especially \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (1999), which, like \u201cCannibal Holocaust,\u201d used a found-footage conceit intended to leave viewers asking, \u201cWas it real?\u201d\n\nMr. Deodato died on Dec. 29 in Rome. He was 83. Eugenio Ercolani, a filmmaker and film historian who had interviewed Mr. Deodato extensively, confirmed the death. He said Mr. Deodato had pneumonia and had been experiencing kidney and liver failure. Mr. Deodato made a variety of movies in a career that began in the 1960s, as well as directing commercials and episodes of Italian television series. There was, for instance, \u201cLive Like a Cop, Die Like a Man\u201d (1976), a crime thriller that Mr. Deodato said was one of his personal favorites. \u201cLast Feelings\u201d (1978), a romantic drama about a competitive swimmer who learns he has a terminal illness, drew comparisons (usually unfavorable) to \u201cLove Story,\u201d the 1970 American blockbuster. But his horror films of the late 1970s and \u201980s overshadowed everything else. He directed in a subgenre that, generally speaking, featured encounters between modern Westerners and jungle dwellers, with the Westerners not faring well. Before \u201cCannibal Holocaust,\u201d he worked the territory with \u201cThe Last Survivor\u201d (1977, also released under assorted other titles), in which oil prospectors whose plane is damaged in a rough landing in the Philippines are greeted by cannibals. \u201cDirector Ruggero Deodato\u2019s unselective barrage of torture and bloodletting includes termites eating human flesh, a python eating an iguana and a girl giving birth and tossing her infant to a hungry crocodile,\u201d Linda Gross wrote in a 1978 review in The Los Angeles Times. \u201cPromotion material claims \u2018The Last Survivor\u2019 was made among authentic tribes and that one crew member who disappeared during filmmaking is presumed to be a victim of cannibalistic rites,\u201d she added. \u201cPity the cannibals didn\u2019t eat the film instead.\u201d\n\nAnd then came \u201cCannibal Holocaust.\u201d Filmed in Leticia, in the rain forest of southern Colombia near the country\u2019s borders with Peru and Brazil, it tells the story of an American professor who travels to the Amazon to investigate the disappearance of four journalists who had gone there to make a documentary on cannibal tribes. He finds their film, which recorded atrocities the journalists themselves committed as well as their brutal deaths.\n\nThough Mr. Deodato used local villagers for much of the cast, he brought in some young actors to play the Westerners and, he said, had them sign agreements to not appear in anything else for a year, to keep up the illusion that parts of the movie were real. That came back to haunt him. He said he was accused of actually murdering the actors \u2014 of, essentially, making a snuff film \u2014 and had to seek them out and produce them in public to get those charges dropped. Other charges, though, stuck, including ones stemming from the real deaths of several animals during the filming. \u201cTo confiscate the film the authorities applied a public health law banning the importing of Spanish bullfighting in Italy, and on the basis of this law they seized the film,\u201d he told Starburst magazine years later. \u201cI was fined millions of lira and given a four months suspended sentence.\u201d Mr. Ercolani, who included an interview with Mr. Deodato in his book \u201cDarkening the Italian Screen: Interviews With Genre and Exploitation Directors Who Debuted in the 1950s and 1960s\u201d (2019) and produced the special features included in a recent rerelease of \u201cCannibal Holocaust,\u201d said that Mr. Deodato \u201cin many ways composed, rather than directed, \u2018Cannibal Holocaust,\u2019 as if in a long improvisational jazz session.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuggero Deodato was a director who put himself at the service of the market\u2019s needs,\u201d Mr. Ercolani said by email. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an intellectual, but he was an acutely instinctive man and director. He loved the process of storytelling, may it be in films, TV series or commercials. He had a great sense of rhythm and could recognize a good story.\u201d \u201cThis is not to say he wouldn\u2019t put any thought into what he did,\u201d he added, \u201cbut he was a man who gave priority to what he felt rather than what he thought. In many ways you could say he followed his gut right into film history with \u2018Cannibal Holocaust.\u2019\u201d Mr. Deodato was born on May 7, 1939, in Potenza, in southern Italy. His family moved to the Parioli neighborhood of Rome when he was a child, and he got a taste of acting. \u201cI participated in the early to mid-\u201950s in a handful of films,\u201d he said in his interview for Mr. Ercolani\u2019s book, \u201cand I was even called by Federico Fellini to audition for a role \u2014 I don\u2019t remember for which film \u2014 but in the meantime I had gone through puberty and I had lost my boyish charm. I wore glasses, had bad skin, and was discarded immediately.\u201d As a teenager he befriended Renzo Rossellini, son of the director Roberto Rossellini, which provided him with more connections in the film world. In the 1960s he worked with a number of Italian directors on a variety of movies, including Antonio Margheriti\u2019s horror and fantasy titles (\u201cHorror Castle,\u201d \u201cAnthar l\u2019Invincibile\u201d) and Sergio Corbucci\u2019s westerns (\u201cDjango\u201d). \u201cI was lucky enough to have been exposed to many different directors,\u201d he said, \u201cand each one of them has been essential to my growth. Margheriti taught me a lot about special effects, while from Sergio Corbucci I inherited a certain taste for violence and brutality.\u201d\n\nMr. Deodato was married to the actress Silvia Dionisio in the 1970s and since the 1990s had been in a relationship with the actress Valentina Lainati. He is also survived by a son, Saverio, and a daughter, Beatrice. Mr. Deodato\u2019s movies after \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d included \u201cCut and Run\u201d (1985), which involved a cable news crew, drug smuggling and lots of corpses. \u201cYou can wait years for a movie as bad as \u2018Cut and Run,\u2019\u201d Bill Cosford wrote in a review in The Miami Herald. He also acted occasionally, in his own movies and those of others; his credits included an appearance in \u201cHostel: Part II\u201d (2007) by the director Eli Roth, a fan of \u201cCannibal Holocaust.\u201d Mr. Deodato was still racking up minor directing credits until a few years ago. Throughout his career, he was constantly asked about his most famous creation. \u201cHe would at times embellish and build upon the numerous legends and myths that surround the complicated making of the film, often contradicting himself in the process,\u201d Mr. Ercolani said. \u201cWhat is evident is that \u2018Cannibal Holocaust\u2019 ended up being a gilded cage for its director. \u201cI feel a large portion of Deodato\u2019s life has been passed battling his own creature, trying to reason with it, or maybe simply trying to fully understand it, and fending off perceptions the film generated about him over the years while embracing the fame it brought him. Deodato was a fun-loving, womanizing, outrageous, egocentric man, larger than life in so many ways, who found himself living for decades with this dark, fascinatingly twisted creature that he tried to educate and direct but that would not listen.\u201d",

Add to the list another cheeky entry from Louis and Matt Catizone, the alchemists behind St. Agrestis in Brooklyn. Joining their alcohol-free Phony Negroni is the new Amaro Falso. It offers the same blend of herbs, botanicals and citrus as their regular Amaro, making it as seriously bitter but with no alcohol. It comes in individual 200 milliliter (6.8 ounce) bottles with a smidgen of added carbonation; serve it before or after dinner chilled or over ice.

She lost her job when the pandemic hit and began freelance baking using what she learned at home from her mother. Now, the 27-year old has her own compact shop with a few seats at a window counter, opening Saturday in the East Village, where the specialty is Instagrammable layer cakes in various sizes lavishly decorated with fresh flowers. \u201cIt\u2019s what my family was known for,\u201d she said.

A new one, Moveable Feast, featuring menus designed by the chefs of Michelin-starred restaurants, serves parties of four or more. It\u2019s now up and ready with the chef Amanda Cohen\u2019s Dirt Candy in New York for January. The vegetarian menu offers Cheddar and parsley Chex nibbles, seaweed \u201ccaviar\u201d sandwiches, cauliflower schnitzel with grits, chopped salad, pickled cabbage, gigante beans, a baguette with amba (pickled mango) and labneh butter, and popcorn pudding.

At a little more than a buck apiece they\u2019re cheaper than oysters that you have to shuck yourself. If your arsenal is equipped with the proper clamps and skinny forks, so much the better.

            "section": "Well",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIn 2004, Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, watched knowledge workers go about a typical day at the office. Using a stopwatch, she noted every time they switched tasks on their computer, moving from a spreadsheet to an email to a web page to a different web page and back to the spreadsheet. She found that people averaged just two and a half minutes on a given task before switching. When Dr. Mark repeated the experiment in 2012, the average time office workers spent on a task had dropped to 75 seconds. And it has continued to drop from there. \u201cOur attention spans while on our computers and smartphones have become short \u2014 crazily short \u2014 as we now spend about 47 seconds on any screen on average,\u201d Dr. Mark wrote in her new book, \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity.\u201d Anyone who\u2019s tried to study for an exam, write a report or read a book knows how hard it is to concentrate for significant chunks of time. Typically, digital devices are to blame for the disruption. The internet is omniscient, our phones omnipotent, and together they demand and destroy our concentration. Even when we really try to focus on a task, we often find we can\u2019t, our eyes glazing over and our thoughts drifting.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to wrest back control of your attention. They don\u2019t require swearing off technology altogether, but you do need some self-restraint and a few well-timed alarms. Notifications are one major source of distraction \u2014 those pings and dings pull you out of your work and prompt you to check your texts, email or Slack. Because our brains are evolutionarily designed to pay attention to novelty, these alerts are almost impossible to ignore. And if you try to, you\u2019ll likely find your anxiety mounting. In one diabolical study, psychologists brought heavy and moderate smartphone users into the lab under the auspices of a different experiment. They hooked the participants up to skin conductance monitors, which measure levels of arousal, and took away their phones, telling them that they interfered with the research equipment. Then the researchers texted the participants multiple times; the phones were close enough to hear but too far away to check. When their phones buzzed, the participants\u2019 arousal levels spiked. \u201cThey felt like they needed to answer that text or at least see who it was from, and they couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Larry Rosen, a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills and a co-author on the study. \u201cAnd that gave them anxiety.\u201d Turning off notifications is a good way to reduce distractions \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s a classic tip \u2014 but it won\u2019t completely solve the problem. In her research on office workers, Dr. Mark found that external distractions accounted for only half of the interruptions in focus. The other half were prompted by an internal motivation to switch tasks. Most interesting, Dr. Mark observed that when the number of external interruptions waned, the number of self-interruptions rose.\n\n\u201cWe get into this pattern of having short attention spans,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re not being interrupted by something external to us, then we switch gears and begin to interrupt ourselves.\u201d Dr. Rosen hypothesizes that these urges to self-distract are caused by stress. Research shows that heavier smartphone use is correlated with higher levels of cortisol and other markers of stress. Rising anxiety could become an internal signal to look at your texts or Twitter, even without a chime or vibration. When there are no notifications, Dr. Rosen said, people \u201cget a strong internal sign from their anxiety system that says, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I have to check in!\u2019 And so they do.\u201d According to Dr. Mark, we also grab our phones because we need a break. Simply put, our brains aren\u2019t capable of focusing for long periods of time. Sustaining attention and resisting distractions uses up cognitive resources, and we need to replenish them periodically to regain focus. There\u2019s no equation to calculate the number of breaks you need per day, but Dr. Mark said that it\u2019s normal for focus to ebb and flow. \u201cWe can\u2019t be expected to hold sustained attention for a long period of time, in the same way a person can\u2019t lift weights all day,\u201d she said. While a walk around the block or 10 minutes of meditation would likely be more rejuvenating, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with scrolling on social media or playing a repetitive game like Candy Crush to recharge. The problem arises when the breaks become longer or more frequent than you intended. This is where a timer and self-control come in. To increase your attention span, Dr. Rosen recommended employing what he calls a \u201ctech break.\u201d Before you have to focus on a task, take one or two minutes to open all your favorite apps. Then set a timer for 15 minutes, silence your phone, turn it face down and set it to the side. When the timer goes off, you get another one or two minutes to check your phone \u2014 a tech break. Repeat this cycle three or four times before taking a longer break from your work. (Fans of the Pomodoro Technique will recognize this structure.) The goal is to gradually increase the time between your tech breaks, building up to 20-, 30- and even 45-minute stretches. Dr. Rosen said you\u2019ll know you\u2019re ready to focus for longer periods when the timer goes off and you want to stay on task instead of reaching for your device. Tech breaks aren\u2019t only for work settings; you can use them any time you want to be present in the moment. Dr. Rosen advised implementing them during dinner, particularly if you have frequent conflicts with teens over cellphone use at the table.\n\nAnother strategy Dr. Mark recommended is to increase your self-awareness about your technology use. When you have an urge to open Instagram, for example, ask yourself why: Do you feel exhausted and need a break? Will this help restore you? If so, go for it. After a few minutes, check in again and ask if the app is still giving you value. If not, it\u2019s time to get back to work. Neither Dr. Mark nor Dr. Rosen are fans of trying to go cold turkey by declaring a phone-free day or using software to block certain websites. People inevitably return to their old habits when they have access again, and they don\u2019t improve their self control. Tech breaks and self-awareness can help you control the urge to jump from screen to screen, but Maryanne Wolf, a professor-in-residence at the University of California, Los Angeles Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said that even when we\u2019re reading just one screen, we aren\u2019t engaging with it deeply. That\u2019s because screens are designed to make us read very quickly \u2014 to scan, skim and scroll. As a result, we don\u2019t give the text our full attention and are more apt to miss information. \u201cThe nature of a screen, if you just think about it, is to constantly refresh the information,\u201d Dr. Wolf said. \u201cThere is a psychological mind-set to go from the start to the finish as quickly as possible.\u201d Traditionally, our brains tended to read print materials more slowly, in part because we were more likely to go back and double-check what we just read. That extra time lent itself to sophisticated mental processes like critical analysis, inference, deduction and empathy. Unfortunately, simply printing out an article or opting for a paperback book instead of your Kindle won\u2019t guarantee that you suddenly become a more engaged reader. Our brains adapt to read in the style of the medium we use most often, and chances are you spend a lot more time reading on a screen than you do on paper. As a result, Dr. Wolf said, you likely now read in print the way you read on a screen. \u201cMany people have lost the ability to really immerse themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have developed a cognitive impatience about our reading.\u201d\n\nTo get back in the practice of what Dr. Wolf calls \u201cdeep reading,\u201d try to dedicate at least 20 minutes a day to reading a physical book, combined with Dr. Mark and Dr. Rosen\u2019s tips to fight distraction. Start with something you want to read for pleasure, set an alarm for 20 minutes, put your phone on silent, and make yourself read slowly and deliberately. Don\u2019t get frustrated if you\u2019re not absorbed right away \u2014 when Dr. Wolf tried this experiment on herself, it took her two weeks before she was able to fully engage with and enjoy what she was reading. Even if you\u2019re not an avid reader, the exercise can help you regain the ability to focus deeply on what you\u2019re doing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in being able to feel that you can control your attention,\u201d Dr. Mark said. \u201cYou\u2019re in control of your behavior.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe ancient city\u2019s leaders hope the new recreation area will lure more visitors from abroad. It has already impressed the talent at home.\n\nThey built it, and people came. Teenage boys, mostly, from Roma Nord, Ostia, Prenestina, Monterotondo and other suburbs, trekking to Rome\u2019s city center, boards in hand, to heelflip and airwalk and boardslide among the obstacles of a new skatepark, which opened to the public just before Christmas. \u201cWe were desperate; we didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d said Lorenzo Ficini, 27, a marketing specialist and skateboarder who, as if on cue, approached a reporter to say that he wanted to thank the city for the skatepark. An unprompted public relations triumph. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a dream come true \u2014 the structure is great. And then,\u201d Mr. Ficini said, nodding his head southward, where the upper arches of the Colosseum emerged above a row of trees. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. It\u2019s marvelous.\u201d The skatepark \u2014 perched on the Oppian Hill, as this area overlooking the first-century amphitheater has been known since ancient times \u2014 is brazenly praised by Rome city officials as the skatepark with the best view in the world.\n\nThe unique location, he said, helped convince World Skate, the governing body of all sports on skating wheels, that it should hold a street skateboarding competition in Rome last summer. The event drew hundreds of top athletes from around the world, and the state-of-the-art park built for the competition was left behind for Romans to enjoy. \u201cIt shows how a one-off event can have a long-lasting impact on a city,\u201d Mr. Onorato said. On a recent afternoon, the steady \u201cthump, thump\u201d of skateboarders sticking their landings filled the air, along with an occasional, \u201cWhoop!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for us,\u201d said Papik Rossi, 49, a fixture on the Rome skateboarding circuit. \u201cWe never had a center-scene skatepark.\u201d\n\nHe fell in love with skateboarding after watching the 1985 classic film \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d he said, and, lowering his voice, he added, \u201cThey will deny it, but half the people I know started for the same reason.\u201d The new park is \u201cgood for new skaters,\u201d he said, but he still prefers the streets. When Mr. Rossi began skateboarding in the 1980s, practically all of the city\u2019s skaters were on a first-name basis. Ugo Bertolucci, 49, was also a part of that early scene. Then, Mr. Bertolucci said, skateboarders were considered \u201cextraterrestrials,\u201d freaks in a nation where soccer was king. \u201cNow, it\u2019s an Olympic sport,\u201d he shrugged.\n\nMr. Bertolucci recalled that, before the internet, it was harder to learn new tricks. Back then, skateboarders like himself would watch VHS tapes of their counterparts in the United States \u2014 the birthplace of skateboarding \u2014 \u201cover and over again, until they were worn through.\u201d Learning by doing, falls were inevitable. Today, a more formal sort of education comes from the many skateboarding schools that have sprung up amid the sport\u2019s growing popularity. Those lessons prevent many injuries, said Mr. Bertolucci, who now builds skateparks in northern Italy, where skateboarding is more common. \u201cBack then,\u201d he said, \u201cyou had to be tough.\u201d And you have to be willing to risk fines because skateboarding is banned on Rome\u2019s streets. The preferred haunts for the rebels: the Foro Italico, the site of the Olympic stadium, and the outlying EUR neighborhood. Both are Fascist-era areas dense with travertine stone of varied geometric shapes and expanses \u2014 a skateboarder\u2019s dream. That dream has now shifted to an area that until only a few months ago created nightmares for Mr. Onorato, the city councilor.\n\nWhen Rome\u2019s center-left administration came into power in October 2021, the area where the skatepark now stands was littered with syringes and run down, its benches defaced and broken. A more modest skatepark that was there was repeatedly vandalized and then closed after a young boy hurt himself on a \u201cdeteriorated track,\u201d a city spokesman said. Local newspapers chronicled the site\u2019s deterioration, photographic indictments showing piles of garbage and broken ramps. \u201cDo you know what my biggest nightmare was?\u201d Mr. Onorato asked in a telephone interview. \u201cThat nine months ago, a foreign correspondent would have visited the area because they would have written an expos\u00e9 saying that 200 meters from the Colosseum was an area of drug deals and drug users.\u201d \u201cThis is no longer the case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new skatepark is part of a larger playground, and the project, which cost about 200,000 euros, or about $210,000, to build, will include a small soccer pitch, a volleyball court, a spot with fitness machines and an area facing the Colosseum with checker and chess boards. \u201cJust like Central Park,\u201d Mr. Onorato said. And vandalism, Italian officials say, will be a thing of the past. Before, Mr. Onorato said, surveillance was slipshod, and the area had been left mostly to itself. Now, maintenance and security of the skatepark has been entrusted to Sport e Salute (Sport and Health), a company owned by the Ministry of Economy that manages major sporting events and promotes sports and well-being. \u201cWe\u2019re used to looking after sporting areas, and we\u2019ll be able to do the same for the playground at the Oppian Hill,\u201d said Vito Cozzoli, the president and chief executive of Sport e Salute. \u201cWe also spoke to the skaters, who are the main users, and they\u2019re going to help us look after the area, aware also of privilege of having at their disposal a park with a view of the Colosseum.\u201d\n\nThe skatepark is also meeting a growing demand in the city, where skateboarding\u2019s popularity has risen since the sport was featured a few years ago in the Tokyo Olympics, said Marla Ascone, 44, who, with her husband, Nicol\u00f2 Mattia Cimini, 43, owns and manages a private skatepark in Rome. \u201cNowadays, when we go out, we often come across skaters we don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, you knew everybody.\u201d As dusk fell, the skateboarders took their last rides. One of them, Fabio Spalvieri, bemoaned the lack of structures in his city, Frosinone, about 46 miles southeast of Rome, forcing him to travel. \u201cAt least it is fun,\u201d he said. Now that the skatepark is done, Mr. Onorato said he was certain that people would come from abroad, too, citing emails he had received from skaters around the world intrigued by the site. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole group of people who, thanks to that park, will come to Rome not to see the Sistine Chapel or St. Peter\u2019s, but because they want to skate in the park,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what we wanted \u2014 to communicate to the world an image of a more contemporary city.\u201d\n\nThe spruced-up park has made locals happy, too. Mostly. \u201cIt had been abandoned. At least now people are using it,\u201d said Michele Cubino, the owner of a cafe just around the corner from the skatepark. \u201cOr at least they\u2019ll use it until someone hurts themselves because it was unsupervised,\u201d he added. \u201cThen they\u2019ll just shut it down.\u201d",

What 19th-century woman with genius and gumption wouldn\u2019t chafe at her restricted life and long for the broad freedoms of manhood? The insipidity, conventionality and powerlessness of Victorian female life drove many a woman insane. Sigmund Freud thought women envied men because men had penises. Today we understand it was the power and privileges of manhood symbolized by the penis that women envied. It\u2019s sad that we seem to be going backward by seeing women longing for masculine freedoms and advantages as evidence that they are really men! Katha Pollitt\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is a poet, essayist and critic who focuses on political and social issues, including feminism.\n\nYou have to trust Louisa May Alcott, the real-life tomboy Jo March from \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in how she understood herself: \u201cI am a man\u2019s soul, put by some freak of nature into a woman\u2019s body.\u201d That statement in its frank simplicity defines transgenderism. It\u2019s not about sexual orientation: Transgender people can be homosexual or heterosexual. It\u2019s about a spirit of self squeezed into the wrong vessel. As a transgender acquaintance once said, it\u2019s like wearing shoes on the wrong feet and discovering how much better it feels when you switch the shoes around. Louisa May Alcott did say she was \u201cmore than half-persuaded\u201d that she was a \u201cman\u2019s soul.\u201d When she was then asked why, her reply was this: \u201c\u2018Well, for one thing,\u2019 and the blue-gray eyes sparkled with laughter, \u2018because I have fallen in love in my life with so many pretty girls, and never once the least little bit with any man.\u2019\u201d Just before this exchange, she had described how she used to think she had the soul of a horse because \u201cas a long-limbed child,\u201d she liked running through fields. The quote, like other \u201cfacts\u201d cited by Peyton Thomas out of context, is unconvincing as a serious expression of gender identity, rather than one about sexuality or sexism.\n\nUnlike James Barry or Albert Cashier, Louisa May Alcott continued to live as a woman when women were not granted basic human rights. This piece perpetuates the pernicious, false idea that supporting trans rights equates to believing that all women naturally \u201ccare much for girls\u2019 things.\u201d While I have no objection to considering that Louisa May Alcott may have identified as a man, as Peyton Thomas suggests, I think there is another way to interpret her writings. Alcott lived in a time when only white men were free. Perhaps she was expressing her inability to live the life of a contemporary woman, a life that the other women around her seemed capable of embracing. Perhaps, had women of the time been free to wear pants, travel, smoke, cut their hair, earn a living outside the home, not marry, play sports, drink whiskey, and more, she could have been comfortable being a woman. As a young girl reading all of the Alcott books in the 1960s and \u201970s, I remember identifying with Alcott\u2019s sentiments and wishing I were a boy. But that was not a wish to become a man, but to have the man\u2019s freedom. Maybe Alcott wanted to be a man, or maybe being a man was the only way to get what she really wanted: freedom to be herself.\n\nIf anyone needed further evidence that the dangerous, misguided claims of rigged elections by former President Donald Trump had horrific domestic and international implications, they need look no further than the insurrection that recently took place at Brazil\u2019s government offices. The parallels to the awful events that occurred on Jan. 6 two years ago are unmistakable. Both featured a democratically ousted president unwilling to accept his loss and a subsequent insurrection.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the United States\u2019 democracy is the peaceful transition of power between presidents. What happened on Jan. 6 was terrible and should be called out in no subtle terms. The insurrection that took place at Brazil\u2019s government offices proved that former President Trump\u2019s dangerous strategy of denying democratic elections lives on and poses a danger to our democracy\u2019s survival. And if we want to save democracy not only in the United States but also across the world, we must reject and call out any election denying before it is too late.\n\nAs the co-author of 10 books \u2014 for authors ranging from famous folks to unknown heroes \u2014 I think your article about ghostwriting misses an important point. There\u2019s a good reason that co-writers should have their names on the covers. As everyone with a byline in today\u2019s paper knows, having your name on something you\u2019ve written offers more than ego gratification and something for your mom to clip out. It also conveys responsibility. If your name is on it and something is wrong, it\u2019s you who gets the blame \u2014 a fear that keeps you honest and careful.\n\nWhen celebrities pretend they\u2019ve written their stories without help they may be perpetrating the smallest of lies. But I like to think that when authors are honest and up front about having co-authors, it allows the reader a little more faith in the rest of the stories that they, and we, are telling. Ghosts can\u2019t be seen. Writers should be.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe reporter, Dion Rabouin, who is Black, was handcuffed and placed in a police vehicle after conducting interviews outside a bank in November.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department has opened an internal investigation into the detainment of a Wall Street Journal reporter who was conducting interviews outside a Chase Bank in November. The reporter, Dion Rabouin, who is Black, was reporting outside the bank when he was handcuffed and placed in a police vehicle, The Wall Street Journal said in a statement. Mr. Rabouin\u2019s detainment occurred on Nov. 23 but gained widespread attention after the television station ABC15 reported on the episode on Wednesday. Footage taken by a bystander shows Mr. Rabouin being handcuffed and sitting inside a police vehicle. An officer can be heard telling him, \u201cI\u2019m not giving you any more chances.\u201d Mr. Rabouin is heard responding, \u201cYou\u2019re not giving me any chances for what? I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Police Department said that it had opened an \u201cadministrative investigation\u201d after receiving a letter from the editor in chief of The Journal, which, the police said, expressed concerns about the \u201cinteraction\u201d between Mr. Rabouin and one of their officers. \u201cBank personnel contacted police after they received customer complaints that a man was approaching people as they entered the bank asking them personal questions,\u201d the department said. It added that the interaction between Mr. Rabouin and the police officer took place on private property. Once the investigation is complete, it will be made public, the department said. Mr. Rabouin was not charged. According to a police report posted by ABC15, a Chase Bank employee notified the authorities of a \u201csuspicious person outside the bank\u201d who had identified himself as a reporter and was refusing to leave. The officer, Caleb Zimmerman, said in the report that he had spoken with bank staff members, who said that they had informed Mr. Rabouin that he was making customers uncomfortable. Officer Zimmerman said that he had concluded that Mr. Rabouin was trespassing.\n\n\u201cHe stated he had his I.D. on him, but refused to produce it,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAt that time, I told Dion to turn around and put his hands behind his back, which he did not do.\u201d The incident comes amid a sweeping federal investigation into the conduct of the Phoenix Police Department and whether it engaged in discriminatory and abusive practices and used excessive force. The Journal said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d at the treatment of Mr. Rabouin, who is based in New York and covers finance. \u201cWe have asked the Phoenix Police Department to pursue a thorough investigation into the incident and explain why their officers needlessly escalated the situation and took these aggressive steps,\u201d The Journal said in a statement. \u201cNo journalist should ever be detained simply for exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d Mr. Rabouin did not immediately respond to requests for an interview on Sunday but has acknowledged the incident on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThings really escalated quickly,\u201d Mr. Rabouin said in an interview with ABC15. He said that he had been in Phoenix spending time with family when he went to the bank to interview people and that he intentionally did not \u201cdress up\u201d \u2014 he wore shorts and a T-shirt \u2014 because he did not want bank customers to believe he was trying to sell them something.\n\nHe told the television station that he was working on a story and that he was looking for real people, not experts and economists. He did not identify the nature of the story. He said that he had been standing on the sidewalk next to the building when bank employees came outside to ask what he was doing. Mr. Rabouin told ABC15 that he had identified himself as a journalist and that no one had asked him to leave. Shortly after, Mr. Rabouin said, a police officer showed up. He said that he had offered to leave but that the officer grabbed him and told him, \u201cThis can get bad for you if you don\u2019t comply.\u201d Maura Cordova, a spokeswoman for Chase Bank, would not comment further on the details surrounding Mr. Rabouin\u2019s detainment. \u201cWe apologize to Mr. Rabouin,\u201d she said on Sunday. \u201cI have nothing else to add.\u201d According to the letter sent by The Journal\u2019s editor in chief, Matt Murray, Mr. Rabouin had been interviewing passers-by on a public sidewalk outside the bank when he was approached by an officer, who told Mr. Rabouin that he was trespassing. \u201cAt no point until then had Mr. Rabouin been asked to leave the sidewalk outside the bank by Chase personnel or anyone else,\u201d Mr. Murray said, adding that Mr. Rabouin had a \u201cclear right\u201d to be present on the sidewalk while reporting. He said that Mr. Rabouin offered to leave but was then handcuffed and placed in a police vehicle. Footage showed that Mr. Rabouin kept \u201ca calm and professional demeanor throughout the episode,\u201d Mr. Murray said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIn a city facing wide-ranging challenges, the gospel music you hear at Praise Fest can be a balm for the collective spirit.\n\nOn the final day of the 13th annual Praise Fest, the free gospel music festival that started after Hurricane Katrina to bring locals back to New Orleans, the skies above Bayou St. John turned gray. Then, around 2 on an afternoon in October, an eerily familiar sight appeared: torrential rainfall. Pools of water pocked the bayou grass as festivalgoers scrambled to their cars. Attendance for Praise Fest, the first one held in person since the pandemic began, was modest (though organizers said it was about what they expected) \u2014 the conditions may not have helped. Bishop Ryan Warner, president and chief executive of Versatile Entertainment, which runs Praise Fest, clomped around the grounds in his rain boots, directing traffic. The rain would pass, he insisted, and the festival would continue. That was the New Orleans way. Anchored by the sound of organs, pianos, tambourines, drums and melodic voices preaching the word of God, gospel music is a fixture in Black Christian churches across the United States, especially in the South. In a city facing so many challenges \u2014 whether hurricanes or housing insecurity \u2014 it can be a necessary balm for the collective spirit. \u201cThere\u2019s so much craziness happening in the world today,\u201d said Cordell Chambliss, a local pianist and retired music teacher. It was about 24 hours before the storm, and Mr. Chambliss sat on a bench wearing black sunglasses and a backward hat with the strap emblazoned with \u201cAloha.\u201d \u201cGospel music is the good news,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to spread the good news.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of Our City, a series focused on how people around the United States use public and shared spaces to build community. Once the sky had cleared up, about an hour after the rain began, Bishop Warner, 47, a laid-back man with a smooth voice, climbed atop the stage and, with a microphone in hand, declared that the festivities would carry on. \u201cI will never question the Lord,\u201d he said. The two dozen or so who remained dragged their chairs away from the massive tents and up to the stage where, they believed, God\u2019s presence was clear. \u201cGod has been good to me,\u201d Angela Lindsey, 60, said the day before. Ms. Lindsey, a New Orleans native, sat on her lawn chair behind the vendors hawking discount jewelry along the slow-moving bayou water, where ducks and birds cooled off. She sang gospel in church with her sisters growing up and moved to Mississippi after Katrina.\n\nMs. Lindsey makes frequent trips home to help take care of her son, who sustained a brain injury in a car accident, and to attend Praise Fest. Most of her family remains in New Orleans, which proved difficult when she came down with colon cancer. When one of her sisters died, Ms. Lindsey was unable to attend the funeral because of emergency surgery. Still, she remains grateful. \u201cI never was alone,\u201d Ms. Lindsey said, over the sound of soaring vocals. She found comfort during her sickness in memories of singing with her sisters, and something else: \u201cGod was always there.\u201d Ms. Lindsey and the rest in attendance were treated to a variety of different acts, from traditional gospel choirs to gospel-influenced R&B and hip-hop. \u201cNew Orleans, this is truly a gospel gumbo,\u201d said Josh Kagler, who performed alongside Tyrone Jefferson. \u201cGospel music in the city of New Orleans is foundation. It\u2019s family,\u201d he said. Here are clips from some of the most memorable performances from the festival.\n\nJoanna Hale-McGill, 38, was the first to take the stage after the rain. At the start of her set, a rainbow painted the sky. Ms. Hale-McGill, who hails from Meraux, just outside New Orleans, is an independent artist who blends hip-hop and gospel. A highlight was her performance of the 2008 song \u201cGod in Me\u201d by the gospel duo Mary Mary featuring Kierra \u201cKiki\u201d Sheard. Ms. Hale-McGill danced around the stage and flailed her arms in the air as she sang. \u201cYou\u2019re so fly, you\u2019re so high,\n\nEverybody around you trying to figure out why.\n\nYou\u2019re so cool, you win all the time,\n\nEverywhere you go, man, you get a lot of shine.\u201d \u201cThe lyrics to the song describe me perfectly. I\u2019m known around town as the girl that sparkles everywhere she goes,\u201d Ms. Hale-McGill said in an interview later.\n\nMr. Jefferson, 49, performed alongside his choir from the Abundant Life Tabernacle in New Orleans, as did Mr. Kagler, 36, the choir director. As Mr. Jefferson got the crowd going with his vocals, Mr. Kagler shook his head and stomped his feet and waved his arms until his bright pink Yankees hat fell of his head. Among Mr. Jefferson\u2019s performances, his rendition of Ricky Dillard\u2019s \u201cSearch Me Lord\u201d was memorable. \u201cSometimes we can be so stubborn, if you will, as it relates to us thinking we know everything,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said in a later interview. \u201cThe song simply says, \u2018Lord, you search me. Lord, you know whether I\u2019m right or wrong.\u2019\u201d Mr. Jefferson also performed an original song, \u201cTrouble in My Way,\u201d a rousing track meant to be a reminder of Jesus\u2019 healing abilities. \u201cThe beat brings you to church. It brings you right to church on a Sunday morning. Hand-clapping, foot-stomping,\u201d he said. \u201cWe on a thousand, as we say here in New Orleans.\u201d\n\nArthur Clayton IV, 45, hails from Marrero, La., fewer than 10 miles outside New Orleans. Alongside his choir, Anointed for Purpose, Mr. Clayton took delight in performing his friend VaShawn Mitchell\u2019s song \u201cBig.\u201d When his choir sang the words, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing my God cannot do,\u201d Mr. Clayton followed with, \u201cHe\u2019s a keeper, yes, he is.\u201d \u201cThat reminds me of how we all were kept during that moment of Covid,\u201d Mr. Clayton said in an interview. \u201cEven after Covid, here in New Orleans we went through a hurricane, and we were kept in that moment.\u201d\n\nThe sky was black by the time Zacardi Cortez, 37, the festival\u2019s closing act, took center stage. Mr. Cortez, whose 2012 album \u201cThe Introduction\u201d placed No. 2 on the Billboard magazine top gospel albums chart, shone under the stage\u2019s bright lights. One of the songs he performed, an original called \u201cPraise You,\u201d was a funk tune inspired by two of his idols, Prince and James Brown. His set took a turn on \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Good to Me,\u201d a slow, tender tribute to his faith. Mr. Cortez wrote the song not long after spending time in jail. \u201cGod just had to deal with me. He had to sit me down for a little while and show me some things. And a lot of great things were birthed out of that,\u201d Mr. Cortez said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that I got to a place where I\u2019ll never have to go through those situations again, because God has changed some things, turned some things around.\u201d Bishop Warner, the organizer, watched from the side as Mr. Cortez closed the festival. Praise Fest had been a success, he said, attracting about 2,000 people. The goal every year is to bring New Orleans a little hope, no matter how dire the circumstances. That\u2019s the meaning of gospel music, and it\u2019s a special ingredient that keeps spirits up. \u201cLet\u2019s say in a couple years, we\u2019re going to have another event like this,\u201d Bishop Warner said, referring to Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people. \u201cMan, you got to live life to the fullest, or you\u2019ll be caught in this, thinking you was going to try to get out, and you die in the process. \u201cYou got to keep moving.\u201d",

The N.F.L. is an unalterable narrative machine. More than any other sports league in America, and probably the world, it possesses a seemingly unparalleled ability to cast off bad news, survive and even thrive. Even as the league swims in controversy, there is another human drama to draw fans in each week, causing the latest obstacle to fade away. And in the Bills\u2019 game against the New England Patriots on Sunday, the story got only more heartwarming. Damar Hamlin, the lucky-to-be-alive player to whom this game had been dedicated, watched from his Cincinnati hospital bed, providing real-time commentary. Via social media, we got to see him react to his teammates\u2019 emotional play. Commenting on Hines\u2019s kick return, Hamlin, who wears No. 3, posted, \u201cGod Behind All this No Coincidence.\u201d\n\nThis game was powered by the deepest of emotions. It was about life and living, but also about the pain of loss. It was about Hamlin, but also about tried-and-true Buffalo, a city that over the past year has endured the pain of a racist mass shooting that killed 10 residents and a winter storm that claimed nearly 40. Had it been less than a week since Hamlin, 24, a second-year defensive back, collided with a Cincinnati Bengals player and gone into cardiac arrest during the first quarter of a Monday night game broadcast to millions of viewers? The Buffalo Bills safety went into cardiac arrest during an N.F.L. game in Cincinnati on Jan. 2. He was released from the hospital on Jan. 11.\n\u2022 None Injury and Reaction: The life-threatening injury to Damar Hamlin, which was televised on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d The life-threatening injury to Damar Hamlin, which was televised on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d resonated around the league and the world of sports\n\u2022 None His Recovery: Hamlin, who Hamlin, who returned home nine days after his collapse, appears to be on a good path for neurological recovery , though doctors said it was too early to know how far he is from returning to normal life.\n\u2022 None In His Hometown: As the news about Hamlin became more hopeful, anguish turned to \u201chappy tears\u201d in the As the news about Hamlin became more hopeful, anguish turned to \u201chappy tears\u201d in the tight-knit Pennsylvania borough where he grew up\n\u2022 None Emergency Response: When Hamlin\u2019s heart stopped, medical personnel could be heard making clear the severity of his condition and the efforts to keep him alive. When Hamlin\u2019s heart stopped, medical personnel could be heard making clear the severity of his condition and the efforts to keep him alive. Listen to the audio In that moment and over the course of the next hours, nobody knew, of course, whether Hamlin would live. All we knew was that he did not get up, that medical personnel pounded and shocked his chest in frantic attempts to revive his heart. We watched as he was carted off the field to the hospital in an ambulance. It could easily have been a terrible, tragic event \u2014 an N.F.L. player dying in front of millions of viewers.\n\nBut Hamlin, by some miracle, survived. And then, through the week, there were answers to countless prayers: Hamlin came to. Slowly, steadily, his condition improved. By Friday, Hamlin was appearing before his teammates by video chat from his hospital, flexing his biceps, showing a heart sign, saying, \u201cI love you boys.\u201d Hamlin\u2019s father, Mario, told the grieving and shocked Bills to win for his son. As the week went on, the news had gone from tragic to something bordering sublimely wonderful. And then, as Hines bolted down the sideline on Sunday, a truth once again emerged: Narrative is the engine that runs professional football. It makes the N.F.L. the most dominant, compelling league \u2014 and the one most durably able to slough off any type of crisis.\n\nBefore kickoff, in the tailgate parking lots outside the Bills\u2019 low-slung stadium, the scene was drenched with tributes to Hamlin. Parents, grandparents and young children wore newly bought No. 3 jerseys or carried heart-shaped signs with phrases like \u201cHamlin Strong\u201d written on them. A man clutched a nearly 12-foot wooden cross near a flashing sign that read, \u201cLove for Damar.\u201d I spoke to scores of fans who said they had barely slept that night after watching as Hamlin was carted off to a hospital. Many said they assumed the worst would happen. To say they\u2019d been shaken undersells their experience. But those same fans told me how their spirits soared as the week wore on and the news of Hamlin\u2019s recovery kept dripping in.\n\nNote that, like all players in this league, which trades on crippling violence, the terms of Hamlin\u2019s contract are not guaranteed. It took Hamlin nearly dying for the N.F.L. to step in and strike an ad hoc deal ensuring he gets every penny of his $3.6 million contract. The human, loving, resilient N.F.L. is the same league that keeps failing to do right by retired players struggling with dementia and other woes that emerge after years of hard collisions. It is the league of Deshaun Watson, Jon Gruden and Daniel Snyder and their more tawdry story lines. Who remembered any of it on Sunday? Not after the Bills won by a dozen points, in a game wrapped in the stirring story of Damar Hamlin\u2019s healing and Buffalo\u2019s compassionate, cathartic love.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFan tailgates aren\u2019t allowed at the College Football Playoff title game. It\u2019s just one sign of how the games have become more focused on TV.\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 There are many ways in which the College Football Playoff national championship game is different from other postseason events in the sport. To start, the matchup scheduled Monday night between Georgia and Texas Christian has much less of the circus of activities and events for players and fans that generally surrounds bowl games. The game itself is more businesslike, too, with the national championship providing more clear incentive for players to take the field than for the lower-tier bowl games that some players skip from fear of being injured ahead of the N.F.L. draft or the next college season. And for fans at SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, the game-day experience comes without perhaps college football\u2019s biggest staple: tailgating.\n\nEspecially in college towns, tailgating is arguably as much a part of the sport as the games, with fans setting up R.V.s and tents, playing music and eating food, and hanging out for hours before going into the stadium. Fans have complained about the lack of tailgating at the national championship game on social media, and even politicians joined in to joke that tailgating should be a legally protected right. \u201cI\u2019m sad, you know, tailgating is such a big part of our culture down in the South for football,\u201d said Danny Davis, who said he was a lifelong Georgia fan and traveled from Macon, Ga., to California for the game. \u201cIt\u2019s our Saturday church together. We fellowship, get food and sing songs and talk about the glory, so it is a bummer.\u201d Tailgates and bowl game experiences that cater to the fans in attendance have always been a part of the fabric of college football. Their absence Monday underscores how heavily the College Football Playoff is focused on serving another audience: the millions of television viewers. The television rights for the playoff are expected to swell to about $695 million for the last two seasons of its existing television contract with ESPN. Then they are expected to fetch much more after the 2025 season, when the deal expires. The increases are tied to increasing the playoff field to 12 teams from four, which creates more TV friendly matchups that lead to a national title. Yet the needs of television viewers have dampened moves by organizers to surround the games with hoopla for people experiencing the events in person, including fans and the teams themselves.\n\nAt the Pinstripe Bowl, held annually at Yankee Stadium, players go to the New York Stock Exchange and ring the bell. Teams went to the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld at the Holiday Bowl. Even in one of this season\u2019s playoff semifinals, the Fiesta Bowl, T.C.U. went to an Arizona Cardinals game and had an extravagant steak dinner.\n\nConversely, Georgia and T.C.U. arrived a few days before their national championship matchup, and had few activities beyond directly preparing to compete. \u201cAs far as the fan experience, it\u2019s been very underwhelming,\u201d Davis said. \u201cNot really like it has been in the past.\u201d The ban on tailgating was in effect last year at the championship game in Indianapolis, but tailgating was tough because of cold temperatures in the 20s. On Monday in Southern California, fans similarly had to contend with rain. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of tailgating; I don\u2019t understand all that went into the decision,\u201d said Southeastern Conference Commissioner Greg Sankey, whose league includes Georgia. \u201cWe have fans that go to 12 regular season games, conference championship game, semifinal game, and they tailgate. So we have to think differently about the opportunities at our college football championship.\u201d Tailgating is regularly allowed at SoFi Stadium, with rules and regulations that are similar to those at other stadiums. Still, the decision to not allow tailgating for fans this year came because \u201cwe have limited on-site parking at SoFi Stadium and want to ensure everyone has a safe and timely arrival for the game,\u201d Bill Hancock, the executive director of the College Football Playoff, said in a statement. Organizers also had a Playoff Fan Central open over the weekend at the Los Angeles Convention Center, with interactive games, a live sports talk show, and merchandise. But some fans said that area was much more of a challenge to find than it has been in past years.\n\n\u201cThe fan fest, if you didn\u2019t know how to do your research, most people are like, where are you going, what\u2019s going on?\u201d said Trudi Mixon, a Georgia fan who also attended last year\u2019s national championship between Georgia and Alabama. There was an official event marketed as a tailgate on Monday hosted by the College Football Playoff, named the Allstate Championship Tailgate. As fans packed into the event, huddling under tents to evade the rain and sing fight songs, missing were the R.V.s, trucks, oversized school flags and the smell of grilled food that permeates the air at a typical tailgate party. The Fiesta Bowl on Dec. 31 was T.C.U.\u2019s first bowl game since 2018 and the first bowl in person for Preston James, a 25-year T.C.U. fan and alumnus from Tulsa, Okla. James said he tailgates all of T.C.U.\u2019s games with his family and friends, and that while it was still early to compare experiences, he enjoyed the Fiesta Bowl more because of the many events and activities ahead of the game. \u201cIt was a lot nicer, I think, last week,\u201d James said, \u201cjust the whole atmosphere itself.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA cease-fire proposal seemingly aimed at splintering Western unity has instead been met with Western escalation, underscoring Moscow\u2019s diplomatic struggles.\n\nFor not the first time, Russian leaders dangled the possibility of a de-escalation of fighting in Ukraine, this time in the form of a 36-hour cease-fire that would have taken place this past weekend. But, in a pattern that is now familiar nearly a year into the war, Western and Ukrainian leaders broadly rejected the proposal, calling it a cynical effort to create space for resupplying Russian forces. Analysts typically share this view, saying that such proposals tend to come when a pause would most benefit Russia\u2019s battlefield position, not when they might further peace talks or aid civilians. Sure enough, even as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promised a unilateral pause in some areas, there was little indication of such on the ground, where fighting continued as normal.\n\nUkraine\u2019s leaders have treated the effort to deepen Western financial and military support as a front virtually as important as any on the battlefield. That support has staved off Ukrainian economic collapse, kept Ukrainian forces supplied long after they would have otherwise run out of ammunition and even helped those forces, equipped with increasingly sophisticated Western weaponry, push back once-rapid Russian advances. At the same time, Western economic sanctions on Russia are curbing its ability to wage the war and weakening Mr. Putin\u2019s position at home. Western support has, in other words, helped to turn what Mr. Putin expected to be a rapid Russian victory into a costly and uncertain slog.\n\nSo he is looking for any opportunity to break that support. This includes gestures toward diplomacy that are seemingly aimed, at least in part, at opening divisions among Western capitals, and within the domestic politics of those countries, over the war. \u201cCalls for a cease-fire, audible across Europe and America, are badly misplaced,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wrote in a New York Times guest essay in July. \u201cThis is not the time to accept unfavorable cease-fire proposals or peace deals.\u201d\n\nMoscow has sought to portray Ukrainian leaders as obstacles to peace, hoping that some European leaders or opposition parties would eventually agree. Ukrainian leaders fear, and Russian leaders hope, that this might lead some Western governments to diminish their support for Ukraine\u2019s war efforts. Or lead them to pressure Kyiv to accept a cease-fire that Moscow could use to redouble its assault. Or even to push for peace talks that, coming as Russian forces still hold large stretches of Ukraine, would probably favor Moscow\u2019s terms more so than if Ukrainian forces continued to push back the invaders. This was not an unreasonable expectation, particularly in the war\u2019s early days. In the years before the invasion last February, Western capitals had often differed over matters related to Russia. And any unified Western military policy is generally organized through NATO, and any economic policy partly through the European Union, two heavily bureaucratic organizations that seek to operate through consensus among their 30 or so member states. But so far, Western states have been seen as generally unified in backing Ukraine in the war and have even taken this support further than many analysts expected. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, had in the weeks before Russia\u2019s invasion presented himself as the intermediary between Moscow and other Western capitals. But now he has emerged as one of Ukraine\u2019s most assertive military backers. Last week Mr. Macron announced that France would deliver armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine\u2019s military. It was yet another escalation in Western military support to Ukraine and another instance of Western leaders\u2019 ignoring Russian warnings against such direct involvement.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s diplomatic team has managed to convince the allies: The time of weapons taboo has passed,\u201d Mr. Kuleba wrote in a Facebook post, referring to Ukraine\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky. Germany\u2019s participation is telling. Since World War II, its leaders have emphasized diplomacy toward Moscow, positioning themselves as counterweights to a more hawkish Washington. As Europe\u2019s largest economy and a major force within the European Union, it has often set the tempo on such matters. And German voters are considered particularly averse to the economic burdens associated with isolating Russia, which supplies much of Europe\u2019s energy. Mr. Putin has long sought to put pressure on those sensitivities, seemingly hoping that German leaders would modulate Western support for Ukraine, perhaps even splintering that coalition over, say, Russian proposals for peace talks. It is a mark of how little success Mr. Putin has found that German leaders have instead escalated their military involvement in ways that would have once been unthinkable, and not for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cIf Putin wanted peace,\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, wrote last week on Twitter in response to Russia\u2019s cease-fire proposal, \u201che would take his soldiers home and the war would be over.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHer verse examined social history through individual lives, including her own, in which she later found love. Yet for all the admiration she inspired, she was unheralded.\n\nNaomi Replansky, a self-taught American poet \u2014 for decades keenly celebrated yet curiously unheralded \u2014 whose work portrayed a world of labor, oppression and struggle but was no less hopeful for all that, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 104. Born and reared in the Bronx, and as at home on the factory floor as at a coffeehouse reading, Ms. Replansky wrote of subjects long considered no fit fare for poetry: manual labor, poverty, disenfranchisement, racism, exile and the Holocaust. Her work, critics concurred, was not so much standard protest poetry but rather a minute examination of the vicissitudes of social history through the lens of individual lives, including her own. \u201cPoetry for me,\u201d Ms. Replansky told the Jewish feminist journal Bridges in 2002, \u201cis a way of mastering the world.\u201d\n\nIn its settings and sensibilities, Ms. Replansky\u2019s work married the vernacular blue-collar world of the former United States poet laureate Philip Levine, who often acknowledged his debt to her, to the leftist New York Jewish milieu of the short-story writer Grace Paley, a longtime friend. \u201cNo other North American poet I\u2019ve read has been able to incorporate the fire and brilliance of Latin American surrealism in original work of such startling authority,\u201d Mr. Levine wrote of Ms. Replansky in The Los Angeles Times in 2003, adding, \u201cAnd a lot of us have tried.\u201d Critics lauded Ms. Replansky\u2019s poetry for its translucent, plain-spoken language and impeccably worked-out, songlike cadences that recall the oral verse of old. Her acknowledged influences \u2014 among them William Blake, Emily Dickinson, children\u2019s street chants and English and Scottish folk ballads \u2014 can be readily discerned. Consider, here in its entirety, her stark, powerful poem \u201cEpitaph: 1945,\u201d written after the atomic bombing of Japan by the United States: My spoon was lifted when the bomb came down\n\nThat left no face, no hand, no spoon to hold.\n\nA hundred thousand died in my home town.\n\nThis came to pass before my soup was cold. Yet to the end of her long life, Ms. Replansky remained far less well known than Ms. Paley, who died in 2007, or Mr. Levine, who died in 2015.\n\nShe had only two major volumes of poetry to her name in the 60 years preceding the release, by Black Sparrow/David R. Godine, of her \u201cCollected Poems\u201d in 2012. Before Ms. Replansky\u2019s \u201cCollected Poems\u201d was released in 2012, she had published just two major volumes of poetry. \u201cNaomi Replansky must be counted among the most brilliant American poets,\u201d the poet George Oppen said in the early 1980s. \u201cThat she has not received adequate praise is one of the major mysteries of the world of poetry.\u201d The solution to the mystery hinged on several things. For one, Ms. Replansky, a perfectionist, would cede no poem until it shone like a mirror; she thus published rarely. For another, there was the disruptive necessity of earning a living, for although Ms. Replansky was long in the world of poetry, she was in many respects not of it, working variously as a lathe operator, an ocean-liner stewardess, a medical editor and a computer programmer in the punch-card age. A 1953 work, \u201cFactory Poem,\u201d whose alternating four- and three-beat lines and A-B-C-B rhyme scheme echo the structure of many old British ballads, begins: The tool-bit cut, the metal curled,\n\nThe oil soaked through her clothing.\n\nShe made six hundred parts a day\n\nAnd timed herself by breathing. What was more, the subject matter of Ms. Replansky\u2019s work, which also included celebrations of sexual love between women (published in at least one anthology as early as the 1930s), discomforted some critics.\n\nFinally, much of her poetry made meticulous use of rhyme, which by the mid-20th century was disdained by the poetic establishment as inimical to the making of serious art. Ms. Replansky persevered, continuing to write through lean times, sporadic critical hostility and the rigors of aging, a fitting response for a poet whose work is ultimately about resilience. It seems fitting, too, that she chose to wield rhyme and meter, the most conservative of poetic devices, in the service of ideological radicalism \u2014 an act of subversion if ever there was one. Tongue-tied, I stand before\n\nMyself as inquisitor.\n\nI loved to mark time\n\nWith a beat, with rhyme. Time marked me with its thumb, Slowed down the pendulum.\n\nSlowed it down or stopped: Words were lopped, words dropped \u2014\n\nNo use to devise Reasons or alibis.\n\nNow, strangely, I draw breath Well past my ninetieth.\n\nWhat\u2019s begun is almost done, Still I must brood upon\n\nThe much that I sought, The little that I wrought,\n\nTill Time brings its own Lockjaw of stone. The daughter of Sol and Fannie (Ginsberg) Replansky, Naomi Replansky was born in the Bronx on May 23, 1918. Her father was often unemployed, and her mother supported the family as best she could through secretarial work and by giving private English lessons to new immigrants. \u201cFive dollars, four dollars, three dollars, two,\n\nOne, and none, and what do we do?\u201d\n\nThis is the worry that never got said\n\nBut ran so often in my mother\u2019s head.\n\nAnd showed so plain in my father\u2019s frown\n\nThat to us kids it drifted down.\n\nIt drifted down like soot, like snow,\n\nIn the dream-tossed Bronx, in the long ago.\n\nI shook it off with a shake of the head.\n\nI bounced my ball, I ate warm bread.\n\nI skated down the steepest hill.\n\nBut I must have listened, against my will:\n\nWhen the wind blows wrong, I can hear it today.\n\nThen my mother\u2019s worry stops all play\n\nAnd, as if in its rightful place,\n\nMy father\u2019s frown divides my face.\n\nAfter graduating from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, Ms. Replansky attended Hunter College in Manhattan, studying history, but left before graduating to go to work. Years later, in the 1950s, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in geography from the University of California, Los Angeles. Her first collection, \u201cRing Song,\u201d appeared in 1952. Though Ms. Replansky was in her 30s when it was published, the poems it contained had been written in her teens. A finalist for a National Book Award, \u201cRing Song\u201d drew critical praise from many quarters. But it received a caustic review in The San Francisco Chronicle by Lawrence Ferling \u2014 better known afterward by his family\u2019s original name, Ferlinghetti, which he resumed in the mid-1950s. Chastened by his review, Ms. Replansky did not publish another significant volume until 1994, when her collection \u201cThe Dangerous World\u201d was released. (A chapbook, \u201cTwenty-one Poems, Old and New,\u201d appeared in 1988.) Ms. Replansky lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco over the years before moving to the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where she made her home to the end of her life. She would dearly have loved to have settled in Paris, she said, but throughout the 1950s she was unable to leave the United States; the State Department, evidently moved by her leftist ideology, revoked her passport.\n\nIn Los Angeles, where she lived at midcentury, Ms. Replansky befriended Bertolt Brecht, whose work, including the play \u201cSt. Joan of the Stockyards,\u201d she translated from German. She also translated the Austrian poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal and, from Yiddish, the poet and playwright Itzik Manger. Ms. Replansky taught poetry at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., and the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan. In the 1980s, the writer and literary scholar Eva Kollisch became her companion, and the two married in 2009. In addition to her stepson, Mr. Berliner, Ms. Replansky is survived by Ms. Kollisch and a step-grandson. Ms. Replansky enjoyed some recognition late in life. She received the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America in 2013. A profile published by The New York Times in 2020 heralded her and Ms. Kollisch\u2019s \u201cfearlessness\u201d confronting misfortune throughout their lives, including confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. If Ms. Replansky\u2019s work was suffused with loss and longing, it was also rarely devoid of hope. This was perhaps nowhere more evident than in her poem \u201cThe Oasis,\u201d about finding love late in life, as she did with Ms. Kollisch. I thought I held a fruit cupped in my hand.\n\nIts sweetness burst\n\nAnd loosed its juice. After long traveling,\n\nAfter so long a thirst, I asked myself:\n\nIs this a drought-born dream?\n\nIt was no dream. I thought I slipped into a hidden room\n\nOut of harsh light.\n\nIn cushioned dark, among rich furnishings,\n\nThere I restored my sight.\n\nSuch luxury could never be for me!\n\nIt was for me. I thought I touched a mind that fitted mine\n\nAs bodies fit,\n\nAngle to curve; and my mind throbbed to feel\n\nThe pulsing of that wit.\n\nThis comes too late, I said. It can\u2019t be true!\n\nBut it was true. I thought the desert ended, and I felt\n\nThe fountains leap.\n\nThen gratitude could answer gratitude\n\nTill sleep entwined with sleep.\n\nDespair once cried: No passion\u2019s left inside!\n\nIt lied. It lied.",

Are you simply curious about the world around you? Or something else?\n\nDo these goals make school and learning enjoyable and meaningful for you? Or do they make it stressful?\n\nIn the guest essay \u201cThe Key to Success in College Is So Simple, It\u2019s Almost Never Mentioned,\u201d Jonathan Malesic, who teaches writing at the University of Texas at Dallas, shares one way that students can get the most out of their education:\n\nFor Emily Zurek Small, college did what it\u2019s supposed to do. Growing up in a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania, she had career and intellectual ambitions for which college is the clearest pathway. \u201cI just kind of always wanted to learn,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cI wanted to be able to have intelligent conversations with people and know about the world.\u201d She enrolled at a small nearby Catholic college, majored in neuroscience and in 2016 became the first person in her family to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 and later, a master\u2019s. She now works as a school psychologist in Virginia. I saw Ms. Zurek Small\u2019s education up close, in two theology classes I taught during my 11 years as a professor at the college she attended. She was a good student, but what struck me more than her ability was the fact that she cared. Being in class, asking questions and exploring ideas meant something to her. One reason she cared was that she was paying her own way and was thus amply aware of her education\u2019s cost. \u201cIf I was not engaging, I was just throwing money out the window,\u201d she said. That engagement helped her realize that her \u201cthoughts and opinions matter.\u201d As universities in much of the country suffer declining enrollment, they need to make the broader case for going to college even as they debate how best to help students learn after Covid disruptions. How should universities carry out remote learning? How should they teach writing in the age of artificial intelligence? How difficult should it be to pass organic chemistry? But there\u2019s an equally important question that only students can answer: What will they do to get the most out of college? It\u2019s their education, after all. One of the most important factors in Ms. Zurek Small\u2019s success seems almost too obvious to mention but, in fact, deserves far more attention and discussion: a simple willingness to learn. In more than 20 years of college teaching, I have seen that students who are open to new knowledge will learn. Students who aren\u2019t won\u2019t. But this attitude is not fixed. The paradoxical union of intellectual humility and ambition is something that every student can (with help from teachers, counselors and parents) and should cultivate. It\u2019s what makes learning possible. The willingness to learn is related to the growth mind-set \u2014 the belief that your abilities are not fixed but can improve. But there is a key difference: This willingness is a belief not primarily about the self but about the world. It\u2019s a belief that every class offers something worthwhile, even if you don\u2019t know in advance what that something is.\n\nStudents, read the entire essay, and then tell us:\n\u2022 None What do you think of Mr. Malesic\u2019s argument that \u201ca simple willingness to learn\u201d is the key to success in school? Have you experienced this in your own life? If so, share an example.\n\u2022 None Take a moment to think back on your schooling. When have you been most engaged in a class? What do you think excited you about it?\n\u2022 None Does it ever feel difficult to keep your interest and attention on what you\u2019re learning? How do you motivate yourself in such situations?\n\u2022 None Mr. Malesic writes that \u201cschool should cultivate students\u2019 curiosity and let them feel the thrill of finding something out.\u201d To what degree do you agree with this statement? Have your teachers tried to cultivate students\u2019 curiosity and the thrill of learning? Do you think young people are open to this?\n\u2022 None He also includes challenges that keep more students from being like Emily Zurek Small: careerism and knowingness. Have these things ever gotten in the way of your learning? If so, tell us how.\n\u2022 None If you go to college, you\u2019ll probably have to take classes that are not related to your major. What do you think about that? Do you have classes now that you don\u2019t feel are relevant to your future?

            "content": "In \u201cThe Wandering Mind,\u201d the historian Jamie Kreiner shows that the struggle to focus is not just a digital-age blight but afflicted even those who spent their lives in seclusion and prayer.\n\nTHE WANDERING MIND: What Medieval Monks Tell Us About Distraction, by Jamie Kreiner Among the resources that have been plundered by modern technology, the ruins of our attention have commanded a lot of attention. We can\u2019t focus anymore. Getting any \u201cdeep work\u201d done requires formidable willpower or a broken modem. Reading has degenerated into skimming and scrolling. The only real way out is to adopt a meditation practice and cultivate a monkish existence. But in actual historical fact, a life of prayer and seclusion has never meant a life without distraction. As Jamie Kreiner puts it in her new book, \u201cThe Wandering Mind,\u201d the monks of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages (around A.D. 300 to 900) struggled mightily with attention. Connecting one\u2019s mind to God was no easy task. The goal was \u201cclearsighted calm above the chaos,\u201d Kreiner writes. John of Dalyatha, an eighth-century monk who lived in what is now northern Iraq, lamented in a letter to his brother, \u201cAll I do is eat, sleep, drink and be negligent.\u201d Kreiner, a historian at the University of Georgia, organizes the book around the various sources of distraction that a Christian monk had to face, from \u201cthe world\u201d to the smaller \u201ccommunity,\u201d all the way down to \u201cmemory\u201d and the \u201cmind.\u201d Abandoning the familiar and profane was only the first step in what would turn out to be an unrelenting process \u2014 though as Kreiner explains, many monks continued to reside at home, committing themselves to lives of renunciation and prayer. For the monks who did leave, there were any number of possibilities beyond the confines of a monastery, which could pose its own distractions. Caves and deserts were obvious alternatives. Macedonius \u201cthe Pit\u201d was partial to holes in the ground. Frange dwelled in a pharaoh\u2019s tomb. Simeon, a \u201cstylite,\u201d lived on top of a pillar.\n\nSimeon was also known for resisting another source of distraction: the body. Monks were supposed to pray standing up, with their arms outstretched, in order to fend off the temptations of sleep; Simeon took this activity to such an extreme that even when one of his feet became terribly infected, his powers of concentration apparently never flagged. (Kreiner mentions an \u201cexuberant metrical homily\u201d that described, or perhaps imagined, Simeon cutting off his own foot and continuing to pray while standing on his remaining leg, telling his amputated limb that they would be reunited in the afterlife.) For the monk seeking oneness with God, the body was an encumbrance. After all, Kreiner notes, \u201cangels were pure consciousness.\u201d As the sixth-century desert father Dorotheos said of his body, \u201cIt is killing me, I am killing it.\u201d\n\nNot that such extremism amounted to a consensus view. Kreiner shows that monastic practices varied widely, reflecting a diversity of perspectives and disagreements. Almost every exhortation to do something seemed to provoke a warning not to take it too far. Elites who converted to monasticism had to be reminded of the need to dress shabbily and forgo the cologne, but \u201cunkemptness could become its own distraction,\u201d Kreiner says, with a monk \u201cfeeling vain about his griminess.\u201d Virtually the only point of agreement among the monks in Kreiner\u2019s book was a profound suspicion (at least officially) of sex and sleep. Books, too, were double-edged, offering both distraction and clarification. They could be edifying, offering monks a way to absorb sacred texts. They could serve more practical purposes, preventing monks \u201cfrom chatting in church before the services started,\u201d Kreiner writes, in one of her characteristically congenial formulations. Of course, it mattered not only what one read but also how one read. Monks were encouraged to read slowly and methodically, and they engaged with the text by writing notes in the margin. Kreiner says this marginalia helped them \u201cto stay alert\u201d \u2014 though she also concedes that sometimes what they scribbled down had nothing to do with the text at hand. An image from a copy of Priscian\u2019s Latin grammar includes a note in Old Irish that reads lathaerit, or \u201cmassive hangover.\u201d While the world may have represented \u201centanglement,\u201d Kreiner writes, monks recognized a simple fact: \u201cDistraction is inherent in the experience of being human.\u201d Ever since Adam and Eve the unity between humanity and God had been fractured. Kreiner says that the narrative of distraction and decline is very old \u2014 far older than current anxieties over what the digital age has done to our brains. Even prayer, which was supposed to be \u201cthe ideal state of attentiveness,\u201d wasn\u2019t enough to crowd out other thoughts. A monk might achieve the sublime stillness of revelation, but this was only temporary, and in the next moment the mind would revert to its old distractible ways.\n\nAt one point Kreiner mentions that she has taught freshmen various \u201cmedieval cognitive practices\u201d \u2014 including meditation and mnemonic techniques to visualize connections among academic concepts \u2014 in order to help them fully engage with what they are learning in their other classes. The method \u201cbasically amounts to high-level studying,\u201d she says, \u201cbut rather than being boring or intimidating, it\u2019s adventurous and immersive.\u201d Monks were determined not only to discipline the mind but also to work with it, accommodating some of its foibles and idiosyncrasies, because they saw concentration \u201cas a matter of eternal life and death.\u201d Swap out \u201ceternal life and death\u201d for the bland mantras of \u201cproductivity\u201d and you\u2019ll get a sense of how the stakes for monks were quite different from ours. The subtitle of \u201cThe Wandering Mind\u201d is \u201cWhat Medieval Monks Tell Us About Distraction,\u201d which is a tantalizing, if somewhat misleading, proposition. This is a charming and peculiar book. I can\u2019t blame Kreiner for using the cultural obsession with distractibility to train our focus elsewhere, guiding us from the starting point of our own preoccupations to a greater understanding of how monks lived.

Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\u2019s pioneering restaurant in Copenhagen announced Monday that 2024 would be the final year it will be open for regular business, as it transforms itself into a different kind of enterprise, Noma 3.0. Tables for farewell meals at Noma 2.0 will no doubt be next to impossible to book, but that\u2019s been the story for years. I piggybacked on an old colleague\u2019s reservation when I wrote about Noma in 2018, two months after the restaurant assumed its current shape and location. By that time, though, Noma had already been in New York City for years. It was here in the one-bite appetizers of reindeer lichen and puffed fish skin, although they weren\u2019t called appetizers, or amuses, either \u2014 suddenly they were \u201csnacks.\u201d Noma was here in the signal-orange berries of wild sea buckthorn that had begun turning up in cocktails, jams, sauces and cheese courses. It was here in the sour, heart-shaped leaves of wood sorrel and other plants that Mr. Redzepi and his cooks picked, snipped and dug up in their search for the building blocks of a strictly regional cuisine following the principles of the New Nordic manifesto.\n\nIt was here in the slates, rocks, seashells, logs and rustic pieces of hand-thrown pottery that had started to replace delicate French porcelain as the preferred objects for transporting food from the kitchen to the table. It was here in the bony, opaque, angular, off-center, unpredictable, odd-smelling wines made in the Jura and the Loire and elsewhere by natural and biodynamic methods \u2014 bottles that had been cult items in France for years but had rocketed to global prominence when Pontus Elofsson, Noma\u2019s first wine director, made them the near-exclusive focus of his list. The renowned Copenhagen restaurant, repeatedly rated among the world\u2019s best, will close for regular service at the end of 2024.\n\u2022 None An \u2018Unsustainable\u2019 Model: The chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, Noma\u2019s creator, says fine dining at the highest level, with its grueling hours and intense workplace culture, The chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, Noma\u2019s creator, says fine dining at the highest level, with its grueling hours and intense workplace culture, has hit a breaking point\n\u2022 None A World of Imitators: \u201cI don\u2019t think any restaurant came up with so many ideas that were shoplifted by so many other places in so many other cities quite so quickly,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think any restaurant came up with so many ideas that were shoplifted by so many other places in so many other cities quite so quickly,\u201d our food critic writes of Noma\n\u2022 None Inside Noma: In 2018, our critic went to Copenhagen to eat at the pioneering restaurant. In 2018, our critic went to Copenhagen to eat at the pioneering restaurant. Here\u2019s what he learned\n\u2022 None Q&A: After a series of pop-ups in Mexico, Australia and Japan brought Mr. Redzepi even more acclaim in the food world, After a series of pop-ups in Mexico, Australia and Japan brought Mr. Redzepi even more acclaim in the food world, he told us what he really wants is to go on vacation with his family These and other Noma-isms began washing up on New York City\u2019s shores not long after 2010, when the restaurant was voted best in the world by a British magazine using a methodology that was itself fairly opaque, off-center and odd-smelling.\n\nOther restaurants \u2014 El Bulli, for example, and Chez Panisse \u2014 have been widely imitated. But I don\u2019t think any restaurant came up with so many ideas that were shoplifted by so many other places in so many other cities quite so quickly. Noma invented a lot of bits, and they got around. At times these bits could look like mannerisms in search of a manner. Early on, especially from 2012 to 2015, chefs were copying things Mr. Redzepi did without understanding why he did them in the first place. For a while, when you walked into a brand-new dining room in New York with a modern Scandinavian look, you could predict with confidence that you were not going to be eating any tomatoes that night. The reason? They don\u2019t grow well in Denmark, so Noma doesn\u2019t serve them. Forming an idea of the real Noma from all these distant echoes, I was like somebody who had never seen Michael Jackson, trying to imagine what his concerts were like based on seeing a subway performer moonwalk. And then I went to Copenhagen and, by the end of a two- or three-hour lunch, all the Noma-isms fit together like puzzle pieces to form one whole picture. The restaurant that had inspired so many imitators was fluid, it was graceful, it was coherent.\n\nAnd I discovered the flavors of Noma. Some unprepossessing liquid that looked as if it had simply seeped out of a clam or mussel would turn out to be a sauce full of pleasure and complexity that would come at you in rolling waves. The next course would do it again, but in a different key at another volume. Feats like that, repeated in variations that never become dull, are what make Mr. Redzepi a great chef and not just a sculptor working with materials that go bad after a few days. I ate that day with Jeff Gordinier, a former Times reporter who was finishing a book about his adventures with Mr. Redzepi (\u201cHungry: Eating, Road-Tripping and Risking It All With the Greatest Chef in the World\u201d). At the end of lunch we were given a tour of the compound. The fermentation suite was full of jars of grains and yeasts and fruits whose molecules were breaking down and rearranging. The research and development laboratory was ready for new discoveries. The greenhouse was under construction. Mr. Redzepi explained that the architecture was modular. Any building, any room, could be repurposed in the future. Even the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re in here for life,\u201d he told Mr. Gordinier. \u201cBut we\u2019re not in here for one thing. It can change.\u201d I did not guess that Mr. Redzepi would one day decide to reinvent Noma as something other than a restaurant. But I can\u2019t quite say I\u2019ll be sorry when it\u2019s gone, either. In many ways, its excellence had become inseparable from the culture of overkill that now defines the windswept high peaks of fine dining.\n\nThe competition to be \u201cthe world\u2019s best restaurant\u201d \u2014 a meaningless title, but one that has an irresistible pull for chefs and headline writers \u2014 has distorted cooking, warped service, inflated check totals, padded menus and stolen hours from customers\u2019 lives and many, many more hours from the lives of chefs and their workers, whether paid or unpaid. Most of the overkill restaurants could not last a week without free labor. Once he gets rid of those pesky diners, Mr. Redzepi apparently means to focus Noma on research and development of new products that he could sell. Maybe he could ask a small team of scientists to look into ways to shrink great dining experiences, like the one Noma gives its lucky diners, down to a size that is both more human and more humane.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe wounded teacher went to the school office and said \u201ccall 911\u201d before collapsing, a witness said.\n\nNEWPORT NEWS, Va. \u2014 Abigail Zwerner was in the middle of a routine lesson at Richneck Elementary School last week when, the police said, a boy in her class, just 6 years old, pulled out a handgun at his desk, pointed it at his teacher and fired. At a news conference on Monday, officials said it was not an accident and appeared to be an intentional shooting. The boy brought the gun from home, the authorities said, before aiming it at his teacher. When the shot was fired, Ms. Zwerner threw up her hand, but the bullet passed through it and struck her chest. Though badly wounded, she sent the students in her class, as many as 20 children, scrambling into the hallway, while another employee rushed into the room and restrained the 6-year-old, the authorities said. Only then did Ms. Zwerner, 25, stagger into the hallway and toward the office to find help. But first, the police said, she paused and looked back.\n\n\u201cShe turned around to make sure that every one of those students was safe,\u201d said Steve Drew, the chief of police in Newport News, Va., who described Ms. Zwerner\u2019s actions as heroic and said she was in stable condition. \u201cI believe she did save lives, because I don\u2019t know what else might have happened.\u201d Even as school shootings become more common, it is exceptionally rare for a child so young to be accused, and the case has raised a host of complex questions. Virginia law prohibits leaving a loaded gun where it is accessible to children under 14, a crime that is punishable as a misdemeanor. But unlike some other states, such as Oregon and Massachusetts, there is not a broad law that requires all guns to be safely stored in homes. The authorities offered on Monday the first account of how the child obtained the gun, saying that the weapon, a 9-millimeter Taurus handgun, came from his home and that it had been legally purchased by his mother. \u201cThe child had obtained that firearm, placed it in his backpack and brought it to school,\u201d Chief Drew said, citing interviews with the child and his mother. Chief Drew said that any potential charges would be based on \u201cwhat the facts are and what the law supports.\u201d\n\nThe focus in elementary schools had been on preventing adult active shooters from entering classrooms, Mr. Parker said. But now, he said, some steps taken at high schools, like metal detectors, may need to be explored. \u201cI hate to be at this point where I\u2019m considering this, but we have to start relying on those types of deterrence at the elementary level as well,\u201d said Mr. Parker, who seemed distressed to even be thinking about such measures. \u201cMy board members know how I feel about making our schools look anything like a prison,\u201d he added. \u201cI want our schools to be great places to educate children.\u201d But, he said, \u201cif we can\u2019t maintain safety, or at least get to the point where we can have an effective and safe school day, kids won\u2019t learn anyway.\u201d\n\nMany districts have tried to increase security in recent years, but efforts are typically concentrated in older grades, federal data shows. Nearly 15 percent of high schools had random metal detector checks, compared with less than 2 percent of elementary schools in the 2019-2020 school year, the most recent year for which data was available, according to the National Center of Education Statistics. About 7 to 9 percent of middle and high schools required backpacks to be clear or banned them, compared with about 2 percent of elementary schools.More than 80 percent of high schools reported employing at least one security staff member, compared with about 55 percent of elementary schools. But experts caution that the \u201chardening\u201d of schools is not reliably effective at preventing gun violence and can affect students\u2019 perception of their safety. \u201cThe research consistently indicates that none of the school hardening procedures, including metal detectors, prevent school shootings,\u201d Elizabeth Anthony, an associate professor at Arizona State University who studies school safety and child trauma, said in an email. She noted that metal detectors had been found to \u201creduce the amount of contraband, but not directly prevent gun violence.\u201d The hardening of schools also comes with considerable risks, she added, including to Black and Hispanic children \u201cwho are already surveilled more frequently than their white peers.\u201d Metal detectors and clear backpacks are more common in schools where a large majority of students are children of color, according to federal data.\n\nRichneck Elementary serves more than 550 students; more than half of them are Black and Hispanic, and about a quarter are white. It listed a security officer on its website. Several experts pointed to counseling and mental health support as a better investment for schools, and said officials must also look outside of schools to prevent violence. Jagdish Khubchandani, a professor of public health at New Mexico State University who has studied school violence, pointed to research that found that children under 10 were as likely as older children to know where guns were stored in the home. Another study found that 70 percent of 5- to 6-year olds, and 90 percent of 7- to 8-year-olds had enough finger strength to pull the trigger. \u201cThe children know where the guns are and how they are stored,\u201d he said. There were still many unknowns in the Virginia case, including how exactly the gun had gotten into the hands of the child, or how it had been stored. Dan Semenza, the director of interpersonal violence research at the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers University, said that the safest way to prevent children from using guns \u201cis to not have a firearm in the home of a child.\u201d Still, he said, there were ways to limit access even with guns in the home. \u201cYou are talking about a gun locker or a gun safe, where the firearm is separate from the ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cEven more safe would be having some kind of lock that is biometric,\u201d he added, so that only a particular individual could access it, similar to using face or finger technology to log into a cellphone. One effective, trusted place to provide education on these safety measures is pediatricians\u2019 offices, which nearly all families visit, he said. \u201cIf the pediatrician feels comfortable asking: \u2018Do you have a firearm in the house? Do you have access to a safe storage mechanism?\u2019\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s more preventative.\u201d\n\nThe boy struck the employee but did not fire another shot, the police said. The gun, which still held bullets, was on the floor when the police arrived. In the front office, school officials were busy ordering a schoolwide lockdown, having just been told that a shooting had taken place in one of the first-grade classrooms, said Lowanda Sample-Rusk, 55, who was there to pick up her 5- and 7-year-old grandchildren. Before the office itself was locked, Ms. Zwerner showed up at the door. \u201cShe said: \u2018Call 911. I\u2019ve been shot,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sample-Rusk recalled. \u201cAnd then she fainted.\u201d Ms. Sample-Rusk and others in the office immediately ran to Ms. Zwerner and began administering first aid, seeing blood on Ms. Zwerner\u2019s hand but trying to \u201cfind out where the gunshot wound was.\u201d They found that Ms. Zwerner had been shot in the chest, and Ms. Sample-Rusk applied pressure to the wound until the police came.\n\nJohn Eley III, a member of the Newport News City Council, said that Ms. Zwerner was a well-respected educator who \u201cwent beyond the call of duty to make sure all her children\u2019s needs were met.\u201d She comes from a family of educators, he said. \u201cEverybody had nothing but great things to say about her, her leadership and her ability to be a great teacher,\u201d said Mr. Eley, who served for six years on the Newport News School Board before becoming a City Council member. A series of school shootings over less than two years in Newport News has exacted a heavy toll on the community, Mr. Eley said. In September 2021, two 17-year-olds were injured in a shooting at Heritage High School; two months later, a 17-year-old was killed outside Menchville High School. \u201cIt\u2019s just tragic we\u2019re having to deal with this all over again,\u201d Mr. Eley said. Speaking at the news conference on Monday, Chief Drew seemed at a loss for words when asked how a 6-year-old boy knew how to use a firearm. \u201cThat is a great question, and I wish we never had to have it asked,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that.\u201d",

The case before the justices, In re Grand Jury, No. 21-1397, was itself shrouded in secrecy. It involved a criminal investigation of an unnamed person described in court papers as \u201can early promoter of Bitcoin\u201d who \u201cexpatriated from the United States in early 2014.\u201d After a grand jury sought records from an unnamed law firm hired to prepare that person\u2019s tax returns, a federal judge ordered the firm to turn over documents that contained both legal advice and ordinary tax-return accounting unless the legal advice was the document\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose.\u201d The firm refused, saying that the documents should be protected so long as legal advice was a \u201csubstantial purpose\u201d of the communication. The judge held the firm in contempt, an appeals court agreed that the tougher \u201cprimary purpose\u201d standard should apply, and the firm appealed to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to let it withhold documents in which legal advice played a subsidiary but significant role.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep in mind what the judges have to do here, which is go through these documents,\u201d he told Ms. Hansford, adding that \u201cit seems to me that your approach really puts a lot of work on the judge.\u201d Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said both sides had shifted their positions during the litigation.

            "content": "Election signs urging members of the Haredi community to vote for ultra-Orthodox parties in November in Bnei Brak, Israel.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nBolstered by growth in numbers and political influence, ultra-Orthodox parties are pushing for greater autonomy, with potentially far-reaching implications for the country.\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 To preserve his new government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is making significant concessions to far-right political parties on Palestinian issues, judicial independence and police powers, but also less noticed moves on behalf of another key member of his coalition: parties that represent the fast-growing ultra-Orthodox public. Members of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community have long enjoyed benefits unavailable to many other Israeli citizens: exemption from army service for Torah students, government stipends for those choosing full-time religious study over work and separate schools that receive state funds even though their curriculums barely teach government-mandated subjects. Those benefits have fueled resentment among large segments of the more secular public, and Israeli leaders have declared for years that their intention was to draw more of the ultra-Orthodox, known as Haredim, into the work force and society. But the string of promises by Mr. Netanyahu in recent weeks as he pulled together the country\u2019s most right-wing and religiously conservative government ever suggest that Haredi leaders are pushing hard to cement the community\u2019s special status, with broad-ranging implications for Israeli society and the economy.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has promised ultra-Orthodox leaders a new, separate city for Haredim where the Haredi lifestyle would guide planning. He has agreed to increase funding for Haredi seminary students and provide access to government jobs without university degrees. And he has pledged a wide range of government handouts for the Haredi school system. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the Haredi leadership that sewed up these agreements is going for strengthening the Haredi autonomy and not integration,\u201d said Prof. Yedidia Stern, president of the Jewish People Policy Institute, an independent research center. The departing finance minister, Avigdor Liberman, a staunch critic of the Haredi parties, said the cost of all of the additional promised funding for Haredi causes would come to an estimated 20 billion shekels (about $5.7 billion) a year and constituted \u201can attempt to collapse the Israeli economy.\u201d\n\nMost Haredi women have jobs, albeit often low-paying ones. But only about half of ultra-Orthodox men go to work. Critics say that the promise to increase stipends for Torah students will act as a disincentive for them to join the labor force. Haredi children now make up a quarter of all Jewish children in the school system and a fifth of all pupils in the country, Jewish and Arab. Most Haredi boys focus on religious studies and learn little or no math, English or science. \u201cWhen the Haredim were a small group, that was OK,\u201d Professor Stern said. \u201cNow it\u2019s impossible. To allow this to go on despite the large numbers of Haredim means the country won\u2019t be able to function.\u201d In order to increase at least one area of employment for Haredim \u2014 their representation in public authorities and corporations \u2014 a university degree will no longer be a criterion for some, mostly unspecified jobs. (One of the few examples cited was for art therapists, who are much in demand but in short supply in the ultra-Orthodox community.) Diplomas like those given out to graduates of post-high school religious seminaries for women will be considered as equivalent to a university degree, as will five years of work experience. At present, the vast majority of ultra-Orthodox high school graduates do not meet the minimum university entry requirements. Torah study will be formally recognized as higher education, and yeshiva students will get the same 50 percent discount on public transportation as university students.\n\nThe new concessions agreed to by Mr. Netanyahu \u2014 including proposals to restrict the Law of Return, which currently grants refuge and automatic citizenship to foreign Jews, their spouses and descendants who have at least one Jewish grandparent \u2014 are already straining Israel\u2019s ties with many in the Jewish diaspora. More than half of the country\u2019s Haredim live in Jerusalem or Bnei Brak, just east of Tel Aviv, or in ultra-Orthodox suburbs of those cities, according to the annual statistical survey of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, and poverty rates are higher than among the general population. Haredim make up some 13 percent of the population, but Haredi families have an average of seven children, more than double the number of the average Israeli family. If current trends continue, almost one in four Israelis, and about one in three Israeli Jews, are projected to be Haredi by 2050. Another significant pledge by Mr. Netanyahu to the Haredi parties would allow rabbinical courts to arbitrate in civil matters if both sides in a dispute agree, meaning that some work disputes, for example, could be settled according to ancient religious law. Secular Israelis have been alarmed by other Haredi demands they view as further encroachment in the public sphere, including demands for more gender-segregated beaches to comply with modesty rules. Yitzhak Pindrus, a senior representative of the United Torah Judaism alliance, made up of two Haredi parties, sought to play down the concerns, saying that nothing had changed in the Haredi mind-set.\n\nThe coalition agreements for the new government \u201clay the foundations for the two-state solution: the state of Israel and the state of the Shtetl,\u201d wrote Eliyahu Berkovits, a Haredi research assistant at the Israel Democracy Institute, in a recent article, using the Yiddish word for the traditional Jewish villages of Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. The \u201cHaredi enclave\u201d has grown much larger, he wrote, and \u201cis set to go one step further and become an autonomous state.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Berkovits said that Haredi politicians still acted as if they were representing a small minority that needed to protect its own interests. \u201cThe Haredi community has to understand that we are bigger,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are responsible for the future of Israel.\u201d\n\nHe said he was proud of his community and praised its \u201camazing values.\u201d But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s easier to do what you have done for past 20 years than to rethink the whole thing.\u201d While the numbers of modern, working Haredim are increasing, so are the hard-core and extremist factions. In recent weeks, extremists in Jerusalem vandalized an optical store because it used pictures of women wearing spectacles in its advertising and rioted over the arrest of a Haredi suspected of setting fire to a cellphone store, critically wounding a mother of 11 who was hit by a burning dumpster. The Haredi approach over the years was one of \u201cexile mentality,\u201d said Israel Cohen, a political commentator for Kol Berama, a Haredi radio station, and was about remaining apart rather than trying to influence general society. A \u201cHaredi-Israeli culture\u201d has now grown up, he said, and \u201cHaredim want Israel to be more Jewish.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019d think a Haredi becoming more Israeli would become more liberal. But no, it\u2019s the opposite. They want Israel to become more Haredi.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nEarnings season kicks off this week, and analysts expect a big drop in corporate profits and more announcements about layoffs.\n\nStocks may have eked out gains so far in the new year, but don\u2019t be fooled. With corporate earnings season kicking off this week, Wall Street is pricing in a rough quarter ahead \u2014 including for itself, with Goldman Sachs reportedly planning its biggest ever round of layoffs. \u201cDowngrades will be a key driver of the first quarter and especially this earnings season,\u201d Joachim Klement, a market analyst at Liberum Capital in London, told DealBook. A slowing economy, stubbornly high inflation and the Fed\u2019s continued policy of raising interest rates will probably mean that profits at S&P 500 companies, as a whole, will fall by 10 percent this year, Liberum predicts. \u201cI expect a lot of downward guidance for 2023 from all kinds of companies as we head towards recession,\u201d he added. Wall Street analysts have already begun trimming their earnings forecasts. According to FactSet, analysts last quarter cut their full-year 2023 earnings-per-share forecasts by 4.4 percent, to $230.51. That represents the biggest downgrade since 2014. Energy and financial companies may be hit the most, according to Mr. Klement, with the finance sector likely to see earnings per share fall 12 percent year-on-year. On Friday, investors will be closely watching for this when a parade of banking giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, report fourth-quarter results.\n\nThe banks will provide insight into the health of companies and consumers \u2014 and the labor market, too. Slowdowns in deal-making, I.P.O.s, and corporate and mortgage lending are eating into banks\u2019 bottom lines. According to news reports, Goldman will announce 3,200 job cuts this week, mainly in its trading and banking units. As The Times reported last month, bonuses are on the block, too. Payouts at Wall Street\u2019s largest banks are expected to drop as much as half from last year. There are glimmers of hope after this quarter. If the Fed begins to ease up on interest-rate increases, leading to falling bond yields, stocks could rebound in the second half of the year. Equity prices are historically 10 times more sensitive to bond yields than they are to earnings, Mr. Klement said. If that holds true, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility we see quite a rally \u2014 if not the end of the bear market in 2023.\u201d Brazilian authorities reclaim capital from supporters of Jair Bolsonaro. In scenes reminiscent of the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol, thousands stormed government buildings in Bras\u00edlia, falsely claiming the country\u2019s Oct. 30 presidential election was stolen. Some 300 people have been arrested; Bolsonaro, who is believed to be staying in Florida, criticized the protests but rejected any responsibility for the riot.\n\nThe big question: Does Mr. McCarthy have the power to keep the more hard-line elements of his party from sabotaging plans to fund the government and keeping the country from defaulting on the trillions it owes? Raising the debt ceiling is \u201cnonnegotiable,\u201d asserts the G.O.P.\u2019s ultraconservative wing. To win over holdouts in the House Freedom Caucus, Mr. McCarthy struck a series of concessions that include opening debate on spending bills and vows not to raise the debt limit without major cuts to the likes of Social Security and Medicare. The negotiating \u2014 which involved literal jostling at times \u2014 could be a preview of the chaos to come. And corporate America could see this up close. Some Republicans want to take aim at the environmental, social and governance investment trend. One high-powered member is the House Financial Services Committee chairman, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, who has publicly opposed a new S.E.C. proposal on environmental disclosure rules. The Freedom Caucus wants to follow the lead of some red states. Texas is among Republican-led states trying to decouple E.S.G. requirements from public pensions, and even demanding divestment from asset managers like BlackRock. Representative Chip Roy of Texas last year sponsored the No ESG at TSP Act, which would affect the pensions of federal employees and the military. (Mr. Roy emerged as a key player in the speakership negotiations, and could become a bigger voice in the E.S.G. debate in Washington.) \u201cThe political environment is chaotic,\u201d said Chong Park, a partner and antitrust specialist at the law firm Ropes & Gray. Corporate clients are likely to keep quiet on climate goals right now \u2014 a trend known as \u201cgreen hushing\u201d \u2014 unless environmentalism is essential to their branding. \u201cPeople are just waiting for the dust to settle. That\u2019s where green hushing is coming in,\u201d Mr. Park told DealBook. \u201cThey\u2019re just exercising caution.\u201d\n\nJack Ma was China\u2019s most famous businessman until Xi Jinping decided he shouldn\u2019t be. Ma will cede control of the fintech company Ant Group, it was disclosed this weekend, and the markets seem to be OK with that. The Hong Kong-listed shares in his Alibaba and other related companies rose sharply as investors bet that this will be the final act of Mr. Ma\u2019s defenestration. Ant\u2019s pulled I.P.O. kicked off a broader regulatory crackdown. The sister company of Alibaba is the dominant financial portal for more than 1 billion users in China and was set to launch a record-breaking $37 billion initial public offering in November 2020. But officials scuppered it at the last minute after Mr. Ma publicly criticized Chinese regulators and state-owned banks. Beijing wants business to know who\u2019s in charge. The move was seen as an attempt by the Communist Party to assert its control over the economy and the country\u2019s tycoons, stoking wider concerns about the role of private enterprise and wiping billions off the share prices of Big Tech. The stock market capitalization of Alibaba has fallen by about two-thirds since its 2020 peak, erasing more than $500 billion in value. Investors hope officials are changing tack. The authorities have eased some restrictions on the sector, including resuming approval for imported video games. The share price of Tencent, China\u2019s biggest internet company, is up more than 10 percent since the start of the year and more than 50 percent over the past three months. The end of zero-Covid may provide a bigger jolt. As the economy has been pummeled by three years of zero-Covid, the real reason officials have shifted could be that they need the sector to start performing again. And the easing of restrictions may offer more hope for private companies and the global economy, especially as the country reopens to the outside world. What\u2019s next for Ant and Mr. Ma? Hong Kong listing rules mean that Ant bosses cannot resume an I.P.O. for at least another 12 months. Meanwhile, Mr. Ma has largely remained out of sight for the past two years. He has reportedly shown up in Japan and Thailand recently, but is going nowhere near the types of high-profile public events at which he used to be a fixture. And ultimately, that is probably the best indicator of who remains in charge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a bet that this book has got legs. It\u2019s not going to be a flash in the pan.\u201d \u2014 James Daunt, who heads Barnes & Noble and the British bookstore chain Waterstones, on the intense public attention around Prince Harry\u2019s upcoming tell-all memoir, \u201cSpare.\u201d Beyond earnings, the U.S. will get some of its last inflation data before the Fed announces a rate decision at the conclusion of next meeting, which is scheduled from Jan. 31 to Feb. 1.

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 As a shocked nation watched live on television and social media, thousands of radical supporters of a defeated president marched on the seat of the federal government, convinced that an election had been stolen. The mob ransacked the Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. It took the authorities several hours to arrest hundreds of people and finally restore order. Hopefully, that was the last act for the bolsonaristas, extremist supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was once called the Trump of the Tropics. Yet, as with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, it is unclear if this is the end of a political movement or just the beginning of more division and chaos. The new president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, already faced a difficult challenge to unite his divided country, even without a bombastic former president just offstage and many of his supporters now prone to violence. Bringing those responsible for the attack to justice is a vital place to start. On Jan. 1, Mr. Lula was sworn in to his third term as president of Brazil in a ceremonial inauguration in the capital \u2014 but Mr. Bolsonaro didn\u2019t attend. He was supposed to pass the presidential sash to Mr. Lula as a sign of a peaceful transition of power. Instead, he opted to spend the last days of his presidency and the first weeks of Mr. Lula\u2019s administration in Orlando, Fla., at a house near Disney World.\n\nYet in the days since his defeat many of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters have camped outside military bases around the country, figuring that the former president would pull together a last-minute plan. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the date, we don\u2019t know what will happen, we don\u2019t know where, we only trust our president,\u201d one of the protesters told me. In the end, nothing happened, so some members of the mob took matters into their own hands. Over the last two years, Mr. Bolsonaro repeatedly made baseless claims that the electoral system could be manipulated. When Mr. Bolsonaro said there were only three alternatives for his future \u2014 prison, death or victory \u2014 he did not mention a fourth option: go eat fried chicken in the United States, which he was photographed doing in December. In the end, the necessary components for a successful insurrection just weren\u2019t there. The defeated president had neither the institutional nor the public support he needed to jolt the military into taking his side. For a start, he lacked allies. As soon as Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s electoral loss was announced, some of his political allies congratulated the new president-elect. Other Latin American presidents did the same. Joe Biden\u2019s congratulations came late on election night and were heralded in the Brazilian media as important endorsements of the fairness of the electoral process. Most important, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat provoked a much softer outcry among his voters than was feared \u2014 although it was still disruptive. Thousands of his supporters blocked roads and set vehicles on fire in an attempt to paralyze the country. Hundreds of others decided to place tents in front of army barracks across the country, pressuring for military intervention in the government. \u201cS.O.S. armed forces,\u201d they screamed, often alternating martial slogans with Hail Marys and the national anthem. A few weeks later, all roads had been cleared. Some camps remained, including one in the Santana neighborhood here in S\u00e3o Paulo. On Christmas, I spent part of my afternoon talking to a dozen Bolsonaro supporters camped there. They still believed that the elections had been rigged. The strongest evidence came in the form of a question: \u201cIf everybody is here, why has the minority won?\u201d\n\nThey insisted to me that Mr. Lula wouldn\u2019t be sworn in on Jan. 1. \u201cWe are certain that he won\u2019t,\u201d said a woman in her 70s. (The people I spoke to declined to give their names out of fear for their safety.) When I asked what might happen instead, the woman hinted at two possible outcomes: Either the military would be called to support a presidential coup just as the bolsonaristas wanted, or the \u201cgood citizens\u201d would take to the streets \u2014 also allegedly under Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s instructions \u2014 to ensure that he stayed in power. Mr. Lula\u2019s administration, a broad coalition of democratic forces, will lead the country to communism, the protesters told me. That\u2019s why they called for military intervention while interpreting possible secret messages that the president has tapped to them in Morse code. (Yes, they\u2019ve spent some time trying to decipher the drumming of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s fingers on a desk during his last livestream.) The truth is that Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s political capital has dwindled. When he left the country, his vice president, Gen. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, told the nation: \u201cThe alternation of power in a democracy is healthy and must be preserved.\u201d He also made a blunt reference to \u201cleaders who were supposed to reassure and unite the nation around a project for the country\u201d but who had instead fomented a climate of chaos and social collapse. Ouch. It appears that even the armed forces just want a calm transition to power so they can remain a privileged class without too many responsibilities. Some of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s former allies in Congress now support Mr. Lula, and the former president\u2019s Digital Popularity Index, which is tracked by a consulting firm, has fallen more than half since its peak. But hard-core bolsonaristas aren\u2019t to go quietly. Only on Monday did they remove their tents from outside military barracks in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other cities. In Bras\u00edlia, the authorities dismantled the camp and detained 1,200 people. The demonstrators have been waiting for more than two months for a miracle to happen. When it didn\u2019t, they tried to take the government by force. In response, Mr. Lula signed an emergency decree allowing the federal government to intervene and restore order to the capital. It will remain in effect until the end of the month. The federal district governor was temporarily removed from his post by a Supreme Court judge. A criminal investigation has been opened to identify the rioters and their financial sponsors. On Monday, a member of Congress asked the government to request Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s extradition. Democracies need the rule of law to flourish. They also need a shared understanding that power must be transferred peacefully. Mr. Lula has his work cut out for him to hold his nation together. A good starting point will be to keep calm after these deplorable events and firmly follow the rites of justice to hold the culprits accountable.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nInspired by digital art generators like DALL-E, biologists are building artificial intelligences that can fight cancer, flu and Covid.\n\nOur bodies naturally produce about 20,000 proteins, which handle everything from digesting food to moving oxygen through the bloodstream. Now, researchers are working to create proteins that are not found in nature, hoping to improve our ability to fight disease and do things that our bodies cannot on their own. David Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, has been working to build artisanal proteins for more than 30 years. By 2017, he and his team had shown this was possible. But they did not anticipate how the rise of new A.I. technologies would suddenly accelerate this work, shrinking the time needed to generate new blueprints from years down to weeks. \u201cWhat we need are new proteins that can solve modern-day problems, like cancer and viral pandemics,\u201d Dr. Baker said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for evolution.\u201d He added, \u201cNow, we can design these proteins much faster, and with much higher success rates, and create much more sophisticated molecules that can help solve these problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most powerful things about this technology is that, like DALL-E, it does what you tell it to do,\u201d said Nate Bennett, one of the researchers working in the University of Washington lab. \u201cFrom a single prompt, it can generate an endless number of designs.\u201d The San Francisco company is one of the world\u2019s most ambitious artificial intelligence labs. Here\u2019s a look at some recent developments.\n\u2022 None ChatGPT: The cutting-edge chatbot is raising fears of students cheating on their homework.

But for some, image generators are worrisome\n\u2022 None GPT-3: With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can write, argue and code . The implications for the future could be profound To generate images, DALL-E relies on what artificial intelligence researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the network of neurons in the brain. This is the same technology that recognizes the commands you bark into your smartphone, enables self-driving cars to identify (and avoid) pedestrians and translates languages on services like Skype. A neural network learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of corgi photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a corgi. With DALL-E, researchers built a neural network that looked for patterns as it analyzed millions of digital images and the text captions that described what each of these images depicted. In this way, it learned to recognize the links between the images and the words. When you describe an image for DALL-E, a neural network generates a set of key features that this image may include. One feature might be the curve of a teddy bear\u2019s ear. Another might be the line at the edge of a skateboard. Then, a second neural network \u2014 called a diffusion model \u2014 generates the pixels needed to realize these features. The diffusion model is trained on a series of images in which noise \u2014 imperfection \u2014 is gradually added to a photograph until it becomes a sea of random pixels. As it analyzes these images, the model learns to run this process in reverse. When you feed it random pixels, it removes the noise, transforming these pixels into a coherent image. At the University of Washington, other academic labs and new start-ups, researchers are using similar techniques in their effort to create new proteins. Proteins begin as strings of chemical compounds, which then twist and fold into three-dimensional shapes that define how they behave. In recent years, artificial intelligence labs like DeepMind, owned by Alphabet, the same parent company as Google, have shown that neural networks can accurately guess the three-dimensional shape of any protein in the body based just on the smaller compounds it contains \u2014 an enormous scientific advance.\n\nNow, researchers like Dr. Baker are taking another step, using these systems to generate blueprints for entirely new proteins that do not exist in nature. The goal is to create proteins that take on very specific shapes; a particular shape can serve a particular task, such as fighting the virus that causes Covid. Much as DALL-E leverages the relationship between captions and photographs, similar systems can leverage the relationship between a description of what the protein can do and the shape it adopts. Researchers can provide a rough outline for the protein they want, then a diffusion model can generate its three-dimensional shape.",

            "content": "The Golden Globe Awards will be handed out on Tuesday. Last year\u2019s ceremony was not televised.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe group that puts on the ceremony has promised reforms since it plunged into scandal two years ago. On Tuesday, it will try to win back viewers.\n\nFollow our live coverage of the Golden Globe Awards 2023. In 2021, actors accepted Golden Globes remotely at a time when organizers were just beginning to grapple with a growing scandal around finances, ethics and diversity in its ranks. Last year, NBC refused to air the show at all, saying that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the troubled organization at the center of the scandal, needed time to make \u201cmeaningful reform.\u201d But on Tuesday, the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards are back on NBC with a show that will attempt to win the trust of viewers and participants. What is not yet clear is how many of those viewers will return, after a precipitous drop in ratings during the pandemic, and whether celebrities and other members of the industry will appear en masse.\n\nThe Globes have long had a reputation for booziness and irreverence. Will the revived ceremony still be seen as a less-staid alternative to the Academy Awards? Or will the Hollywood Foreign Press take the show more seriously? Here\u2019s a brief history of the ceremony\u2019s downfall, how its organizers are trying to rehabilitate it and what to expect from this year\u2019s telecast. What brought down the Golden Globes? Days before the ceremony in 2021, an investigation by The Los Angeles Times took account of financial and ethical lapses at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and revealed that it had no Black members. At the time, there were 87 total members in the group, and a lawsuit filed by a Norwegian reporter, Kjersti Flaa, who had thrice been denied admittance to the group, accused members of accepting \u201cthousands of dollars in emoluments\u201d from members of the industry who were campaigning for recognition at the Globes. (A lawyer for the association said the lawsuit was a \u201ca transparent attempt to shake down the H.F.P.A. based on jealousy,\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported.) One story of wooing voters became emblematic of a reputation for accepting lavish perks. The Netflix comedy series \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d which was the subject of lackluster reviews, received two nominations after dozens of association members flew to Paris to visit the \u201cEmily\u201d set and were put up by the Paramount Network at a five-star hotel.\n\nThere was also scrutiny over how much members were paid for their involvement. According to filings from the tax year ending in June 2019, the nonprofit paid more than $3 million in salaries and other compensation to members and staff. Serving on one committee, for instance, meant $1,000 a month, a 2021 internal association report shows. How did the H.F.P.A. react? At the ceremony in 2021, the hosts, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, made repeated jabs at the press association over its lack of Black members, and midway through the program, leaders of the group took the stage and pledged to increase the diversity of its membership. In the two years since, it has recruited new members, overhauled eligibility rules and enacted a stricter code of conduct. All existing members \u2014 some of whom have had their journalistic credentials questioned over the years \u2014 needed to reapply. The 96-member group now has six Black members \u2014 up from zero in 2021 \u2014 and has added 103 nonmember voters, a dozen or so of whom are Black. Todd Boehly, the interim chief executive, has moved to end the association\u2019s tax-exempt status and turn it into a for-profit company with a philanthropic arm. (He has been awaiting final governmental approval for that plan, after which he is expected to disband the H.F.P.A.) The H.F.P.A.\u2019s practices have been scrutinized for decades, but this time, Hollywood couldn\u2019t turn away. Netflix, Amazon and WarnerMedia said they would not work with the association unless changes we made. There were condemnations by A-list stars and producers. Shonda Rhimes called out the organization for its treatment of her shows; Tom Cruise returned his Globe trophies; Scarlett Johansson suggested the industry step back from the H.F.P.A. until it tackled \u201cfundamental reform.\u201d\n\nAnd more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to \u201ceradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.\u201d Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group\u2019s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year\u2019s list of presenters \u2014 which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino \u2014 many are planning to show up on Tuesday. When and how do I watch? Wait, aren\u2019t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal\u2019s streaming service, Peacock. Who is the host? The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special \u201cRothaniel,\u201d in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022. And he may be familiar to NBC viewers from his 2015-17 sitcom, \u201cThe Carmichael Show,\u201d or from his turn as host of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last year. Who is expected to attend? The show has announced a list of presenters, including Ana de Armas, who is nominated for her performance as Marilyn Monroe in the Netflix biopic \u201cBlonde\u201d; Jamie Lee Curtis, who is up for a supporting actress award for \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d; and Niecy Nash, who is nominated for her role in Netflix\u2019s \u201cMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\u201d",

            "content": "If Harry is bidding to position himself, like his mother before him, as the people\u2019s prince, this is his heraldic banner. That is, after all, the premise of the book \u2014 that is, a portrait created, he said, not as \u201cthe prince I was born but as the man I have become.\u201d\n\nSo there he is: the man he has become. For all to see.\n\nThe photo positions Harry in the most accessible, uncostumed way possible, which is, of course, a kind of costume in itself \u2014 just like us, as opposed to just like his family. It is different from King Charles\u2019s recent biography, \u201cThe King: The Life of Charles III,\u201d which captures the king in a double-breasted suit and striped tie, pocket hankie at the ready, or even the most recent Harry and Meghan book, \u201cFinding Freedom,\u201d which depicted the prince in a dove-gray suit alongside his wife. Rather, on his own book cover, Harry is stripped, if not bare, as close to it as is appropriately possible.\n\nHis face is unadorned, save for his beard, which we now know, thanks to his ITV interview with the British journalist Tom Bradby, was the source of brotherly strife, but which was important because, Harry said, it represented \u201cthe new Harry.\u201d The only decorative element is the leather necklace, which given the revelation that William pushed Harry down during a tiff in Nottingham Cottage and ripped his necklace, suddenly seems like an Easter egg, freighted with symbolism.\n\nHarry is not smiling, not gazing off into the sunset or the future or the heavens, not contemplating his own inner thoughts, like many such photos on other recent best-selling memoirs, be it Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming,\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cA Promised Land\u201d or Edward Enninful\u2019s \u201cA Visible Man\u201d (though, as Matt Dorfman, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, pointed out, the simplicity of the typography reflects a similar straightforward design). Instead, Harry seems to be fully present, with no scrim between himself and the reader. The impression is one of immediacy. Of nothing to hide.\n\nHarry is not, of course, the first memoirist to use this strategy. Piers Morgan derisively compared the \u201cSpare\u201d cover to that of Andre Agassi\u2019s 2009 book, \u201cOpen,\u201d also ghostwritten by J.R. Moehringer, who worked with Harry, and also featuring the subject\u2019s head front and center, full-bleed, on the cover. Mr. Morgan was correct in noting the similarity but wrong in seeing that as a failing. It\u2019s a calculated choice, placing the memoir in the tradition of books noted for their honesty, rather than their airbrushing of history.",

On Sunday, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters broke into government buildings in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, to protest what they falsely believe was a stolen election.\n\nLula, as he is known, was able to spend generously on social programs during his first period in office in part because of high prices for many of the commodities that Brazil exports. Brazil is a major producer of steel as well as agricultural products such as citrus and soybeans. Now commodity prices are faltering because of expectations of a global economic downturn. On top of that, Brazil\u2019s central bank has raised its key lending rate to nearly 14 percent in an effort to extinguish inflation, which is running around 6 percent.\n\nBolsonaro, although far right in his politics, governed as a free-spending populist.

The caftans and dresses he wore on the trail were all part of the message.\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. What should you wear to work if you\u2019re nonbinary? It may not be the most pressing question that gender-nonconforming people face on the job, but with approximately 1.2 million L.G.B.T.Q. Americans identifying as nonbinary, employers and employees alike are exploring what professional attire can look like. \u201cI think people treat me with more dignity when I dress more masculinely, but people are way nicer to me when I dress more femininely,\u201d said El Layla Johnson, 33, a former restaurant server who is now a therapist. For Mx. Johnson, getting dressed for work has been a struggle since adolescence. \u201cI just feel like there\u2019s a manual or rule book that people receive and that my copy got lost in the mail,\u201d said Mx. Johnson, who, like many nonbinary people, uses the pronouns they and them.\n\nMx. Johnson recalled regularly crying while getting dressed for work at an upscale restaurant in Seattle. It wasn\u2019t just that they found the restaurant\u2019s dress code to be ugly (though they did). Mx. Johnson had a hard time finding clothes that fit at all. \u201cI\u2019m six feet tall, I\u2019ve always had really big feet and wide shoulders but a small waist and a really big butt,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd so it is not easy for me to find clothing in the men\u2019s section or the women\u2019s section that fits me well.\u201d Now, as a therapist who works with L.G.B.T.Q. patients, Mx. Johnson finds that their own agender identity can be an asset. \u201cThe fact that I have a rat tail and piercings and tattoos, I actually believe that people might feel more comfortable with me or relate to me more easily,\u201d they said. Deciding what\u2019s appropriate for work can be fraught for employees of any gender, especially in this post-lockdown-but-still-Zooming \u201cpower casual\u201d moment. But many nonbinary people report unique pressures that accompany choosing a work outfit. For video call sessions, Mx. Johnson usually opts for simplicity. \u201cI pick one shirt and I wear it all week and I hang it on the back of my office chair,\u201d they said. \u201cAnd that is great because it just takes so much of the consideration out of it.\u201d\n\nOther nonbinary people consider their work outfits an opportunity for self-expression. Ginger Copes, 32, works as a digital producer for CBS in Philadelphia. During an onboarding meeting, employees were encouraged to bring their whole selves to work.

Mx. Copes took the guidance to heart, ditching traditionally masculine looks in favor of maxi skirts paired with button-down shirts. To Mx. Copes\u2019s surprise and delight, the response was positive. Several co-workers remarked that Mx. Copes seemed particularly confident and happy at work, Mx. Copes recalled. \u201cFeeling liberated in the way that you present is just so important because it will also reflect how your mood is, whether you\u2019re dragging yourself to work or you\u2019re showing up as 100 percent yourself and you love it,\u201d Mx. Copes said. This feeling of liberation does not extend to all aspects of Mx. Copes\u2019s life. Fearing violence in their own neighborhood, Mx. Copes changes clothes during their commute home. \u201cI have denim jeans underneath the maxi skirt,\u201d they said. \u201cI just pull down the maxi skirt, and boom: I\u2019m masculine again.\u201d\n\nAndy Izenson, 34, the senior legal director of the Chosen Family Law Center in New York City, primarily considers the needs of clients when dressing for work. \u201cMy strategy in court is to be as invisible as possible,\u201d they said. For Mx. Izenson, \u201cinvisible\u201d usually means a tailored gray men\u2019s suit bought at a thrift store, a steamed white dress shirt and the occasional \u201cfun\u201d floral tie. Mx. Izenson settled on this approach after running a sort of gender-based cost-benefit analysis. \u201cI overshoot in a masculine direction under those circumstances because No. 1, that\u2019s strategic for my client, and No. 2, I can\u2019t predict whether someone\u2019s going to look at me and think that I\u2019m a man or a woman,\u201d Mx. Izenson said. \u201cIf they think that I am a woman in a suit, that\u2019s fine, right?\u201d they added. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird. That doesn\u2019t make anyone want to punch you.\u201d Richard Thompson Ford, a Stanford Law School professor and the author of \u201cDress Codes: How the Laws of Fashion Made History,\u201d has studied rules and laws related to dress since the Middle Ages. \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been a really strong norm, both in terms of law and custom, of enforcing a strict division between masculine and feminine attire,\u201d Professor Ford said.\n\n\u201cOne of the tricky things is that the norms of gendered dress keep shifting,\u201d he said. \u201cDetermining what\u2019s appropriate is always kind of a moving target.\u201d As an example, he cited rules prohibiting women from wearing flapper-style short dresses to work during the 1920s. \u201cAt the time, people said, \u2018It\u2019s not feminine, it\u2019s masculine, but also it\u2019s way too sexy,\u2019\u201d Professor Ford added. \u201cBut today we\u2019d see that as recognizably feminine.\u201d In the United States, it is legal for employers to enforce rules related to attire, hygiene and grooming. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has consistently been interpreted to permit different dress codes for men and women, and in 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled that transgender employees were subject to the dress codes of their gender identity, regardless of their sex assigned at birth. While federal law prohibits employment discrimination against nonbinary people, separate dress codes for men and women can leave nonbinary workers in a puzzling place.\n\n\u201cGovernment, including the Democratic Party, needs to embrace and welcome that it is normal that people wear whatever makes them feel powerful and confident and secure,\u201d said Mx. Olivares, who lost his district\u2019s Democratic primary to the incumbent, Erik M. Dilan, in June. During his campaign, Mx. Olivares championed the inclusion of nonbinary candidates in state and local politics, a cause that was bolstered last summer when Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York signed the Gender Inclusive Ballot Act into law, requiring political parties to include an option besides \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d for those seeking party offices. At his job in public relations for the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization Lambda Legal, Mx. Olivares has encountered little resistance and much praise for his style of dress. \u201cPeople are embracing it and I don\u2019t think it has been much of an issue,\u201d he said. Cooper Howell, a 34-year-old actor, moonlights as a bartender at the Manhattan gay bar Hush. Instead of jeans, they sometimes opt for a kilt as a reminder to be true to themself. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily care what you wear as long as you\u2019re shirtless and hot and can talk to the endless throng of white gay boys named Kyle,\u201d Mx. Howell said of the bar\u2019s management. Working in such an environment, Mx. Howell will sometimes catch themself slipping back into a butch persona. \u201cI will retreat back into my old habits of trying to conform to male normative behavior,\u201d Mx. Howell said. Their voice deepens and wrist movements are restricted. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really uncomfortable place to retreat back to.\u201d\n\nAnd some nonbinary people are eager to focus less on their outfits and more on their work. \u201cI used to be that typical bureaucrat: I thought whatever you wore mattered more than what you have to say,\u201d said Ace Sutherland, 28. Mx. Sutherland recalls being called out by co-workers in previous jobs for avoiding blazers. Today, Mx. Sutherland is a representative for Equality New York, an L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group that welcomes their sweaters and polo shirts. \u201cI want to make sure that people that look up to me, people that I work with, know that I can dress however I want to dress and still have the same conversation that would be necessary at that time,\u201d they said.",

Another severe storm is expected on Monday.Credit...Mike Kai Chen for The New York Times\n\nHundreds of homes in the Santa Cruz region were damaged by flooding and wind. Weary residents are steeling themselves for even worse conditions this week.\n\nExtreme rain, wind and powerful waves hit the coast around Santa Cruz, Calif., last week. Another severe storm is expected on Monday.\n\nAPTOS, Calif. \u2014 Chuck Hawley stared out at the waves swirling through Monterey Bay as he prepared to destroy the small beachfront home his parents built by hand in 1957. He had no choice: Storm-fueled waves in the region, just east of Santa Cruz, had torn the 1,100-square-foot house off its foundations and floated it 30 feet into the street. There it sat, miraculously still intact but posing a hazard by blocking the road to cars. Mr. Hawley\u2019s parents started bringing him and his siblings to the beach house when he was 2, and Mr. Hawley, now the property manager, often rented it to family friends. He recalled sitting on the deck and watching the surf for hours with his father, who has since died. Mr. Hawley, 67, had hoped that one day his grandchildren would form similar memories there. Instead, he was left with a sense of emptiness. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two days to come to the conclusion that this house that\u2019s been around for 65 years is no more,\u201d he said, choking up.\n\nAn unlucky confluence of high tides, storm surge and high surf left hundreds of homes and dozens of businesses damaged by floodwater and mountains of sand this past weekend. The extreme conditions eroded coastlines and beaches, destroyed parts of several piers and forced many to evacuate low-lying homes. A string of major storms in California has caused extreme flooding and damage across the state.\n\u2022 None Flood Risk: Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding could disproportionately affect Black residents\n\u2022 None Homeless Populations: Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms in a way few others did\n\u2022 None Drought: All the rain and snow All the rain and snow are undoubtedly good news for California\u2019s water supply , but they\u2019re unlikely to end the drought altogether\n\u2022 None Resilient Forests: Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees are adapted to a wide range of weather events \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned,\u201d said Dave Reid, the director of the Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery & Resilience. \u201cAs you get more and more of these rain events piling on top of each other, our mountains literally begin to melt, and we get more landslides and damage to our infrastructure.\u201d Mr. Reid said the unrelenting nature of the storms, just days apart from one another, was exhausting emergency responders and impeding the county\u2019s efforts to assess damage and begin repairs. \u201cWe really consider this disaster to be the cumulative effect of all of these events in such a short time frame,\u201d he said. Santa Cruz has long been far rainier than its neighboring counties, mostly because of its topography, said Jan Null, a veteran meteorologist and former lead forecaster for the National Weather Service. Storms coming from the Pacific Ocean slam into the Santa Cruz Mountains, forcing the air to lift and become colder, which creates more precipitation. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon in any given storm to have four times the rainfall in the Santa Cruz Mountains as you do in San Francisco,\u201d Mr. Null said.\n\nThe ferocity of the waves and severity of structural damage recalled, for some residents, memories of the disastrous 1982 storm that flooded rivers, badly damaged a bridge and killed 22 people, including 10 in a landslide that occurred just as a 30-hour rainstorm let up. In January of that year, the hillside above Love Creek, about 10 miles north of Santa Cruz, turned to liquid, with approximately 600,000 cubic yards of land \u2014 enough to fill 60,000 dump trucks \u2014 sliding down the mountain. This year\u2019s storm rivals 1982\u2019s, \u201cand nothing else in between has come close,\u201d said Carin Hanna, 78, who owns the Craft Gallery gift shop in Capitola, a town next to Santa Cruz. \u201cIt shows the incredible force of the ocean,\u201d she added. Santa Cruz is also prone to flooding because its creeks and its biggest waterway, the San Lorenzo River, are not big enough to contain all of the water from heavy rainfall, experts say. Over the weekend, the river was so swollen that surfers were riding waves headed out to sea, rather than the other direction, and emergency responders warned of flood risks along the banks on Monday. Parts of West Cliff Drive, a winding Santa Cruz road at the edge of the cliffs overlooking the ocean, were closed after chunks of the street were wiped out by 20-foot-tall waves. Earlier storms had already pounded at the cliffs and washed away some barriers, like riprap \u2014 giant rocks placed at the edge of the cliffs to protect against erosion \u2014 a frightening sight for some residents.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Lindsay Maggioncalda was on her laptop in a meeting for her job at Duolingo, the language platform, on the second floor of her oceanfront home in Santa Cruz. Suddenly, a wave struck the storm-resistant window mere feet away from where she was sitting on the couch. \u201cTons of water just went bam, like a huge crash, big vibrations,\u201d Ms. Maggioncalda, 25, said. \u201cI was gasping.\u201d Her father, Jeff Maggioncalda, ventured into the soaked neighborhood to film the chaos, retreating quickly when more waves blasted through the gaps in the street near him. \u201cThis was by far the worst storm we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Mr. Maggioncalda, 54, the chief executive of the online education company Coursera. During a dry period on Saturday, residents were doing their best to clear logs from their yards, replace soggy sandbags and shovel away the sand that had burst through their garage doors. Walking on Rio Del Mar Beach in Aptos with her two dogs, Isaura Rochin, 52, was picking up trash that had swept onto the beach. In the distance, the S.S. Palo Alto, a World War I-era concrete tanker ship beloved by local residents, who know it as the Cement Ship, had been badly damaged by the storm, and part of the pier connecting it to Seacliff State Beach had crumbled into the sea. \u201cI\u2019m sad about the wharf,\u201d Ms. Rochin said. \u201cThe Cement Ship, I\u2019m sad, but it\u2019s been deteriorating for years and years.\u201d\n\nIn Capitola, as rain began to drench the streets once again, Dominick King was rushing to save anything he could from his restaurant, My Thai Beach, before the next storm. The restaurant, along with many others next to the beach, was soaked by floodwater that crept up from the foundation, severing plumbing and warping the floor. Mr. King, 34, had just remodeled the interior after inheriting the restaurant from his mother, who had struggled to steer it through the coronavirus pandemic. Now, he expects it to be closed for months. \u201cWe were trying to get the business back on the right foot,\u201d he said. \u201cThings were going really good. It\u2019s tough, man. It\u2019s definitely a huge setback.\u201d Gary Griggs, a professor of earth sciences who has taught at the University of California, Santa Cruz, since the 1960s, said that the same spots in Santa Cruz, like the Capitola pier and West Cliff Drive, had been damaged once or twice a decade by storms, but that people had \u201cshort-disaster memory.\u201d He said the region needed to seriously consider moving development away from the coastline because there was no way to escape inevitable sea level rise.",

Bella Ramsey, left, and Anna Torv in \u201cThe Last of Us.\u201d\n\nBetween network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Jan. 9-15. Details and times are subject to change. A QUIET PLACE (2018) and US (2019) 5 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. on FXM. Why do families make for such rich horror fodder? Because they have complex internal dynamics? Or because family vacations can be naturally hellish? Whatever the reasons, these two modern horror blockbusters make for a nice do-it-yourself double feature. First, at 5 p.m., \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d from John Krasinski, which centers on a mother (Emily Blunt) and father (Krasinski) raising their children (Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe) in a post-apocalyptic world where sightless aliens hunt for humans by ear. Then, at 6:50 p.m., is Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cUs,\u201d about a mother and father (Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Winston Duke) and their two children (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex) who are stalked by their psychotic doppelg\u00e4ngers while on a seaside vacation. A statue on display at the announcement of Golden Globe nominations in December. 80TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS 8 p.m. on NBC. The Golden Globes return Tuesday night after an ethics, finance and diversity scandal involving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the awards, led to the cancellation of the 2022 telecast \u2014 and an ongoing debate about whether the Globes should exist at all. It\u2019s unclear whether Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, hosted by the comic and filmmaker Jerrod Carmichael, will be anything like the movie-awards-season bellwether the Globes have traditionally been. But the top categories include many films and shows of note: Nominees in the best picture, drama, category are \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d \u201cElvis,\u201d \u201cThe Fabelmans,\u201d \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d and \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Best picture, musical or comedy, nominees are \u201cBabylon,\u201d \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\u201d and \u201cTriangle of Sadness.\u201d And TV shows up for multiple awards include \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d THE MENU (2022) 9 p.m. on HBO Signature. Snootiness smells like caviar in this dark satire of fancy dining from the director Mark Mylod ( \u201cSuccession\u201d). The story centers on a young couple, Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Tyler (Nicholas Hoult), dining at a luxe island restaurant run by a famous chef (Ralph Fiennes). As courses are served, the night grows ever more chaotic \u2014 and, eventually, violent. The movie is far from subtle, taking on its satire \u201cmore often with cleaver than paring knife,\u201d Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times. \u201cYet everyone is having such a good time, it\u2019s impossible not to join them,\u201d she added. \u201cThe movie\u2019s eye might be on haute cuisine, but its heart is pure fish and chips.\u201d WILLIE NELSON: LIVE AT BUDOKAN 8:30 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This 1984 concert from Willie Nelson was filmed in Japan, but, watching it, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking otherwise: The stage is backed by an enormous Texas flag. See Nelson perform some of his biggest songs, including \u201cWhiskey River\u201d and \u201cOn the Road Again,\u201d during an era that was arguably his peak. DAYS OF THUNDER (1990) 8 p.m. on AMC. Four years after \u201cTop Gun,\u201d the director Tony Scott released another Tom-Cruise-in-a-dangerous-vehicle movie with this drama about the escapades of a NASCAR newcomer (Cruise). You won\u2019t hear Kenny Loggins sing \u201cDanger Zone\u201d here, for better or worse, though you will experience a relatively early score from Hans Zimmer. WHITE HEAT (1949) 4:15 p.m. on TCM. James Cagney, Virginia Mayo and Edmond O\u2019Brien star in this classic film noir about a gangster (Cagney) who unknowingly brings an F.B.I. agent into his crew. When the movie debuted in 1949, the critic Bosley Crowther pointed to its \u201cthermal intensity\u201d in his review for The Times. \u201cThere is no blinking the obvious,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe Warners have pulled all the stops in making this picture the acme of the gangster-prison film.\u201d YOUR HONOR 9 p.m. on Showtime. Bryan Cranston returns as a former New Orleans judge on a downward spiral in the second season of this drama, adapted from the Israeli TV series \u201cKvodo.\u201d Its grim story follows Cranston\u2019s character, Michael Desiato, in the aftermath of his son\u2019s involvement in a hit-and-run collision that killed the son of a prominent crime-family kingpin. The new season picks up where the first left off, in the wake of a grisly accident. THE LAST OF US 9 p.m. on HBO. \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d a post-apocalyptic PlayStation series, became one of the most highly regarded video games of the past decade through cinematic gameplay and strong writing. Whether that makes adapting it for TV easier (the games have a first-rate story) or harder (they already play like movies, why bother?) is an open question. Sunday\u2019s debut episode introduces the flesh-and-blood versions of Joel (Pedro Pascal), a seasoned survivor, and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a teenager whom Joel is hired to smuggle out of a dangerous quarantine zone. The show is a creation of Neil Druckmann, who was behind the original game series, and the screenwriter Craig Mazin, who created the 2019 HBO mini-series \u201cChernobyl.\u201d",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nSpeaker, Speaker, What Do You See? I See MAGA Looking at Me.\n\nBret Stephens: Gail, remember \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin,\u201d the unforgettable Lionel Shriver novel about a woman whose son murders his classmates? Maybe someone should write the sequel: \u201cWe Need to Talk About What They Did to Kevin.\u201d Gail Collins: A book-length disquisition on Kevin McCarthy, Bret? I dunno. Always thought his strongest suit was that he was too boring to hate. But now that he\u2019s apparently promised the Republican right wing everything but permission to bring pet ocelots to the House floor, I can see it. Bret: Too boring to hate or too pathetic to despise? I\u2019ve begun to think of McCarthy almost as a literary archetype, like one of those figures in a Joseph Conrad novel whose follies make them weak and whose weakness leads them to folly. Gail: Love your literary allusions. But let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re in charge of the Republican Party \u2014 tell me what you think of him in general.\n\nBret: A few honorable exceptions aside, the G.O.P. is basically split between reptiles and invertebrates. McCarthy is the ultimate invertebrate. He went to Mar-a-Lago just a short while after Jan. 6 to kiss the ring of the guy who incited the mob that, by McCarthy\u2019s own admission, wanted to kill him. He hated Liz Cheney because of her backbone. But he quailed before Marjorie Taylor Greene because she has a forked tongue. He gave away the powers and prerogatives of the office of speaker in order to gain the office, which is like a slug abandoning its shell and thinking it won\u2019t be stepped on. A better man would have told the Freedom Caucus holdouts to shove it. Instead, as a friend of mine put it, McCarthy decided to become the squeaker of the House. Bret: If there\u2019s a silver lining here, it\u2019s that the whole spectacle has shown voters what they get for voting for this Republican Party. Gail: Hey, you\u2019re still in charge of Republicans. Now that they\u2019re sort of in command, do you have hopes they\u2019ll make progress on your priorities, like controlling government spending? Without, um, failing to make the nation\u2019s debt payments \u2026. Bret: Buried in the noise about McCarthy\u2019s humiliation is that his opponents had some reasonable demands. One of them was to give members of Congress a minimum of 72 hours to read the legislation they were voting on. Another was to limit bills to a single subject. The idea is to do away with the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink spending packages that Congress has lately become way too fond of. Gail: Yeah, I can buy into that one. Bret: On the other hand, the idea that this Republican clown show is going to accomplish anything significant \u2014 particularly since doing so would require them to work with a Democratic president and Senate \u2014 is roughly the equivalent of Vladimir Putin leaving the vocation of vile despot to become a \u2026 cannabis entrepreneur. Not going to happen.\n\nGail: Well, one plus is that we don\u2019t have to worry about the Republican House passing some terrible, nutty legislation since the Senate is there to put a halt to it. Interesting how much better obstruction looks when your party is doing the obstructing \u2026. Bret: It\u2019s almost \u2014 almost \u2014 enough to be grateful to people like Herschel Walker and Blake Masters for being such deliriously awful candidates. Gail: When it comes to positive action, like keeping the government running, I\u2019d like to think the moderate Dems and the moderate Republicans could get together and come to some agreement on the basics. Do you think there\u2019s a chance? Bret: What was the name of that Bret Easton Ellis novel? \u201cLess Than Zero.\u201d Bipartisanship became a four-letter word for most Republicans sometime around 2012. If we can avoid another useless government shutdown, I\u2019ll consider it a minor miracle. On the other hand, all this is good for Democrats. In our last conversation, I predicted that McCarthy wouldn\u2019t win the speakership and that Joe Biden would decide against a second term. I was wrong on the first. Now I\u2019m beginning to think I was also wrong on the second, in part because Republicans are in such manifest disarray. What is your spidey sense telling you? Gail: Yeah, Biden knows 80 is old for another run, but the chance to take on Donald Trump again is probably going to be irresistible. Bret: Assuming it\u2019s going to be Trump, which, increasingly, I doubt. Gail: You really think it\u2019s going to be Ron DeSantis? My theory is that if the field opens up at all, there\u2019ll be a swarm of Republican hopefuls, dividing the Trump opposition.\n\nBret: It\u2019ll be DeSantis or you can serve me a platter of crow. Never mind that Trump still managed to seal the deal for McCarthy\u2019s speakership by winning over a few of the last holdouts. It still took him 15 ballots. Gail: But about Biden \u2014 if he did drop out, Democrats would have to figure out what to do about Kamala Harris. A woman, a minority, with the classic presidential training job. Yet a lot of people haven\u2019t found her all that impressive as a potential leader. My vote would be for him to announce he\u2019s not running instantly, and let all the other potential heirs go for it. Bret: How do you solve a problem like Kamala? My initial hope was that she\u2019d grow into the job. That hasn\u2019t seemed to have happened. My second hope was that Biden would give her a task in which she\u2019d shine. Didn\u2019t happen either. My third hope was that Biden would ask her to fill Stephen Breyer\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court and then nominate Gina Raimondo or Pete Buttigieg to the vice presidency, setting either of them up to be the front-runner in \u201924 or \u201928. Whoops again. Now Dems are saddled with their own version of Dan Quayle, minus the gravitas. Gail: Not fair to compare her to Dan Quayle. But otherwise OK with your plan. Go on. Bret: I also think Biden should announce he isn\u2019t going to run, both on account of his age and the prospect of running against someone like DeSantis. But the argument is harder to make given the midterm results, Republican chaos, the sense that he\u2019s defied the skeptics to pass a lot of legislation and the increasingly likely prospect that Ukraine will prevail over Russia this year and give him a truly historic geopolitical win. I just hope that if he does run, he switches veeps. It would \u2026 reassure the nation. Gail: So happy to hear you\u2019re on a Biden fan track. Does that apply to his new plan for the Mexican border, too? Bret: Not a Biden fan, exactly, though I do root for a successful presidency on general principle. As for the border plan, the good news is that he finally seems to be recognizing the scale of the problem and promising tougher enforcement. It\u2019s also good that he\u2019s doing more for political refugees from oppressive countries like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nBret: The right step now is to start pushing for realistic bipartisan immigration reform that gives Republicans more money for border wall construction and security in exchange for automatic citizenship for Dreamers, an expanded and renewable guest-worker visa that helps bring undocumented workers out of the shadows and a big increase in the \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d EB-1 visas for our future Andy Groves and Albert Einsteins. What do you think? Gail: I was waiting for you to get to the border wall itself, which we disagree about. Terrible symbol, awful to try to maintain and not always effective. Bret: All true, except that it paves the way for a good legislative compromise and can save lives if it deters dangerous border crossings. Gail: Moneywise, the border states deserve increased federal aid to handle their challenges. A good chunk should go to early childhood education, which would not only help the new arrivals but also local children born into non-English-speaking families. The aid should also go to states like New York that are getting busloads of new immigrants \u2014 some from those Arizona and Texas busing plots, but a good number just because they\u2019re the newcomers\u2019 choice destination. I believe there was a bipartisan plan hatched in the House that included citizenship for Dreamers \u2014 an obvious reform that, amazingly, we haven\u2019t yet achieved. But bipartisan plans aren\u2019t doing real well right now. Bret: It\u2019s still worth a shot. I\u2019m sorry Biden didn\u2019t invest the kind of political capital into immigration reform that he did into the infrastructure and climate change bills. And if Republicans wind up voting down funding for a border wall out of spite for Dreamers, I can\u2019t see how that helps Republicans or hurts Democrats. Supporting them seems like smart politics at the very minimum.\n\nBefore we go, Gail, one more point of note: We just passed the second anniversary of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. I was happy to see Biden honor the heroes of that day at a White House ceremony. Also happy to see the Justice Department continue to prosecute hundreds of cases. And appalled to watch Brazil\u2019s right-wing loons try to imitate the Jan. 6 insurrectionists by storming their own parliament. Any suggestions for going forward? Gail: Well, what we really need to see is an effort by Republicans, some of whom were endangered themselves during the attack, but virtually none of whom have shown any interest in revisiting that awful moment \u2014 only one member of the party showed up for that ceremony. Now that Kevin McCarthy has his job in hand, let\u2019s see him call for a bipartisan committee to come up with some suggestions. Ha ha ha. Sorry \u2014 don\u2019t want to end on a snippy note. Bret: Not snippy at all. Truthful. We could start by requiring a civics course for all incoming members of Congress. Maybe some of them might learn that their first duty is to the Constitution, not to themselves.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe measure, one of the new majority\u2019s first legislative moves, would cut billions in funding that Democrats passed to help crack down on tax cheats. It does not have enough votes to pass the Senate.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans, in one of their first legislative moves, voted to cut funding for the Internal Revenue Service on Monday, as conservative lawmakers try to kneecap President Biden\u2019s $80 billion overhaul of the beleaguered agency. The measure does not have the votes to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, let alone receive approval from Mr. Biden. It passed the House, 221 to 210 along party lines, with every Democrat in opposition and Republicans applauding upon passage. But the legislation serves as an opening salvo from the new Republican majority, which is seeking to undercut the policy accomplishments of Democrats over the past two years, when they controlled both Congress and the White House. The Biden administration issued a statement of policy on Monday confirming that the president would veto the measure and dismissing it as \u201ca reckless bill.\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said that \u201cthis is a giveaway to the multimillionaires and big corporations, and Democrats won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that the Republican bill to rescind billions of dollars in I.R.S. funding would actually increase the deficit by $114 billion through 2032. \u201cThey don\u2019t want a fairer tax administration \u2014 they think it\u2019s bad for some of their supporters,\u201d Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said in debate with Republicans on the House floor. \u201cWhat they\u2019re attempting to do tonight is bad for middle-class families. It\u2019s bad for small businesses.\u201d Representative Michelle Steel, Republican of California, acknowledged that \u201cthe agency needs reform and modernization,\u201d but argued that the money did not prioritize those goals. Representative Adrian Smith of Nebraska, the Republican who led debate over the legislation, said the measure \u201cstops autopilot funding for an out-of-control government agency that is perhaps most in need of reform.\u201d J.P. Freire, a spokesman for Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee, said on Twitter that the revenue estimates would necessitate more audits on middle-class taxpayers. He argued that the agency often audited taxpayers who did not owe the government any additional money. \u201cAnd ramping up those audits is going to be painful,\u201d Mr. Freire said. The money is intended to invest in an agency that has become depleted over the years. The effects of years of neglect and Republican cuts on the I.R.S. budget were highlighted by reports recently published by the Ways and Means Committee as it released former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s taxes. The Biden administration has promised to prioritize using the additional funding to improve customer service at the I.R.S. so that it is easier for taxpayers to get answers to questions. It has also pledged that audit rates for taxpayers earning less than $400,000 a year will not go up.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe black bear was found nesting on a bed of leaves in a crawl space of their house in Plainville, Conn., last month. A TikTok video of the bear has been viewed more than 15 million times.\n\nOn Dec. 30, Vinny Dashukewich and his girlfriend, Olivia Unwin, were playing with his 3-year-old pit bull, Cali, in his backyard in Plainville, Conn., when the dog began acting strangely, growling insistently near a raised outdoor deck. Cali\u2019s behavior was atypical, Mr. Dashukewich said, as she usually has a sweet disposition. Then, Ms. Unwin yelled that she\u2019d spotted a bear. Mr. Dashukewich didn\u2019t believe it at first. He scanned the woods behind the house, which he shares with his parents and his sister Tyler, but spotted no such animal. Then he locked eyes with a large black bear underneath the house\u2019s elevated deck. The bear, fat and groggy, was nestled in a crawl space, stretched out on a bed of leaves and a tarp.\n\n\u201cHe was totally unfazed by everything,\u201d Mr. Dashukewich said. \u201cAs soon as we saw each other he didn\u2019t move, he didn\u2019t react. He\u2019s definitely super comfortable.\u201d A video of the bear that Tyler Dashukewich posted on TikTok has been viewed more than 15 million times. The family has since named the bear Marty Bearnard and given him his own Instagram account with a bio that reads: \u201cCurrently I am hibernating until i\u2019m ready for hot bear summer.\u201d The Dashukewich siblings said that they had spotted many bears near the property over the years but that this was the closest they had ever come to one. For now, coexistence has been serene, they said. Shortly after meeting their new outdoor houseguest, Ms. Dashukewich said the family contacted the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environment Protection. Upon reviewing pictures of the animal, the agency said it appeared to be a male black bear. Ms. Dashukewich said the agency told them they could either harass the bear with noise or stimulation to get him to flee, or let him rest until he is done hibernating, likely in several months.\n\nBlack bears, the most diminutive type of bear in North America, are omnivores that prefer wooded habitats, according to the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environment Protection. Adult males can weigh over 500 pounds, it said. Over the last two decades, there has been a \u201crapid increase\u201d in Connecticut\u2019s black bear population, according to the department, which estimates that there are more than 1,000 of them in the state. Jason Hawley, a wildlife biologist with the department, said in an email that reports of bears seeking shelter under decks and porches are not uncommon. \u201cWe get 10-20 reports of bears denning under porches every year, and we have never had a negative incident that occurred as a result of this,\u201d Mr. Hawley said. The agency, he added, encourages homeowners to let the bears stay there before they move on, usually around April. He emphasized, however, that the department advises people against advertising \u201cthe fact that the bear is there to avoid attracting attention.\u201d During hibernation, black bears lower their body temperature and heart rate but can still be responsive and move swiftly if disturbed, Emily Carrollo, a wildlife biologist at the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWith easy-to-follow recipes developed in her native Canada, she became one of the world\u2019s top cookbook authors, publishing more than 30 million copies.\n\nJean Par\u00e9, a cookbook author who taught millions of Canadians how to cook with her series of more than 200 self-published cookbooks called \u201cCompany\u2019s Coming,\u201d died on Dec. 24 in Edmonton, Alberta. She was 95. Her death, in a hospital, was confirmed by her granddaughter Amanda Lovig Hagg. She did not specify a cause but said that Ms. Par\u00e9\u2019s health had been deteriorating for about a year. Ms. Par\u00e9 wrote her first cookbook in 1981, when she was 54. The book, \u201c150 Delicious Squares,\u201d a collection of some of her most popular dessert recipes from her nearly two-decade career as a caterer in Vermilion, Alberta, was a smash, selling about 1.5 million copies. By the time she retired in 2011, more than 30 million copies of her cookbooks had been sold, including more than a million in the United States, making her one of the world\u2019s top-selling cookbook authors. But even as her publishing empire expanded and the books became ubiquitous in kitchens, they retained the homey quality of recipes for everyday cooking from a regular Canadian mom.\n\nThe recipes were easy to follow and used common, affordable ingredients. Ms. Par\u00e9 insisted that her books have a flat binding so readers could easily lay them on their counters, and she wanted realistic pictures of the recipes. \u201cHer golden rule of cooking is to never share a recipe you wouldn\u2019t use yourself,\u201d Ms. Lovig Hagg said. Ms. Par\u00e9 (pronounced \u201cPerry\u201d) began catering in 1963 after a divorce left her as a single mother with children to support. She became known for her \u201cmidnight lunches\u201d at parties she catered, trays of dessert squares brought out near the end of the celebrations. Dozens of partygoers would ask for her recipes, she told The New York Times in a 2019 interview. Several times a night, she said, she would hand-write the recipes for desserts like brownies, matrimonial date squares and Nanaimo bars, a three-layer Canadian specialty. Ms. Par\u00e9\u2019s first cookbook, \u201c150 Delicious Squares,\u201d has sold more than 14 million copies. \u201cPeople used to ask for recipes so much, and I\u2019d always give it to them, and finally they started asking, \u2018Why don\u2019t you put these out in books so we don\u2019t have to ask you all the time?\u2019\u201d Ms. Par\u00e9 said. \u201cSo that seemed to be the thing to do.\u201d\n\nHer son Grant Lovig encouraged her to pursue the idea and offered to help her \u201cthrow a business together,\u201d he said in an interview. On the weekend after their conversation, he drove the three hours from his home in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to his mother\u2019s house in Vermilion. By the time he arrived, he said, she already had 50 recipes ready. \u201cMy grandma could write a recipe when she\u2019s wasn\u2019t in the kitchen,\u201d Ms. Lovig Hagg said. \u201cShe could envision it so realistically. She can be on an airplane or in a movie and jot down a recipe. She was able to create and dream up meals like that. It\u2019s a bit like magic.\u201d Ms. Par\u00e9 was born Jean Shirley Elford on Dec. 7, 1927. Her parents, Edward and Ruby (Locke) Elford, owned a general store in Irma, Alberta, a small farming community about 335 miles north of the U.S. border. Her passion for cooking came from her mother, her family said. Ms. Elford encouraged her in the kitchen, and during the Great Depression she always had something ready in the kitchen for anyone in need. That kindness inspired the title for Ms. Par\u00e9\u2019s series, \u201cCompany\u2019s Coming,\u201d a phrase her mother used in the 1930s when hungry homeless men arriving by the Canadian Railway looking for work approached their home. Her mother always fed them. After Ms. Par\u00e9 divorced her first husband, Clarence Lovig, she opened a cafe, where she met Larry Par\u00e9, an electrician who was a customer there and who loved her apple pies with a slice of Velveeta cheese. He became her second husband. In addition to her son Grant and granddaughter Amanda, Ms. Par\u00e9 is survived by three other children whom she had with Mr. Lovig \u2014 Lyall and Brian Lovig and Gail Lovig-Eskelson; three stepchildren, Robert Par\u00e9, Maxine Sweeney and Larry Par\u00e9; and 49 other grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren.\n\nMs. Par\u00e9\u2019s first catering job was in 1963, when she agreed to make dinner for more than 1,000 people celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Vermilion School of Agriculture, now called Lakeland College. As the catering business grew, she sold the cafe. Book publishers weren\u2019t interested in her first cookbook because it was exclusively desserts at a time when \u201cpeople don\u2019t eat sugar anymore,\u201d they told Grant Lovig. So he and his mother created their own company, Company\u2019s Coming Publishing Ltd. Neither of them had any publishing experience. \u201cIt was a really big risk,\u201d Mr. Lovig said. \u201cBut ignorance is bliss and we were enthusiastic, and we believed in it.\u201d Ms. Par\u00e9 had a knack for creating recipes and improving existing ones, and she read cookbooks from cover to cover. By the time she started compiling her recipes for a book, including those she\u2019d collected from her mother and grandmother, she had amassed thousands. The cookbook would have been \u201cthree feet between the covers,\u201d Mr. Lovig said. They decided to publish several books themselves, organized by topic. The first one, the one that publishers had rejected as too sugary, has sold more than 14 million copies.",

The answer is subjective, but to me it comes down to two: New York and London. Neither is associated historically with a winemaking region, which is part of what makes them so great. Without the legacy of local production, both cities were compelled to look far and wide for wine, and as port cities, they had access to wines from wherever they were made. In London, the far older city, that freedom required far-reaching discernment. Wine lovers needed to judge every sort of wine on its merits rather than specialize in what was easily accessible. Americans have Britain to thank, or to blame, for the notion of wine connoisseurship. Expertise with an open heart is an extraordinary thing. Combined with insularity and disdain, however, it gives rise to snobbery and pretentiousness, which is the bane of wine everywhere.\n\nI have always believed that New York was the best city for wine, but after 10 days in London in late November, I am rethinking that conviction. Great wine lists can be found, of course, at the most expensive restaurants with multiple Michelin stars, as well as at famous places like St. John and the Ledbury. But I skipped those and a few other restaurants with excellent reputations for wine, like Gymkhana, an Indian restaurant in Mayfair, Sager & Wilde in Bethnal Green, the 10 Cases in Covent Garden and Planque in Haggerston. London\u2019s place as a noteworthy wine city is felt in all sorts of restaurants, from storefronts and counters to more formal dining rooms. Great wine is everywhere. Here are a dozen places to find an excellent glass.\n\nShoreditch is sort of the Williamsburg of London, and Brat is the epitome of a great Shoreditch restaurant, effortlessly cool and seemingly uncomplicated, yet exceptional. Everything is cooked in an open kitchen over wood, and smoke permeates the spare, dimly lit dining room. The space pulses with warm energy, and the food is terrific: silken, intense crab soup; spicy beef tartare served with lettuce wraps; a venison chop full of flavor; rice served with roasted duck in a \u201cpersonal wok,\u201d the base crisp like the bottom of a Korean bibimbap. The wine list leans natural, but the classics are not ignored and great choices abound. I drank a 2020 poulsard from B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte & St\u00e9phane Tissot in the Jura, made without sulfur dioxide, spicy and alive. Medlar is in an area of Chelsea known as World\u2019s End, yet this smart, unpretentious white-tablecloth bistro is a delightful reason to see life through. A two-course lunch for roughly $50 might include crisp pork croquettes in a celeriac-and-apple r\u00e9moulade followed by Cornish brill, a flatfish, with a hazelnut-and-truffle pesto, both thoughtful combinations of textures and contrasting flavors. Medlar offers a serious cheese selection, and the wine list, put together by Melania Battiston, is wide-ranging and well-priced, with plenty of the classics but also many less-familiar options from Europe, Australia, South Africa and the United States. When it opened in 2010, Brawn, an unprepossessing brick corner restaurant in Bethnal Green in the East End, was one of London\u2019s natural-wine pioneers. Now, it\u2019s one of dozens of casual, hip places, with two significant differences: The extensive list of natural wines is beautifully chosen, and the food is outstanding. An appetizer of cuttlefish, chickpeas and \u2019nduja was savory and spicy in perfect balance; the pastas, both a lovely agnolotti stuffed with pumpkin in a sage-and-butter sauce and a spaghetti in a hearty rag\u00f9 of pork shoulder, were extraordinary. I loved an expressive 2021 Roche B\u00e9zigon from Jean-Christophe Garnier, a Loire chenin blanc that is difficult to find in the United States. Noble Rot started as a cheeky wine zine. Now it has expanded to an empire with restaurants, a retail shop, a book and an import business. The secret? Exquisite taste, an unpretentious attitude and a sense of humor. Its second restaurant, in a tight but comfortable townhouse in Soho, seems perennially packed for the classic bistro fare and the exceedingly deep wine list. You could start by exploring the world of English sparkling wine \u2014 the list offers seven options, more than most places. The list is also mostly European, and you can drink exceedingly well for under $75, from an excellent selection of Beaujolais, for example. But if you can splurge, this is a place to do it, because you can find some aged treasures, like a wonderful 1978 St.-Julien from Ch\u00e2teau L\u00e9oville Barton, with textbook complex, savory flavors, for roughly $190. The food lives up to the wine. We had lamb chops with a welcome muttony tang, and an excellent rabbit loin.\n\nBy day, 40 Maltby Street, under a trestle in Bermondsey, is a retail and takeout shop, selling sandwiches and all manner of orange wines, p\u00e9tillants naturels and other products of the wine counterculture. In the evenings, and for Saturday lunch, it becomes a tiny wine bar that does not take reservations. It\u2019s close, it\u2019s loud, and it\u2019s terrific and unusual. I managed to squeeze into the bar for a Saturday lunch of smooth, savory chestnut-and-Jerusalem artichoke soup and a turnip quiche with pickled chanterelles and a flaky, flavorful crust. I watched two chefs working like short-order cooks, and drank a glass of ros\u00e9 p\u00e9t-nat \u2014 sweet, salty and dry \u2014 from Costadil\u00e0 in the Veneto region of Italy. Saturday is a great time to go. Nearby, the Maltby Street Market, a series of shops and food stalls, is great for people watching and further consumption.\n\nIn contrast to the profusion of bistros, wine bars and gastro pubs that characterize so much of modern urban dining, Trivet in Bermondsey is an exception: a bright, cleanly designed restaurant that my mother would have termed Danish Modern, with food that shows a chef\u2019s skilled touch, and an unusual wine list arranged in order of when a region first produced wine. This means a fascinating list, headed by bottles from Georgia, Armenia and Turkey along with the Middle East. They are worth exploration. I\u2019ve never had a wine made of the akhtanak grape before, but an Armenian red, a 2015 from Voskevaz, was structured, firm and complex. You could easily skip forward in history for solid selections from relative newcomers, like France and Italy, but where\u2019s the fun in that? The food is equally designed and earthy, like a feathery sweetbread with smoked maitake mushrooms and pickled lingonberry, a balance of textures and sweet, sour and smoky flavors, or meaty squab with persimmon and roasted carrots. The chef and sommelier, Jonny Lake and Isa Bal, came from Fat Duck, Heston Blumenthal\u2019s three -Michelin- starred restaurant. Nonetheless, Trivet is warmly informal.\n\nXavier Rousset owns a small group of restaurants that put wine front and center. At Blandford Comptoir in Marylebone, a discreet spot with marble-topped tables and a marble counter that would be great for single diners, Mr. Rousset and the sommelier, Andi Harabagiu, have assembled an exceptional wine list with a focus on the Rh\u00f4ne Valley. It\u2019s not inexpensive, though you can easily drink well for under $75 a bottle. But the glory is in the Hermitages, Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Papes and other Rh\u00f4ne appellations, which are not all cheap. I drank a sublime Jean-Louis Chave estate St.-Joseph 2016, one of the best St.-Josephs, for about $175, and it was memorable. The food is what Americans once called continental, or pan-European. I had a robust boeuf bourguignon and a walnut tart that could not have been better.\n\nThe Sunday roast is a beloved tradition in homes and pubs across Britain. The Quality Chop House in Clerkenwell is a great, if filling, place to enjoy the experience. This 150-year-old eating house has been rejuvenated by a small restaurant group into an inviting, informal bastion of English meat-eating, the kind of place you could imagine yourself pounding the table for a joint of stag. Nothing fancy here, just wooden pews and chairs, bare wood tables and jovial servers. I ordered a classic roast pork (tender Mangalitsa collar) with apple sauce, which came with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, broccoli and red cabbage. But first was an extraordinary cup of \u201cgame tea,\u201d a rich, complex broth that deserved contemplation. After that, food seemed to arrive in an avalanche. One shouldn\u2019t plan another meal, or, really, anything after a Sunday roast like this. You could get fancy with wine, as the eclectic list does not ignore the high end, but a 2020 Fleurie Ponci\u00e9, a gently fruity cru Beaujolais from Du Grappin, was perfect for the occasion.\n\nLocal Thai? The menu is influenced by northern Thai cuisine, but the ingredients at Kiln, in Soho, are all from England, and the founder is Ben Chapman, also of Brat. While the restaurant has a cellar dining room, the real fun is in the casual, street-level counter where the cooks work over charcoal, pausing to chat with diners. Dishes like northern-style laap sausage; pollock in a sour curry; or glass noodles baked with pork belly and crab in a clay pot are excellent and full-throated spicy. The wines are all natural, with quite a few by-the-glass options. While many seem obscure, the wines I had \u2014 a sparkling chardonnay-pinot blanc from Nibiru in the Kamptal region of Austria, and a counoise, vinified as a white, from Les Fr\u00e8res Soulier in Languedoc \u2014 went beautifully with the spicy cuisine.\n\nSince 1995, Chez Bruce in Wandsworth in southwest London has been a place for special occasions \u2014 anniversaries, graduations or dates to impress. It\u2019s fittingly old-fashioned and serious, though by no means solemn, with celebratory dishes like chateaubriand and hare Wellington. The wine list, likewise, is appropriately classic. You can drink a good assyrtiko or trousseau, but special meals often require special wines, and Chez Bruce is up to the challenge with excellent selections of Champagne and sparkling wine, half-bottles and deep European selections, often with a little age. With a savory onion tart imbued with buttery Lancashire cheese, and rabbit stuffed with shallots, prunes and potatoes, I drank a 2006 Hermitage from Bernard Faurie, a brilliant Northern Rh\u00f4ne wine that seemed young enough that I could plan to return for another go in a few years.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "When I was 7 or 8, I spent hours tinkering and experimenting to figure out how to make parachutes, fashioned from old scarves, open more quickly each time I tossed them into the air. This required careful observation to determine how small design changes affected performance. My single-mindedness, verging on obsession, was probably because I was autistic. At the time I loved a book about famous inventors and their inventions. It impressed me that Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers were so single-minded in figuring out how to make a light bulb or an airplane. They spent lots of time obsessively perfecting their inventions. It is likely that some of the inventors in that book also were autistic.\n\nWe hear a great deal about the need to fix the infrastructure in this country, but we are too focused on the things that need improving and updating rather than the people who will be able to do the work. For over 25 years, I designed equipment to handle livestock and worked with the highly skilled people who built the equipment. When I look back at all the projects I designed for large companies, I estimate that 20 percent of the skilled welders and drafting technicians were autistic or dyslexic, or had A.D.H.D. I remember two people with autism and who held numerous patents for mechanical devices they invented and who sold equipment to many companies. Our visual thinking skills were key to our success.\n\nToday, we want our students to be well rounded; we should think about making sure that the education we provide is as well. At the same time, I wager that the people who will fix America\u2019s infrastructure have spent hours and hours on one thing, whether it be Legos, violin or chess \u2014 hyper-focus is a classic sign of neurodivergent thinking and it\u2019s critical for innovation and invention.\n\nI often get asked what I would do to improve both elementary and high school. The first step would be to put more of an emphasis on hands-on classes such as art, music, sewing, woodworking, cooking, theater, auto mechanics and welding. I would have hated school if the hands-on classes had been removed, as so many have been today. These classes also expose students \u2014 especially neurodivergent students \u2014 to skills that could become a career. Exposure is key. Too many students are growing up who have never used a tool. They are completely removed from the world of the practical.\n\nDespite my accomplishments, if I were a young person today, I would have difficulty graduating from high school because I could not pass algebra. It was too abstract, with no visual correlations. This is true for many of today\u2019s students who get labeled bad at math, students who might otherwise pass alternative math courses such as statistics that would also apply to real-life work situations. There is too much emphasis in school on testing and not enough on career outcomes. My poor performance on the math portion of the SAT prohibited me from getting into veterinary school, but today I am a university professor in animal sciences and I am invited to speak to groups of veterinarians to advise them on their work. The true measure of an education isn\u2019t what grades students get today, but where they are 10 years later.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Frigid Fringe Festival in New York said it would no longer bill itself as \u201cuncensored\u201d after deciding not to move ahead with a performance it deemed anti-trans.\n\nSince its 2007 founding, the Frigid Fringe Festival in New York has selected the plays it produces randomly, like many other fringe festivals around the world that aim to highlight voices from outside the theatrical establishment. It boasted that it was both \u201cunjuried,\u201d since it did not rely on gatekeeping panels, and \u201cuncensored.\u201d But that changed this past fall, when Frigid decided for the first time that it would not stage one of the productions it had chosen. A staffer at the festival had red-flagged the work, \u201cPoems on Gender,\u201d after its author, David Lee Morgan, submitted a blurb drawn from the show that began: \u201cThere are two sexes, male and female.\u201d Further investigation led organizers to conclude that it \u201cfeatured material we deem to be anti-trans.\u201d In canceling its production of \u201cPoems on Gender,\u201d Frigid announced that it would stop calling itself \u201cuncensored,\u201d and that it would reserve the right to withdraw future plays. \u201cOur commitment to freedom of expression does not obligate us to lend our efforts to platform what we consider to be hate speech, or even just very offensive and hurtful speech,\u201d it said in a news release. It added, \u201cIn this case we choose to just say no.\u201d The festival was \u201cuncensored\u201d no longer, becoming the latest example of a wider rebalancing in the worlds of culture, publishing and academia, as many institutions that once emphasized freedom of expression and artistic license have curbed speech that they deem hateful or offensive to members of marginalized groups.\n\nMorgan, a busker and spoken-word poet based in London who performs \u201cPoems on Gender\u201d as a recited monologue, said in an interview that he did not expect Frigid to tolerate absolutely everything. \u201cIf I were presenting a recruiting film for the Ku Klux Klan,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d be astounded if they\u2019d be fine with putting it on.\u201d On Being Transgender in America\n\u2022 None Feeling Unsafe: Intimidation and violence against gay and transgender Americans has spread this year \u2014 driven heavily, extremism experts say, by Intimidation and violence against gay and transgender Americans has spread this year \u2014 driven heavily, extremism experts say, by increasingly inflammatory political messaging\n\u2022 None Puberty Blockers: These drugs can ease anguish among young transgender people and buy time to weigh options.

But he disputed that his show, which he performed last year at the prominent Edinburgh Festival Fringe, was deserving of censorship. \u201cIs it reactionary?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it anti-trans? Is it bigotry to say there are two sexes, male and female?\u201d Erez Ziv, a founder of Frigid New York and its managing artistic director, said he could not ask his increasingly diverse staff, which includes several transgender and nonbinary people, to be part of a production that denied their realities. The Frigid Fringe Festival, which will run in February and March, supplies shows with theatrical space and publicity, and tech and front-of-house workers. Productions keep all box office revenue. (Frigid relies on grants and small fees from the productions.) \u201cIn November, I boastfully said to an entire room full of fringe producers in North America that I would allow a show to happen no matter what,\u201d Ziv said. \u201cBut then it happened: We actually got a show that I just couldn\u2019t ask my staff to work.\u201d\n\nBefore deciding, Ziv, who never reads production scripts for Frigid, viewed several online videos of Morgan performing other works. He also consulted a colleague: the co-artistic director at Frigid, Jimmy Lovett, partly because Lovett is trans. Lovett said that some of Morgan\u2019s online performances of related works were \u201cvery minimizing of our experiences\u201d and framed transition-related surgery and other medical care as \u201cdamaging to the body rather than necessary and healthy for the individual.\u201d In sometimes elliptical language, \u201cPoems on Gender\u201d raises questions about how some people define their genders (\u201cYou tell me I can\u2019t be your friend/Unless I believe you are a real woman/I can\u2019t do that\u201d) and about transition-related medical care (\u201cYou took a rainbow and forged it into a knife\u201d). Morgan, who grew up in Washington State, describes himself as left-wing and feminist and said that \u201cPoems on Gender\u201d was partly inspired by conversations with trans friends from the spoken-word poetry scene. \u201cI\u2019m looking at people I have a lot of respect and unity with, and then seeing where we disagree,\u201d he said, noting that he believes some of the friendships have ended because of his views. Frigid\u2019s evolution away from its stage-anything ethos is striking, because the festival exists precisely to ensure that even unusual or outr\u00e9 works get a chance to go up in New York City. Fringe festivals share a mandate to elevate edgier voices. The concept originated when troupes that were not invited to the first Edinburgh International Festival in 1947 put on a counter-festival, which a journalist later described as \u201cround the fringe of official festival drama.\u201d They have earned a reputation for giving opportunities to new talent: the hit Broadway musical \u201cSix,\u201d about the wives of Henry VIII, was written by college students and was one of the 3,398 shows the Edinburgh Festival Fringe put on in 2017.\n\nXela Batchelder, a veteran fringe producer who studied fringe festivals for her Ph.D. dissertation, said that generally \u201cthe audience is the curator,\u201d and that it would be a challenge for festivals to begin deciding which works to stage and which to rule out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for the arts organizations and the artists trying to figure out how to work through all this,\u201d she said. The fringe model has been tested in recent years. The Chicago Fringe Festival, which like Frigid selected works entirely by lottery, faced backlash in 2017 for staging \u201cA Virtuous Pedophile.\u201d (Its author, Sean Neely, said the play did not advocate pedophilia.) The outcry was \u201cvery detrimental\u201d to the festival, said Anne Cauley, its executive director at the time, and the festival\u2019s largest foundation sponsor declined to renew its support the next year. The festival ceased after 2018. The Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals, whose guiding principles call for convening no juries for selecting plays and allowing no interference with artistic content, added a new plank in 2017 that said, \u201cFestivals will promote and model inclusivity, diversity and multiculturalism.\u201d A spokeswoman for the association, Michele Gallant, said that Frigid, which is one of its members, had still abided by the principle that says \u201cfestival producers do not interfere with the artistic content of each performance,\u201d because it had not altered the show \u2014 but simply pulled it entirely. Morgan still hopes to take \u201cPoems on Gender\u201d to other fringe festivals. He won the Canadian association\u2019s lottery in November, which gives him entry to fringe festivals next summer in the cities of Victoria and Vancouver, in British Columbia. The Vancouver Fringe declined to comment, and an official at the Victoria Fringe did not respond to a request for comment.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMany people who want to work can\u2019t because of long-term health problems, a persistent issue that is causing Britain\u2019s economy to go \u201cinto reverse.\u201d\n\nChristina Barratt was used to the 12- to 14-hour days. For years, she would get into her car each morning and set out to department stores and other retailers all over northwest England, selling greeting cards for a large manufacturer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very demanding, busy job,\u201d she said, recalling how she had to make sales, manage client accounts and grow the business, while often traveling long distances. In March 2020, at the age of 50, Ms. Barratt got Covid. She hasn\u2019t been able to work since. Ms. Barratt is among 3.5 million people \u2014 or about one in 12 working-age adults in Britain \u2014 who have long-term health conditions and are not working or looking for work. The number ballooned during the first two years of the pandemic when more than half a million more people reported they had a long-term sickness, with physical and mental health conditions, according to analysis by economists at the Bank of England. The sharp rise in ill health is a startling problem itself, but there has also been a growing awareness in Britain about the negative effects on the economy of having so many people unable to work. Sickness is adding to the growing sense of malaise in a country troubled by high inflation and the economic costs of Brexit, where the National Health Service is overwhelmed and workers across industries are striking in ever larger numbers, coming after a year of severe political upheaval.\n\nWith the unemployment rate near its lowest point in half a century, businesses have loudly complained that they have been unable to hire enough workers, leaving the government grappling with how to expand the labor market. Before the pandemic, a growing labor market had been \u201cthe single cylinder of growth in the economic engine,\u201d Andy Haldane, the former chief economist of the Bank of England, said in November during a lecture at the Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization. It \u201chas now gone into reverse gear.\u201d Britain is in \u201ca situation where for the first time, probably since the Industrial Revolution,\u201d health and well-being are in retreat and acting as a brake on economic growth, said Mr. Haldane, who currently serves as the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, an organization in London that seeks practical solutions to social issues. The economy is probably already in a recession, according to forecasts by the Bank of England and others, and is expected to return to only meager growth in 2024. Some economists have warned that shortages of workers could deepen the cost-of-living crisis if it causes employers to raise wages to attract workers in a way that threatens to entrench high inflation into the economy. That could prompt the central bank to keep interest rates high, pushing up borrowing costs and restraining the economy. At the heart of the problem is a high economic inactivity rate that has barely budged despite the end of pandemic lockdowns, a boom in labor demand and a high cost of living. As of October, over half a million more people were counted as inactive than before the pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics. In a separate study looking at data for the first two years of the pandemic, Jonathan Haskel and Josh Martin, economists at the Bank of England, found that nearly 90 percent of the increase in economic inactivity could be attributed to people who had long-term sickness.\n\nContributing to the rise in sickness are not only tens of thousands of cases of long Covid, which Ms. Barratt is suffering from, but also a vast backlog of people \u2014 about seven million \u2014 with a variety of health problems who are on waiting lists for N.H.S. care. The latest numbers add to a longer-term trend. In the 25 years before the pandemic, the tally of people reporting long-term sickness grew about half a percent a year. Since then, it accelerated to 4 percent a year, according to the study by Mr. Haskel and Mr. Martin. Britain\u2019s aging population means there are more sick people, but \u201cthe prevalence of poor health has been growing\u201d as well, said David Finch of the Health Foundation, which has studied links between illness and economic inactivity. In the past few years, the foundation found, there has been a large increase in the number of people with cardiovascular problems, mental illness and a range of other ailments, which would include respiratory conditions and long Covid symptoms. Britain is one of just seven countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that still have a higher rate of economic inactivity than they did before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics reported. The United States is also in this group, but its missing workers are mostly explained by retirement and a decline in participation by middle-aged men without college degrees, rather than sickness. The increase in the rate of economic inactivity in Britain is more than twice as large as the increase in the United States. These missing workers face a number of barriers in returning to work. For some, the severity of their health condition prevents them from working, while others are unable to return to the job they used to do. Ms. Barratt, the greeting card saleswoman, has no illusions about going back to a similar job. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could do that kind of role any more,\u201d Ms. Barratt said. \u201cI\u2019m just not well enough to sustain any kind of level of energy.\u201d Just getting up and down the stairs at home is a challenge, she said.\n\nShe is feeling the strain of living on government benefits for more than two years and would like to return to work. \u201cIf I continue to have this condition, which can go up and down in severity, I\u2019d have to find some kind of employment that was very flexible,\u201d she added. Although there has been a worrying increase in the number of economically inactive people \u2014 sick or not \u2014 who don\u2019t want to work, there are still 1.7 million who do but are unable to look for a job and start work soon, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long-term issue in keeping people with disabilities in the workplace,\u201d said Kirsty Stanley, an occupational therapist. There are a lot of challenges, including some employers not understanding legal requirements to make reasonable accommodations for employees with health problems, Ms. Stanley said. She is an associate for Long Covid Work, a group that works with unions and employment groups to improve access to work for people with long Covid. Mr. Haskel and Mr. Martin estimate that there are 96,000 people who are economically inactive because of long Covid. Ms. Stanley, who also suffers from long Covid, said one problem was that the gradual period for returning to work that employers offered to people after a long absence didn\u2019t work well for those with long Covid. \u201cThey basically expect people to go from potentially zero to 100\u201d within four to six weeks, she said. \u201cWhat happens is people crash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been so poor for so long as a student nurse,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thrilled to be working, work for the N.H.S. and felt very proud of the work I was doing. And then Covid hit.\u201d \u201cI was very early on in my career,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t know if I can ever go back again.\u201d At age 36, he said he felt \u201cstuck in a professional limbo,\u201d where he could not do the job he spent years training for but was too unwell to train for something else. Until September, Mr. Borlase received full pay because of a provision for N.H.S. workers with Covid. Since then, Mr. Borlase has been receiving reduced wages from sick pay, which will expire in April. Delays in getting health treatment have made it difficult for Andrea Slivkova, 43, to return to work. A Czech native who came to Britain 10 years ago, she left her job cleaning offices in mid-2021 because of pain from a prolapsed pelvic organ. It was more than a year before she could have the surgery to address the problem. Since then, she said, she is still unwell but has not been able to have a follow-up appointment with a specialist. Last summer, she was told it would be a five-month wait. \u201cThey told me that the waiting list is long because other people are waiting, too,\u201d Ms. Slivkova said, with her daughter, Kristyna Dudyova, translating from Czech.\n\nMs. Slivkova still hasn\u2019t returned to work. She described the strain of having a physical health condition but also the struggle to navigate the health care system and the financial stress of relying on government benefits. Ms. Dudyova recalled how her mother used to be a workaholic, who found time to bake, go to the gym and work multiple jobs if necessary, all while raising her and her younger brother. \u201cBut now everything is just gone,\u201d she said.",

After more than five hours, the authorities said that the military police had retaken control of the site. The assault was the violent culmination of incessant rhetorical attacks on the nation\u2019s electoral systems by Bolsonaro, who lost a close runoff to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, in October. Lula, who was in S\u00e3o Paulo when the protests erupted, signed an emergency decree allowing the federal government to take additional measures to restore order. Brazil\u2019s justice minister said that about 200 people had been arrested. Local officials said that the authorities were investigating reports of rioters attacking journalists, smashing windows of ministry buildings and carrying bladed weapons. Bolsonaro: The former leader has been staying in Florida, where he traveled late last month as his presidency was coming to a close. Since his election loss, his supporters have been camped outside military bases across the country and had called on the armed forces to take control of the government and halt Lula\u2019s recent inauguration.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military commanders have welcomed to their ranks thousands of volunteers from outside Ukraine. They include Chechens, who are refugees from Russia itself, as well as foreign citizens from nearby nations, like Georgia, that have a history of opposition to Moscow and the leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president. Several Chechen units have joined Ukraine in its fight against Russia in recent years, following the 2014 uprising of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Many of the volunteers were already living in Ukraine, either for work or seeking refuge from political oppression back home, and were motivated to join the fight by historical grievances of dispossession and suppression by Moscow. Some have struggled with visas and residency permits, and their eagerness to join the fight has aroused suspicions among some Ukrainian officials and commanders, who are on high alert for saboteurs.\n\nChina yesterday opened its borders for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, welcoming visitors without strict quarantine requirements and allowing its citizens to go overseas as the travel period for Lunar New Year begins. Families who have been kept apart for weddings, funerals, birthdays and graduations are finally preparing to reunite. In Hong Kong\u2019s airport, hundreds of people waited to check in for flights to the mainland, but the arrivals hall was more quiet. Many of the city\u2019s border checkpoints were reopened; empty transportation halls filled up with groups of people, and shuttered storefronts were open once again. But unease has tempered the celebratory mood. Covid has ripped through China in recent weeks, causing chaos in hospitals. Beijing\u2019s decision to open its borders has left many in the diaspora reeling and spurred some to delay returning to see family members until the Covid outbreak has abated. Impact: Nations around the world are eager to welcome the return of Chinese tourists, who spent $250 billion a year overseas before the pandemic. Their abrupt disappearance in early 2020 plunged many tour guides and travel operators into bankruptcy.\n\nAn art history lecturer in the U.S. showed her class a 14th-century painting of the Prophet Muhammad that scholars herald as a masterpiece. She lost her job. The events have created a national controversy, which has pitted advocates of academic liberty and free speech, as well as some Muslim art historians, against Muslims who believe that showing the image of Prophet Muhammad is always sacrilegious. Lionel Messi, Barcelona\u2019s political pawn: The World Cup winner left Spain, but the power of his name is still being used by his former club to curry favor. The hated rivals who need each other more than ever: The Super League has brought Barcelona and Real Madrid together in a far cry from the wars between Ronaldo and Messi, Guardiola and Mourinho. Inside Real Madrid\u2019s move to sign Brazil\u2019s best young player: The world wanted Endrick. This is the story of how Real fended off rivals to sign the 16-year-old. From The Times: Naomi Osaka withdrew from the Australian Open. She has not played a tournament since September, when she withdrew from a match in Japan with abdominal pain. In a tight labor market, where employers have had good incentives to accommodate workers\u2019 preferences, it has been easy for workers to make the argument for workplace conditions that suit them \u2014 including \u201cwfh,\u201d or \u201cworking from home,\u201d as a given at least some of the time.\n\nAs layoffs loom, the worker-first era is over. Some prominent chief executives, including David Solomon of Goldman Sachs and Elon Musk of Twitter, have seen an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists say it is not likely. Last year, remote work stabilized well above prepandemic levels, with around 30 percent of full paid working days in the U.S. completed remotely last year, up from around 5 percent in 2019. In surveys, workers favored being remote about 2.8 days per week. Their employers preferred them to be out of office 2.3 days. Employees say they like working remotely because it means no commute and more peace and quiet. But allowing employees to operate outside of the office can also benefit companies. Such flexibility may allow them to pay less, and workers with an option to log in remotely may also take fewer sick days.

That Ukrainian strike, in the occupied eastern city of Makiivka, left at least dozens of Russian soldiers dead and renewed criticism of the Russian military among some prominent supporters of Moscow\u2019s war effort.\n\nAnalysts said Moscow\u2019s claim of a retaliatory attack was likely aimed at placating anger among some Russians over Makiivka. But even some Russian pro-war bloggers, who closely follow military moves, expressed skepticism of the Defense Ministry\u2019s account.\n\nUkrainian authorities acknowledged that there were strikes in Kramatorsk hours before Russia\u2019s announcement, saying on Sunday morning that some buildings had been damaged by missiles, but they reported no casualties.",

            "section": "en Espa\u00f1ol",
            "content": "La investigaci\u00f3n muestra que casi todos los adolescentes estadounidenses se relacionan con sus compa\u00f1eros a trav\u00e9s de las redes sociales: el 97 por ciento se conecta todos los d\u00edas y el 46 por ciento afirma que lo hace \u201ccasi constantemente\u201d.\n\nLos adolescentes que consultaban con frecuencia las redes sociales mostraban una mayor sensibilidad a los comentarios de sus compa\u00f1eros; la causa de los cambios no estaba clara.\n\nEl uso de las redes sociales est\u00e1 relacionado con cambios cerebrales en los adolescentes, seg\u00fan un estudio\n\nEl efecto del uso de las redes sociales en los menores es un \u00e1rea de investigaci\u00f3n muy delicada. Legisladores y padres de familia intentan determinar los resultados de un vasto experimento que ya est\u00e1 en pleno desarrollo. Estudios sucesivos han agregado piezas al rompecabezas y analizan las implicaciones de un flujo casi constante de interacciones virtuales que comienza en la infancia. Un nuevo estudio realizado por neurocient\u00edficos en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte intenta algo nuevo: hace escaneos cerebrales sucesivos a estudiantes de entre 12 y 15 a\u00f1os, un periodo en el que el desarrollo cerebral es especialmente r\u00e1pido. Los investigadores descubrieron que los chicos que de manera habitual revisan sus redes sociales alrededor de los 12 a\u00f1os mostraban una trayectoria distinta, en la que su sensibilidad a las recompensas sociales de sus compa\u00f1eros se incrementaba con el tiempo. Los adolescentes con menos participaci\u00f3n en las redes sociales siguieron el camino opuesto: un inter\u00e9s cada vez menor en las recompensas sociales.\n\nEl estudio, publicado el martes 3 de enero en la revista JAMA Pediatrics, es uno de los primeros intentos de registrar los cambios en la funci\u00f3n cerebral relacionados con el uso de las redes sociales durante un periodo de a\u00f1os. Los autores reconocen que el estudio tiene limitaciones importantes. Como la adolescencia es un periodo de expansi\u00f3n de las relaciones sociales, las diferencias cerebrales podr\u00edan reflejar un giro natural hacia los compa\u00f1eros, lo que podr\u00eda estar impulsando un uso m\u00e1s frecuente de las redes sociales. \u201cNo podemos hacer afirmaciones causales de que las redes sociales est\u00e1n modificando el cerebro\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Eva H. Telzer, profesora asociada de Psicolog\u00eda y Neurociencia en la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, campus Chapel Hill, y una de las autoras del estudio. Seek out professional support. A child who expresses suicidal thoughts may benefit from a mental health evaluation and treatment. You can start by speaking with your child\u2019s pediatrician or a mental health professional. Sin embargo, Telzer agreg\u00f3: \u201cLos adolescentes que suelen revisar sus redes sociales muestran cambios bastante dram\u00e1ticos en la forma en que sus cerebros responden, lo que podr\u00eda tener consecuencias a largo plazo hasta bien entrada la edad adulta, y de cierta manera sentar las bases para el desarrollo cerebral con el tiempo\u201d. Un equipo de investigadores estudi\u00f3 a un grupo \u00e9tnicamente diverso de 169 estudiantes de sexto y s\u00e9ptimo grado de una escuela en la zona rural de Carolina del Norte. Los dividi\u00f3 en grupos de acuerdo con la frecuencia con la que, seg\u00fan informaron los mismos estudiantes, revisaban Facebook, Instagram y Snapchat.\n\nAlrededor de los 12 a\u00f1os, los estudiantes ya mostraban distintos patrones de comportamiento. Los usuarios habituales informaron revisar sus redes 15 o m\u00e1s veces al d\u00eda; los usuarios moderados consultaban entre una y 14 veces; y los usuarios no habituales revisaban sus redes menos de una vez al d\u00eda. Los sujetos fueron sometidos a esc\u00e1neres cerebrales completos tres veces, en intervalos de aproximadamente un a\u00f1o, mientras jugaban un juego computarizado que les daba recompensas y castigos en forma de compa\u00f1eros sonrientes o con el ce\u00f1o fruncido. Mientras realizaban la tarea, los usuarios frecuentes mostraron una activaci\u00f3n creciente de tres \u00e1reas del cerebro: los circuitos de procesamiento de recompensas, los cuales tambi\u00e9n responden a experiencias como ganar dinero o asumir riesgos; las regiones cerebrales que determinan la relevancia, es decir la selecci\u00f3n de lo que destaca en el entorno; y la corteza prefrontal, la cual ayuda con la regulaci\u00f3n y el control. Los resultados mostraron que \u201clos adolescentes que crecen revisando las redes sociales con m\u00e1s frecuencia se est\u00e1n volviendo hipersensibles a las respuestas de sus compa\u00f1eros\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Telzer. Los hallazgos no captan la magnitud de los cambios cerebrales, solo su trayectoria. Adem\u00e1s, los autores afirmaron que no queda claro si los cambios son beneficiosos o perjudiciales. La sensibilidad social podr\u00eda ser adaptativa y podr\u00eda mostrar que los adolescentes est\u00e1n aprendiendo a conectar con otros, o podr\u00eda generar ansiedad social y depresi\u00f3n si las necesidades sociales no son satisfechas. Algunos investigadores en el campo de las redes sociales advirtieron que no se deben sacar conclusiones radicales basadas en estos hallazgos. \u201cEl estudio muestra que la manera en que usamos las redes sociales en un momento de nuestras vidas influye en la forma en que se desarrolla nuestro cerebro, pero no sabemos cu\u00e1nto, o si eso es algo positivo o negativo\u201d, afirm\u00f3 Jeff Hancock, director fundador del Laboratorio de Redes Sociales de la Universidad de Stanford, quien no particip\u00f3 en el estudio. Hancock afirm\u00f3 que existen muchas otras variables que podr\u00edan haber contribuido a estos cambios.\n\n\u201c\u00bfY si, por ejemplo, estas personas se unieron a un nuevo equipo \u2014de hockey o de voleibol\u2014 y comenzaron a tener muchas m\u00e1s interacciones sociales por eso?\u201d, cuestion\u00f3. Podr\u00eda ser, agreg\u00f3, que los investigadores est\u00e9n \u201cdetectando el desarrollo de la extroversi\u00f3n, y las personas extrovertidas son m\u00e1s propensas a revisar sus redes sociales\u201d. Hancock describi\u00f3 el estudio como \u201cun trabajo muy sofisticado\u201d, que contribuye a las investigaciones que han surgido recientemente y que muestra que la sensibilidad a las redes sociales var\u00eda de una persona a otra. \u201cHay personas que tienen un estado neurol\u00f3gico que se traduce en que sean m\u00e1s propensas a sentirse atra\u00eddas a revisar con mayor frecuencia\u201d, afirm\u00f3. \u201cNo todos somos iguales, y debemos dejar de pensar que las redes sociales significan lo mismo para todos\u201d. Durante la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, las redes sociales han modificado las experiencias centrales de la adolescencia, un periodo de r\u00e1pido desarrollo cerebral. Casi todos los adolescentes estadounidenses interact\u00faan a trav\u00e9s de las redes sociales: el 97 por ciento se conecta a diario y el 46 por ciento reporta estar en l\u00ednea \u201ccasi constantemente\u201d, seg\u00fan el Centro de Investigaciones Pew. Los adolescentes de las comunidades negras y latinas pasan m\u00e1s horas en las redes sociales que los adolescentes blancos, seg\u00fan investigaciones. Los investigadores han documentado una variedad de efectos en la salud mental de los ni\u00f1os. Algunos estudios han relacionado el uso de las redes sociales con la depresi\u00f3n y la ansiedad, mientras que otros han encontrado poca conexi\u00f3n. Un estudio de 2018 de adolescentes lesbianas, gays y bisexuales revel\u00f3 que las redes sociales les brindaban validaci\u00f3n y apoyo, pero tambi\u00e9n los expon\u00edan a discursos de odio. Los expertos que revisaron el estudio afirmaron que debido a que los investigadores midieron el uso de las redes sociales entre los estudiantes solo una vez, alrededor de los 12 a\u00f1os, era imposible saber c\u00f3mo hab\u00eda cambiado con el tiempo o descartar otros factores que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edan haber afectado el desarrollo del cerebro.\n\nSin m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre otros aspectos de la vida de los estudiantes, \u201ces dif\u00edcil discernir hasta qu\u00e9 punto las diferencias espec\u00edficas en el desarrollo cerebral est\u00e1n relacionadas con el uso de las redes sociales\u201d, afirma Adriana Galv\u00e1n, especialista en desarrollo cerebral adolescente de la Universidad de California en Los \u00c1ngeles, que no particip\u00f3 en el estudio. Jennifer Pfeifer, profesora de psicolog\u00eda de la Universidad de Oreg\u00f3n y codirectora del Consejo Cient\u00edfico Nacional sobre la Adolescencia, dijo: \u201cToda experiencia se acumula y se refleja en el cerebro\u201d. \u201cCreo que hay que ponerlo en este contexto\u201d, dijo. \u201cMuchas otras experiencias que tienen los adolescentes tambi\u00e9n estar\u00e1n cambiando el cerebro. As\u00ed que no queremos entrar en una especie de p\u00e1nico moral sobre la idea de que la utilizaci\u00f3n de las redes sociales est\u00e1 cambiando el cerebro de los adolescentes\u201d. Telzer, una de las autoras del estudio, describi\u00f3 la creciente sensibilidad a la retroalimentaci\u00f3n social como \u201cni buena ni mala\u201d. \u201cLes est\u00e1 ayudando a conectar con los dem\u00e1s y a obtener recompensas de las cosas que son comunes en su mundo social, que es participar en interacciones sociales en l\u00ednea\u201d, dijo. \u201cEsta es la nueva norma\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cEs importante comprender c\u00f3mo influye este nuevo mundo digital en los adolescentes. Puede estar asociado a cambios en el cerebro, pero eso puede ser para bien o para mal. A\u00fan no conocemos necesariamente las implicaciones a largo plazo\u201d. Ellen Barry cubre salud mental.

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "NASHVILLE \u2014 The winter storm that swept in just before Christmas, moving from the West Coast to the East, was a slow-motion devastation. For a week, it was all meteorologists could talk about \u2014 temperatures dropping tens of degrees in a matter of minutes, motorists stranded, flights canceled, power disrupted across the land. It was 52 degrees here the day the front was due, but the birds were already making their cold-weather plans. The dominant bluebird down at our end of the neighborhood spent much of it sitting on top of the sunny nest box in our front yard. He wasn\u2019t laying claim to the box for nesting season, which is still months away, but for shelter. On bitter nights, whole families of bluebirds will crowd in to escape a storm. The next morning, sure enough, it was zero degrees outside, with wind chills registering 20 below. Hardly a bird or squirrel ventured out, not even for the suet I had stocked up on during my own storm preparations. The electrical grid was in danger of going down amid unprecedented demand. The Tennessee Valley Authority ordered local power companies to conduct rolling blackouts, the first in its history. Around here, December highs typically reach the 50s \u2014 into the 60s on sunny days \u2014 but we didn\u2019t get above freezing again until four days after the front arrived. By then, half the evergreen plants in my yard were dead.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend relying on meteorology by bluebird, but the natural world always has something to tell us about the ecosystems we belong to, and birds are not their only soothsayers. In springtime, the early green-up of invasive plants like bush honeysuckle and Bradford pear signal how thoroughly they are outcompeting our native plants. (Don\u2019t believe me? Do an image search for kudzu in the American South.) And in winter, as it turns out, the plants that didn\u2019t survive the storm were overwhelmingly nonnatives, at least from what I could tell in my admittedly unscientific survey of Nashville vegetation \u2014 another sign that these plants did not evolve for this ecosystem. Popular landscaping evergreens like Japanese cedar, skip laurel (which comes from the Mediterranean region), English boxwood and Japanese euonymus are now some dead shade of brown, while the undeterred Eastern red cedars and Southern white pines and American hollies remain a glorious green. This is only a general rule, of course. Many of the Chinese hollies and yews, so popular among landscapers and big-box nursery departments, also seem to have escaped the storm unscathed. And it\u2019s too soon to say whether the now-dormant hardwoods \u2014 native or otherwise \u2014 will leaf out on schedule come springtime or if they also perished in the storm. There\u2019s a chance, too, that some of the evergreens will make a comeback. People here are nonetheless lamenting the loss of what appears to be every evergreen tree and shrub in their yards. Given the extent of this storm, homeowners across the country are surely feeling the same grief. I understand the attachment to plants that have no place in this place. Before the temperatures dropped so low, we had several of them. Some, like the horribly invasive euonymus and nandinas, were planted by this house\u2019s original owners, so long ago that it would take a backhoe to dislodge them. But others we foolishly introduced ourselves. My mother planted the two stands of Japanese aucuba and quite a few yews when we bought this house almost three decades ago, but I can\u2019t blame Mom for the four skip laurels: I planted those. An inept nurseryman told me they were native to Tennessee, and I believed him. These days I know better than to trust a garden center employee without taking the trouble to confirm. Now the aucuba and the laurels are dead, and so are the euonymus and nandinas. And while I could never bring myself to cut down anything my mother planted from cuttings from my childhood home, I\u2019m relieved they\u2019re all gone.\n\nThere is room now for even more of the native plants that my husband and I have been cultivating for years. We\u2019ll replace the skip laurels with native mountain laurels, the aucuba with American hollies, the euonymus and nandina with inkberry and devilwood and hobblebush. These plants can play the same landscaping roles as their nonnative counterparts, but unlike the nonnatives, they will also produce flowers and berries that feed an amazing array of insects and songbirds, often during winter and early spring, the times of year when other food sources are scarce. I\u2019m not a gardening expert, but I don\u2019t need to be. Nobody needs to be anymore. Information about which plants are native to which growing zones is readily available from apps like iNaturalist, PlantNet and Picture This, as well as from the searchable databases of national organizations like Audubon, the National Wildlife Federation and the Xerces Society. Some of the best advice comes from state- and region-specific sources, like the websites or social media feeds of native-plant societies, county extension services and university horticulture departments. I rely on the Southeast Exotic Pest Plant Council, which offers a handy chart showing which native plants will fill the same planting niche as popular but wrongheaded landscaping choices. Finding the actual plants I\u2019m looking for \u2014 or the seeds to grow them \u2014 can take a little planning. I\u2019m lucky that Nashville is an easy drive to GroWild, a native-plant nursery and one of the loveliest places in Middle Tennessee, but people without such a nursery nearby can usually find an online supplier that will ship nationally. I confess I wasn\u2019t thinking about the plants in my yard as I watched snow and ice pour from the sky the night the Christmas-week storm arrived. I was thinking about the bluebirds. How many of them had crowded into that little nest box? Were its board walls thick enough to keep them safe in such a cruel wind, in such a pitiless cold? But after the sun finally came out and the wind died down, there were the bluebirds, a host of them, perched along the circumference of the heated birdbath like rosary beads. When spring comes, they will put our nest boxes to another beautiful use, and I will plant more berry-bearing trees and shrubs to sustain them through winter storms yet to come.
