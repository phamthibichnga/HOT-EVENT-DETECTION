It happened at a picnic in the Harz Mountains with Ernst J\u00fcnger, who \u201cleaned over to pick up a sauerkraut and sausage roll, and his lederhosen split with a tremendous crack.\u201d Like Heidegger, Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was not known for his lightness of spirit. He was, in novels and stories like \u201cThe Trial,\u201d \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d and \u201cA Hunger Artist,\u201d the visionary 20th-century distiller of guilt and shame, ill defined and thus quintessentially modern. In the spirit of Johnson\u2019s anecdote about Heidegger, I\u2019ve often recalled that, in his diaries, Kafka reports sitting in a bar in Prague with his friend Max Brod after they\u2019d left an opera. Brod accidentally sprayed soda water all over Kafka, who laughed so hard that seltzer and grenadine shot out of his nose. The cheerful moments of gloomy men. Do they matter? In Kafka\u2019s case, one could argue that they do. He kept his diaries from 1909 to 1923; they end not long before he died in obscurity, at 40, from tuberculosis. Into them he stuffed all manner of things: letters, drafts of stories, aphorisms, dreams, snatches of observation.\n\nKafka did not intend for these diaries to be published; he ordered Brod to burn them unread. As he did with so much of Kafka\u2019s work, Brod, certain of his friend\u2019s genius, published them anyway. Literature owes Brod a debt, even if, as John Updike wrote, Kafka would come to have this in common with Shakespeare: \u201cTheir reputations rest principally on texts they never approved or proofread.\u201d Brod heavily buffed Kafka\u2019s diaries before they saw print. He made them seem more coherent than they were. He pared away the flyspecks and stray hairs and human impulses. He excised passages that appear to express homoeroticism, for example. Gone or disguised, too, were passages about Kafka\u2019s visits to prostitutes. A new, unexpurgated and essential edition of Kafka\u2019s diaries has finally been published in English, more than three decades after this complete text appeared in German. The sole previous English edition, with Brod\u2019s edits, was issued in the late 1940s. The new volume, in a sensitive and briskly idiomatic translation by Ross Benjamin, offers revelation upon revelation. It\u2019s an invaluable addition to Kafka\u2019s oeuvre. Where Brod strove to clean Kafka up and foster a sense that he was, in Benjamin\u2019s words, a \u201csaintly, prophetic genius, whose purity places him at an elevated remove from the world,\u201d this edition scuffs him up and returns him to earth, in an intimate manner that does no injury to our sense of his suffering, or his profound and original gifts.\n\nThese diaries are choppy; Benjamin compares them to studio outtakes. They often read like poetry. Here\u2019s one entry in its entirety, in lines Rilke or Havel or Milosz would envy: Claqueurs in the French theaters: commanders in the orchestra. Ha-ha for the next rows, dropping of newspaper for the men on the gallery Brod\u2019s many elisions, Saul Friedlander wrote in his 2013 biography of Kafka, were responsible for \u201cleading an entire generation of commentators astray.\u201d The issues that most tortured Kafka, except for his writing, tended to be sexual in nature. The passages that express his physical interest in men matter because they help tap into some of the sources of his alienation. Brod cut a line in which Kafka notices a \u201clarge bulge\u201d in another man\u2019s pants on a train, for example. He ended this sentence at its comma: \u201c2 beautiful Swedish boys with long legs, which are so formed and taut that one could really only run one\u2019s tongue along them.\u201d Kafka\u2019s diaries, as is well known, are punishing in their sense of isolation and torment. These traits take on a grainier quality here. Kafka frequently felt, as an artist, \u201cthe imminent possibility of great states that would tear me open and make me capable of anything,\u201d but these states were frustrated, again and again, by his day job, by the confusions of family and female companionship, and by physical frailty compounded by sleeplessness and constipation. He secreted his work slowly, as an oyster does its shell. He was not made for his times \u2014 or for any times, really. Yet more conviviality sneaks into these complete diaries. Kafka spent so many nights at the theater (he admired the way Goethe kept supplies of wine and cold food in his box), and was so opinionated about what he saw, that he might have moonlighted as a theater critic. He befriended members of struggling troupes and developed crushes on some of the actresses. He was perceptive about why even cheap theater so moved him: The sympathy we have for these actors, who are so good and earn nothing and in other ways too get far from enough gratitude and fame, is actually only sympathy over the sad fate of many noble endeavors and above all our own. During his lifetime, Kafka published six slim books but was essentially unknown. He expressed no sense of occasion upon their release; fame seemed to interest him not at all. He did often read his work aloud to friends, laughing as he went along. These diaries are perhaps most interesting for including, as Brod did not, Kafka\u2019s rough drafts and false starts on his stories. You watch his voice develop in something like real time. Kafka witnesses his nephew\u2019s circumcision. He goes sledding. (In photographs, you can see through Kafka to the little boy he used to be.) He weeps at the movies. He contemplates suicide.\n\nHe feasts his eyes on beautiful women, sometimes quite young ones, only to find he\u2019s been caught staring. He reports his dreams; even Kafka cannot make his dreams interesting. Tragedy and forms of comedy don\u2019t just coexist in these diaries but feed each other. He was not, at every moment, unhappy about being unhappy. This review began with Kafka and his nose. It was Gogol, of course, and not Kafka who wrote the absurdist short story \u201cThe Nose,\u201d about a man whose nose leaves his face and takes on a life of its own. It was likely an inspiration for Kafka\u2019s story about the man who becomes a bug. Someday a young scholar will do the hard thinking about Kafka and noses. He was obsessed with them \u2014 he saw them as windows into the soul \u2014 and descriptions of them, and observations about them, are a throughline in these diaries. They were the handles he used to pick up a personality. Circumcisers have red noses and bad breath, he wrote. Does youth end at the tip of the nose, he wondered while staring at a woman on a train, \u201cand does death begin there?\u201dOne man has a thick nose \u201cfrom whose nostrils a strong wind can blow as through horses\u2019 muzzles.\u201d One poor little girl, in his estimation, \u201chas a nose without a future.\u201d Olfaction is among the senses that seem refreshed in this resonant new edition of Kafka\u2019s diaries, which offer the rewards and the challenges of reading his prose. They provide a rich impression of what he called \u201cthe tremendous world I have in my head.\u201d THE DIARIES OF FRANZ KAFKA | Translated by Ross Benjamin | 670 pp. | Schocken Books | $45",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAmtrak said that a CSX freight derailment forced its train from Virginia to Florida to detour from its normal route, adding 20 hours to the trip.\n\nDale Kalkofen, a retired school administrator, boarded an Amtrak train in Northern Virginia at around 5 p.m. on Monday, prepared for a 17-hour trip to Florida with \u201ca little snack bag\u201d of hard-boiled eggs, apples and bananas. But what was supposed to be an overnight journey on the auto train, which was carrying 563 passengers and 350 vehicles, became another pressure-cooker test of traveler endurance in a season of extreme delays and disruptions. Amtrak said that a CSX freight derailment in South Carolina on Monday night forced the auto train to take a detour from its normal route, adding 20 hours to the trip. When the train finally pulled into Sanford, Fla., at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, passengers had been cooped up in their seats or compartments for 37 hours, complaining of stale air, dwindling food supplies, trash piling up in the aisles and a lack of timely information from the crew.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like a train wreck,\u201d Ms. Kalkofen, 76, said in an interview on Wednesday morning after she arrived in Sanford, exhausted but still in time to visit friends and board a Caribbean cruise on Saturday. \u201cI feel like a train wreck.\u201d The delays became so unbearable that some passengers called the police, according to a crew member\u2019s announcement that was captured on video. \u201cOnce again, for those of you that are calling the police, we are not holding you hostage,\u201d the crew member said on the train\u2019s public address system, according to the video, which was shared by ABC News. \u201cWe are giving you all the information which we have. We are sorry about the inconvenience.\u201d Hannah Dore, 21, a University of Maryland student who was traveling with her mother, Linda, said that when she took a walk to the cafe car to stretch her legs around 7 p.m. on Tuesday, she found tempers flaring. At that point, the train had not moved for about four hours, she said. The cafe car was sold out of veggie plates and was down to its last cup of ramen, which some passengers were arguing over in a dispute that Ms. Dore said was \u201calmost barbaric.\u201d She ordered mac and cheese, a Yuengling and a chardonnay.\n\n\u201cEveryone, you can imagine, was super moody and frustrated, and everyone was testy,\u201d Ms. Dore said. \u201cThere were passengers arguing with crew members. It was definitely very tense there.\u201d In an email, an Amtrak spokeswoman said that passengers were given \u201cregular updates, along with meals, snack packs and beverages\u201d throughout the stop-and-start trip. The train also stopped in Savannah, Ga., to refill water and in Jacksonville, Fla., for pizza, the spokeswoman, Kimberly Woods, said. \u201cAmtrak apologizes for the delay,\u201d Ms. Woods said. \u201cWe will be working with each customer on fare refunds.\u201d Mary-Jane Crowley of Glenville, N.Y., who was traveling with her husband, Mike, to their second home in Naples, Fla., said one passenger was worried about running out of diapers for her child and others were worried about running out of medication. \u201cIt was the train ride from hell,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cWhat are you going to do? They will not let you out. You just sit there. You just sit and wait and sit and wait.\u201d Ms. Kalkofen said she overheard passengers complaining about the sorry state of rail travel in the United States and griping that the country was sending too much of its money to \u201cother people.\u201d \u201cA lot of people expressed their frustrations that way, and other people were just nice,\u201d she said. \u201cOne lady was carrying a big cardboard box, collecting trash. The place was quite littered at that point.\u201d",

            "content": "In his Golden Globes monologue, the host Jerrod Carmichael wrestled with his own complicity in legitimizing the awards.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nDid the awards get their legitimacy back? You can\u2019t regain what you never had.\n\nThe big winner of last night\u2019s Golden Globes was the Golden Globes. Please hold your applause. As is sometimes the case with awards, whether or not the victory was merited was beside the point. It was foreordained. The Globes and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts them on, won from the moment that NBC decided to put them back on TV, after taking a year off following the organization\u2019s scandals over racism and corruption. The trophy was a prime-time broadcast replete with film and TV stars serving red-carpet looks. The implicit message was: \u201cAll is forgiven \u2014 now please watch our movies and shows and buy the sponsors\u2019 products!\u201d \u201cThe biggest party in Hollywood is back!\u201d an NBC promo announced. And who wanted to be a party pooper by dwelling on what it was back from?\n\nThat job fell to the host, the comedian Jerrod Carmichael. The decision to return the Globes to TV may have been questionable, but at least it resulted in the best awards-show opening monologue I have ever heard. Really, what Carmichael delivered was less a monologue than a talk, a brief wrestle with the ideas of success and complicity. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m here,\u201d he opened. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m Black.\u201d His performance was like a confessional comedy special condensed into a few minutes. He paced, sat at the edge of the stage and unburdened himself. Here he was, a brilliant Black comic, landing a gig that ratified his undeniable talent but that also conveniently served the H.F.P.A.\u2019s image-laundering purposes. \u201cI won\u2019t say they were a racist organization,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t have a single Black member until George Floyd died, so do with that information what you will.\u201d The crowd laughed sparingly and uncomfortably. I\u2019m not even sure that Carmichael was trying to make them laugh so much as to make them think, and to think things through himself. Should he even be there? On the other hand, why should one group\u2019s failings deny him a career coup (and, in his telling, $500,000)? You could also say that, in so doing, he gave the rest of the room space to enjoy the night and avoid the subject. Once he threw himself on the grenade of controversy, the stars could safely bypass it on the way to the stage.\n\nCertainly, if the rest of Hollywood was having similarly complicated feelings about the Globes, it largely kept them to itself amid all the thank yous to the H.F.P.A. There was the occasional reference to the recent troubles. On the red carpet, Sheryl Lee Ralph of \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d talked about getting her first Globe nomination in \u201ca year when the Hollywood Foreign Press would open up its hearts and its minds to an understanding that diversity actually works.\u201d A few celebs were conspicuous by their absence. Brendan Fraser, the star of \u201cThe Whale,\u201d had announced that he would boycott because of the H.F.P.A.\u2019s handling of his charge that a former leader of the group groped him in 2003. Tom Cruise returned his three Globe trophies in 2021, a gesture that Carmichael joked about onstage. In her awards remarks, the H.F.P.A.\u2019s president, Helen Hoehne, spoke vaguely of \u201ca year of momentous change for our organization\u201d and pledged to \u201ccontinue to add representation to our organization from around the world.\u201d But while the H.F.P.A. wants to brand itself as owning the failures of its past, those went mostly undetailed in the broadcast.\n\nThe 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation that found that the H.F.P.A. had no Black members also detailed reports of unethical influence and of members snorkeling up freebies, like an extravagant junket to the French shooting location of \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d before that show\u2019s baffling nomination. Hollywood responded indignantly \u2014 finally \u2014 and NBC skipped last year\u2019s show. That was a year ago. Last fall, NBC cited the H.F.P.A.\u2019s \u201ccommitment to ongoing change.\u201d (The group added Black members and said that it had made changes to its ethics practices; there were, notably, a healthy amount of nominees and winners of color on Tuesday night.) It agreed to bring back the cameras, without which the Globes might as well not exist. The Globes began as an industry event in 1944, a gambit to increase the small journalistic group\u2019s pull. Their arrival on national TV in the 1960s made them a flea under a magnifying glass. They were what the historian Daniel Boorstin described in \u201cThe Image\u201d as a \u201cpseudo-event,\u201d a manufactured happening given the appearance of importance by media coverage. Nearly everybody got something for playing along. TV got a lucrative special; audiences got a breezy, often wild show; the entertainment media got headlines and clicks; stars and studios got a promotional platform; and the H.F.P.A. got legitimacy. (My hands are not clean either. I have spent years as a TV critic pretending to care about the Golden Globes because I wrote for publications that wanted coverage of the Golden Globes.) But because everyone acknowledged that the Globes were frothy and frivolous, for a long time the mutually agreed-on charade seemed innocuous enough. Over time the jokes \u2014 that the awards were a boozy goof put on by a tiny, sketchy organization \u2014 made it from insider snark to podium monologue.\n\nIn 2011, the host Ricky Gervais japed that H.F.P.A. members didn\u2019t nominate \u201cThe Tourist\u201d just to hang out with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, \u201cThey also accepted bribes.\u201d In 2020, a year before the revelation that the H.F.P.A. had no Black members, he explained that the dearth of nominees of color was because the association \u201cis just very, very racist.\u201d The Globes were inoculated by irony. If they were merely a harmless joke, maybe everyone could look past it and enjoy the passionate and zany speeches. But the awards had become too big to be harmless. They generated millions of dollars in advertising. They had a big promotional effect and influence on the rest of awards season, which meant big money for studios and careers made (or not) on the capricious decisions of a suspect group. Where there are actual stakes, there can be actual loss and actual harm. Those stakes, however, appear also to have made the Golden Globes too big to fail. The latest scandals should have been the end of them, at least as a major media event. (Talent should be recognized, but no one is entitled to get an award on national TV.) NBC could yet put an end to all of this by cutting off the attention spigot \u2014 it has the Globes on a one-year contract \u2014 though it\u2019s just as likely that falling ratings could finish off the awards some year as any ethical lapses. In the meantime, the twisted irony is that the Globes\u2019 scandals could leave them seeming more weighty, more august, more important than they did before. After all, the premise of much of this year\u2019s coverage \u2014 did the Globes rehabilitate themselves? \u2014 implies that they had credibility to lose in the first place. Here too Carmichael may have had the best word: \u201cI took this job assuming they hadn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d For now, at least, the Golden Globes are back, too big to fail, but perhaps not too big to fail upward.",

He was part of the ambitious cohort of policymakers who gathered around the White House in the early 1960s.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAmong the last of the Kennedy era\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest,\u201d he later transformed the Carnegie Endowment into a leading think tank.\n\nThomas Hughes, who as a State Department official and member of the Kennedy-era brain trust stood out for his deep skepticism over the Vietnam War, and who later transformed the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace into a training base for America\u2019s foreign policy leadership, died on Jan. 2 in Washington. He was 97. The death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his wife, Jane Casey Hughes. Mr. Hughes was among the last survivors of the ambitious group of policymakers who gathered around the White House in the early 1960s, sometimes called the \u201cbest and brightest.\u201d He certainly fit the part: Rhodes scholarship, Yale Law School and a rapid climb through the Washington ranks. But he also stood in stark contrast to the McGeorge Bundys, Walt Rostows and other foreign-policy mandarins within the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He came not from the East Coast establishment but from Midwestern stock, and his earliest political allegiances were to the progressive liberalism of Senator (and later Vice President) Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. After working as Humphrey\u2019s legislative counsel in the 1950s, Mr. Hughes spent most of the 1960s as the director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, or INR, which provided information and analysis to the rest of the State Department. The job provided him a front-row seat to a host of foreign policy crises, including in Berlin and Cuba. But it was the slow boil in Southeast Asia that worried him the most.\n\nWhile many in his cohort thought the United States had both the obligation and capacity to shape the conflict between North and South Vietnam, Mr. Hughes and his bureau were pessimistic. They pointed out that the South Vietnamese leadership was weak and unpopular, while the North was stronger and more determined than expected. Things came to a boil in February 1965. President Lyndon B. Johnson was considering a major bombing campaign, called Rolling Thunder, against the North Vietnamese. Robert S. McNamara, the secretary of defense, and Mr. Bundy, the national security adviser, were pushing for it to begin immediately. Mr. Hughes, full of doubt, called Humphrey, who was newly installed as vice president. Humphrey was in Georgia on a hunting trip with a friend. The vice president, no fan of intervention in Vietnam, had Mr. Hughes fly down to see him. They devised a set of arguments, which Mr. Hughes wrote up in a memo. He pointed out both the unlikelihood of defeating the North and the high political costs that the Democrats would pay for trying. He recommended withdrawal.\n\nIt was among the most prescient documents produced during the war \u2014 practically every prediction Mr. Hughes made came tragically to pass. \u201cI have my students read this memo,\u201d Fredrik Logevall, a historian at Harvard and the author of \u201cEmbers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America\u2019s Vietnam\u201d (2012), said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing document.\u201d Humphrey had the memo retyped on his letterhead and delivered to Johnson. It did not go over well. Johnson did not want to hear dissent, and he froze Humphrey out of discussions about Vietnam for more than a year. In that time, Rolling Thunder began, and U.S. troops started flowing into South Vietnam. Mr. Hughes survived Johnson\u2019s wrath unscathed, and continued to direct INR through the end of the administration and into the Nixon White House. After about a year in London, as the deputy ambassador to Britain, he returned home to become the president of the Carnegie Endowment. Carnegie was a linchpin in the country\u2019s foreign policy establishment, but as Mr. Hughes knew better than most, the establishment was beginning to crack. Over the next 20 years, he remade it as a catalyst for new directions in foreign policy. He closed the endowment\u2019s offices in New York and Geneva to focus its efforts on Washington. He created programs to diversify the Foreign Service. He assumed control of a new magazine, Foreign Policy, and filled it with articles by young writers eager to debate the post-Vietnam future.\n\nThomas Lowe Hughes was born on Dec. 11, 1925, in Mankato, Minn., about 60 miles south of Minneapolis. His father, Evan Hughes, was a lawyer, and his mother, Alice (Lowe) Hughes, was a homemaker and university librarian. His small-town childhood, he recalled, was both an idyll and a cloistered world he was eager to escape. In high school, he was the second national president of the Student Federalists, a movement promoting world government \u2014 his predecessor was Harris Wofford, a future friend and senator from Pennsylvania. The position took Thomas around the country as a speaker and advocate. He lunched with Vice President Henry Wallace in Washington and attended the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. Back home, he met many of the ambitious young men who were turning Minnesota into a political powerhouse, including Humphrey, Gov. Harold Stassen, the future Minnesota governor Orville L. Freeman and the future vice president Walter F. Mondale. He also developed an abiding love for Germany. The Hughes\u2019s were related to German royalty, and when Thomas was 13, he traded letters with the deposed Kaiser Wilhelm II, as part of his research for a book about that side of his family.\n\nIn 1947, Mr. Hughes graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota with a degree in government relations. He then traveled to Oxford University, where he spent the next two years as a Rhodes scholar. He remained politically active: Among other endeavors, he went on the BBC in 1948 to defend President Harry S. Truman, and, that same year, he spent six weeks in Italy working for liberal political campaigns in an election that threatened to see Communists take power. After returning to the United States and graduating from Yale Law School in 1952, Mr. Hughes spent two years in the Air Force as a lawyer. He married Jean Reiman in 1955; she died in 1993. Along with his second wife, whom he married in 1995, he is survived by his sons, Thomas and Allan, and his sister, Marianne Hughes Nordholm. Mr. Hughes spent the rest of the 1950s toggling between top jobs with Humphrey and Chester Bowles, who had been governor of Connecticut and, in 1958, won election to Congress. Bowles, who had also served as ambassador to India, was a close adviser to John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 presidential campaign, and when he became deputy secretary of state in 1961, he brought Mr. Hughes with him. He was popular enough among the Washington establishment that, in 1969, the incoming secretary of state, William P. Rogers, insisted that he remain in place at INR. Over the objections of President Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Rogers then promoted Mr. Hughes to be second-in-command at the American embassy in London. He left government in 1970 and never returned, despite occasional entreaties \u2014 President Jimmy Carter twice asked him to run the C.I.A. Though he was as well connected as anyone on the Georgetown cocktail-party circuit, he preferred to remain behind the scenes. \u201cThose who talk about power are those who lack it themselves,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1981. \u201cPower corrupts, and lack of power corrupts absolutely.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFederal prosecutors could decide soon whether to indict the president\u2019s son on tax and gun charges, and he faces a fresh round of hostile congressional hearings. But a close look at his story shows that it differs in important ways from the narrative promoted by Republicans.\n\nThe way Republicans tell it, President Biden has been complicit in a long-running scheme to profit from his position in public life through shady dealings around the world engineered by his son, Hunter Biden. Taking a first step in their long-promised investigation, Republicans on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday demanded information about the Bidens\u2019 banking transactions from the Treasury Department. And in an earlier report on the Bidens intended to lay the groundwork for hearings they plan to hold, they said they had evidence \u201cdemonstrating deliberate, repeated deception of the American people, abuse of the executive branch for personal gain, use of government power to obstruct the investigation\u201d and more. The real Hunter Biden story is complex and very different in important ways from the narrative promoted by Republicans \u2014 but troubling in its own way. After his father became vice president, Hunter Biden, a 52-year-old Yale-educated lawyer, forged business relationships with foreign interests that brought him millions of dollars, raised questions about whether he was cashing in on his family name, set off alarms among government officials about potential conflicts of interest, and provided Republicans an opening for years of attacks on his father.\n\nInvestigators have similarly sought information about interactions between Hunter Biden\u2019s business associates and his father. But Mr. Weiss, people familiar with the investigation say, appears to be focused on a less politically explosive set of possible charges stemming from his failure to meet filing deadlines for his 2016 and 2017 tax returns, and questions about whether he falsely claimed at least $30,000 in deductions for business expenses. Mr. Weiss is also said to be considering charging Hunter Biden, who has openly acknowledged his years of struggle with drugs and alcohol, with lying on a U.S. government form that he filled out to purchase a handgun in 2018. On the form, he answered that he was not using drugs \u2014 an assertion that prosecutors might be able to challenge based on his erratic behavior and possible witness accounts of his drug use around that period. A veteran federal prosecutor, Mr. Weiss was nominated in 2017 as U.S. attorney by President Donald J. Trump. He was kept on by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland after President Biden took office to avoid any suggestion of political meddling in the investigation. Mr. Weiss has been given the authority by the Justice Department over whether to bring charges and could make a decision at any time. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers have argued to prosecutors that the potential charges are considered so narrow by the department that even if prosecutors believe they can prove them, they are almost always dealt with through civil actions without bringing criminal charges. Regardless of what the department decides, Republicans who now control the House intend to intensify their scrutiny of Hunter Biden in a bid to inflict damage on his father as he prepares for his likely 2024 re-election bid.\n\nDespite their years of efforts \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to muscle Ukraine into helping him sully the Bidens, an escapade that led to his first impeachment \u2014 Republicans have yet to demonstrate that the senior Mr. Biden was involved in his son\u2019s business deals or took any action to benefit him or his foreign partners. And some of what Republicans have cast as evidence that could implicate President Biden in questionable behavior by his son \u2014 assertions that father and son shared bank accounts, for example, or that the elder Mr. Biden was a partner with his son in his stillborn deal with the Chinese tycoon \u2014 is contradicted or undercut by a fuller look at Hunter Biden\u2019s activities. An examination by The New York Times of Mr. Weiss\u2019s investigation and Hunter Biden\u2019s journey to this juncture does not provide either side with the narrative they would prefer. It highlights how he aligned himself with foreign actors eager to leverage their connections to him to further their own interests. But it also underscores how far removed the most likely legal charges against him are from the issues most aggressively promoted by Republicans \u2014 and how his father\u2019s opponents have often twisted or exaggerated the story of his descent to score political points. This account is based on interviews with his former business partners, family members and close friends, as well as officials and lawyers familiar with the Justice Department investigation. It also builds on previous reporting by The Times and other news organizations, and draws from a selection of Hunter Biden\u2019s leaked emails that The Times has verified as authentic, out of thousands attributed to him that were disseminated by allies of Mr. Trump ahead of the 2020 election to try to undercut the Biden campaign.\n\nThat same month, the Senate confirmed Mr. Weiss\u2019s nomination by Mr. Trump as the U.S. attorney in Delaware. He was ultimately given responsibility for overseeing the various investigations touching on Hunter Biden. After his father entered the presidential race in 2019, and with his relationship with Burisma under renewed scrutiny and political attack, Hunter gave up his seat on the company\u2019s board, cutting off his main source of income. That May, he married Melissa Cohen, his second wife, and he rededicated himself to staying sober. A few months later, Hunter and Melissa made plans to honeymoon on Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast. But when he went to check in for their flight, he was told his passport had expired. He rushed to a passport renewal agency, where he learned firsthand what his accountant had warned him about the previous year: The State Department would not give him a new passport because of the outstanding tax liens. The couple honeymooned in Hawaii, and Hunter Biden tried in vain to get in touch with his accountant, Mr. Morgan. But Mr. Morgan had passed away. Hunter hired new accountants, who reminded him that he had never filed his 2016 and 2017 returns. (The 2016 returns that had been prepared for him would later turn up in a box he stored in Hallie Biden\u2019s house.) The accountants estimated that he owed about $2 million in back taxes, plus accumulated interest and penalties. He did not have that much, so he filed the returns without paying the bill, and his accountants reached out to the I.R.S. to discuss a payment plan.",

            "content": "\u201cIf you want to live here,\u201d a chapter president of the Montana Federation of Republican Women said, \u201cbe a Christian.\u201d Credit...Ashley Gilbertson/VII, for The New York Times\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. The fifth season of the hit show \u201cYellowstone\u201d premiered on the Sunday after the midterm elections, with Kevin Costner\u2019s character, the rancher John Dutton, assuming Montana\u2019s governorship. \u201cThis was never my plan,\u201d he says, wearing a cowboy hat outside the State Capitol building in Helena. Dutton has reluctantly entered politics in part to stop an influx of rich outsiders he believes are transforming his home. In the last three years, Montana has become the second-fastest-growing state in the nation, largely because of the arrival of wealthy transplants. Unlike Dutton, many influential figures in the state\u2019s real Republican Party have welcomed them, sometimes calling them \u201cpolitical refugees\u201d fleeing blue states. Montana\u2019s actual governor, the Republican Greg Gianforte, is himself a multimillionaire who was raised in Pennsylvania. Since assuming office in 2021, Gianforte has presided over this period of demographic change and economic growth, which has coincided with a hard shift to the right in state politics. Montana has a tradition of ticket-splitting and has long been one of the most politically independent states in the union, resisting the kind of single-party rule that has flourished in the neighboring states of Idaho and Wyoming. But in recent years, Republicans have managed to secure an ironclad grasp over state government, and the religious right is ascendant. \u201cWe\u2019re a country founded on Christian ideals,\u201d Austin Knudsen, the attorney general, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s made us the country that we are.\u201d In 2021, the Montana Legislature passed a bill banning transgender athletes on sports teams at public schools and universities, an increased tax credit benefiting private Christian schools and numerous anti-abortion laws. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to convert the state,\u201d said Whitney Williams, who ran for governor as a Democrat in 2020. When the state G.O.P. gathered in Billings last July to formalize its platform, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, told those assembled that Montana was \u201ca symbol for the nation.\u201d The Montana Republican Party has a few factions, among them free-market advocates and moderates willing to cross party lines. But the dominant voice is that of the far right. At the convention in Billings, that group was well represented. In attendance was the party treasurer, Derek Skees, who has called Montana\u2019s Constitution a \u201csocialist rag\u201d; a state representative named John Fuller, who published an opinion column in The Flathead Beacon earlier that year declaring that democracy had \u201cfailed as miserably as socialism\u201d; and a public-service commissioner, Randy Pinocci, who told me that he \u201chunt[s] RINOs\u201d (Republicans in name only). During the convention, a group of delegates led an ultimately unsuccessful push to declare the 2020 presidential election fraudulent. (In Montana, such efforts occupy a curious logical space: Citizen groups sympathetic to Donald Trump have repeatedly demanded recounts of districts he won handily.)\n\nGianforte, a bald, resolute man of 61, made only a brief appearance in Billings. He is an evangelical Christian and former entrepreneur who sold his cloud-based customer-service company, RightNow Technologies, to Oracle for $1.5 billion in 2012, before entering politics. For more than 25 years, Gianforte has belonged to a church in Bozeman adhering to a literal interpretation of the Bible that rejects evolution and considers homosexuality a sin. He doesn\u2019t often discuss his faith, but his donations reflect a clear set of religious values. Through their foundation, Gianforte and his wife, Susan, have contributed to an organization that funds scholarships at private schools, many of which are Christian; a Montana fossil museum that challenges evolution; and Focus on the Family, a Christian organization that vehemently opposes gay rights. From 2013 to 2019, the Gianforte Family Charitable Trust gave $300,000 to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a global nonprofit dedicated to protecting religious liberty; its lawyers have represented several Christian business owners who refused to serve same-sex couples. (Through a spokesperson, Gianforte declined interview requests.) Gianforte spent much of his remarks in Billings congratulating the convention delegates on their party\u2019s takeover of Montana politics. \u201cWe have reversed a 100-year trend,\u201d he told the crowd, noting that it was the first time since the 1920s that Republicans controlled all state constitutional offices and a majority of the Legislature. And Gianforte said he believed the best days for Montana Republicans were still ahead. \u201cI think we can paint our state an even brighter shade of red,\u201d he said. The recent midterms may have proved him right. In November, Montana defied the national trend of Republican disappointment. Because of its increased population, the state earned a second congressional seat, which went to Ryan Zinke, who previously served as a U.S. representative before becoming Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior, a post from which he resigned while being investigated for using his office for personal gain. (He has rejected the allegations as \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d) Republicans won a supermajority of seats in the State Legislature, which means the party has enough votes to put proposed amendments to the State Constitution on the ballot. Duane Ankney, a 76-year-old outgoing Republican state senator, told me last summer that he worried legislators might advance what he called \u201chate bills\u201d targeting the individual liberties of Montanans. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s become so extreme.\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d For much of the 20th century, Montana reliably sent both Democrats and Republicans to Washington. Candidates across the political spectrum respected Montanans\u2019 libertarian streak, which was born out of a deep suspicion of corporate power. Montana politics were defined by the period in the early 20th century when mining barons ruled the state, controlling legislators and the local newspapers. In response to the corruption of these \u201ccopper kings,\u201d Montana passed a strict campaign-finance law in 1912; it also nurtured a powerful organized labor movement. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat who served as governor from 2005 to 2013, has said that the state\u2019s motto should be: \u201cNone of your damn business.\u201d\n\nIn 1972, Montanans approved a new State Constitution, updating the one that was ratified at statehood in 1889. Concerns about industrial pollution were peaking in the 1970s, and the new Constitution guaranteed citizens the right to \u201ca clean and healthful environment,\u201d as well as an individual right to privacy that the state Supreme Court later decided, in a 1999 ruling, protected access to abortion. Though the new Constitution created mechanisms to dissuade partisanship, including an independent commission tasked with redrawing electoral maps every decade, Montana continued to foster strains of right-wing extremism, providing refuge to white nationalists and militias. Montana has the smallest percentage of Black residents in the country, and the largest minority group in the state, Native Americans, have faced entrenched disenfranchisement since securing the right to vote in 1924. The settlement of a 2012 lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act mandated the establishment of polling places on particular reservations, but it remains common for tribal citizens to have to drive vast distances to vote in statewide and national races. In recent years, the rise of Montana\u2019s Christian right has been enabled by the weakening of the state Democratic Party. It has become harder for Montana Democrats to separate themselves from the national party and, as a result, ticket-splitting has dropped. As the strength of timber and railroad unions has faded across much of the state, the state Democratic Party has refocused its organizing efforts on expanding cities and the growing Indigenous vote. But Ta\u2019jin Perez, who is Totonac Indigenous and the deputy executive director of the organizing group Western Native Voice, told me that those efforts have been sporadic. \u201cBoth parties have a really lackluster track record in sustained connection and relationship-building in Indian Country,\u201d he said. Changes to campaign-finance laws have also contributed to tipping the balance of power in the state. Following the 2010 Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case, a dark-money group that became known as American Tradition Partnership challenged Montana\u2019s 1912 law that prohibited corporate spending on campaigns. In 2011, the Montana Supreme Court upheld the law, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling the following year, and corporate money poured into Montana. State law still restricts direct corporate spending on local elections, but political-action committees and dark-money groups have injected money into divisive contests and, as in much of the country, there\u2019s no limit on candidates\u2019 donations to their own campaigns.\n\nGianforte first ran for governor in 2016 against the incumbent Democrat, Steve Bullock, spending more than $6 million of his own money on the race. Gianforte, who was taken with Montana\u2019s land and iconography, is a big-game hunter and the author of a 2005 book, \u201cBootstrapping Your Business,\u201d that features cowboy boots on its cover. But he couldn\u2019t shake the perception of himself as a wealthy outsider. During his 2016 race for governor, Democratic attacks focused on the fact that, seven years earlier, Gianforte filed a complaint to remove an easement accessing a river running through his property \u2014 a serious political misstep in a state in which all navigable streams are public and equal access to wilderness is sacrosanct. Gianforte claimed there had been a misunderstanding with his title company and didn\u2019t pursue his complaint, but Bullock won re-election handily. Gianforte\u2019s was a rare loss for Montana Republicans that cycle, as Trump blasted apart politics in rural America. Not only did Trump win the state by 20 points, but he also seemed to obliterate Montanans\u2019 resistance to single-party rule. Four months after the election, when Zinke was confirmed as interior secretary, Gianforte ran for his newly vacant seat in the House of Representatives. His campaign benefited from millions of dollars spent on attack ads targeting his opponent, and he began to align himself more with Trump. At an event hosted by a Christian political organization, he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Less than a month later, on the eve of his election victory, Gianforte assaulted Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, who was asking him a question about the congressional Republican health care plan. A Gianforte spokesman claimed that Jacobs had initiated the physical contact by grabbing Gianforte\u2019s wrist, but Fox News journalists who were present refuted that account. Gianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger-management classes. He also donated to the Committee to Protect Journalists, but not before winning his race by six points. At a 2018 rally, Trump said he thought the attack had helped Gianforte at the polls, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s my guy.\u201d\n\nGianforte\u2019s first months in office were occupied by Covid-related battles. News agencies circulated a photo of the governor receiving a vaccine, but he resisted closing any public institutions, leaving decisions about whether schools would remain open to individual districts. The state Department of Health and Human Services also issued an emergency order instructing schools to consider parents\u2019 wishes about mask mandates, claiming that \u201cthe scientific literature is not conclusive\u201d on their efficacy. In response, the Montana Nurses Association accused the state of pushing \u201cjunk science.\u201d Infighting at school-board meetings became commonplace. In Montana, as in much of the country, the arguments centered on masks and the teaching of what critics called \u201ccritical race theory.\u201d Knudsen, the attorney general, issued an opinion that described certain antiracist programming as \u201cracial harassment,\u201d and Gianforte would later oppose the addition of the word \u201cequity\u201d to a teachers\u2019 code of ethics. During the 2021 legislative session, Republicans introduced a conservative wish list of bills. Along with the ban on transgender athletes, which has been blocked by the courts, they passed a bill that abolished an independent judicial-nomination commission, allowing the governor to directly appoint judges to vacant positions. Another bill increased the tax-credit limit for a private scholarship fund for K-12 schools from $150 to $2 million by 2023 \u2014 a boon to faith-based institutions. A majority of private schools in the state are Christian, and in 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a restriction on Montana religious schools\u2019 receiving funding from such tax-credit programs. (The Alliance Defending Freedom, the religious-liberty nonprofit that the Gianfortes have supported, filed an amicus brief in support of the victorious plaintiffs.) There were also bills banning same-day voter registration and paid ballot collection \u2014 measures that are considered essential for tribal communities because of the great distances between many reservations and polling places. After Gianforte signed the voting restrictions into law, Keaton Sunchild, a member of the Rocky Boy\u2019s Chippewa-Cree Tribe and at the time the political director for Western Native Voice, called the laws \u201ca coordinated, pretty overt way of trying to tamp down the enthusiasm and power of the Native vote.\u201d Western Native Voice, along with other advocacy groups, filed suit, and a judge has since blocked the laws as unconstitutional. Judges may have slowed the Legislature\u2019s momentum, but Henry Kriegel, an influential lobbyist with Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers group, told me that 2021 was the group\u2019s most successful session in Montana in a decade, citing several bills that restricted government regulation. Gianforte often frames his agenda in similar terms. \u201cGovernment doesn\u2019t create opportunity,\u201d he told the delegates in Billings. \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of the way.\u201d In the months before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Gianforte signed several laws restricting reproductive rights, including a bill requiring health care providers to offer women the opportunity to view an ultrasound before deciding to terminate a pregnancy. Groups including Planned Parenthood brought suit, and a Montana district court judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the laws as unconstitutional. But Knudsen, the attorney general, began a counteroffensive, asking the state Supreme Court to overrule the judge \u2014 and to reconsider the 1999 case that linked abortion to the State Constitution\u2019s right to privacy. (The court declined to lift the injunction and has not signaled that it would reconsider its 1999 decision.) \u201cWe\u2019ve got a real judge problem in this state,\u201d Knudsen, who frequently complains about \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d said at a firearm-advocacy event last May. Marc Racicot, the former Montana governor and attorney general who was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2002 and 2003, has criticized Knudsen\u2019s attacks on the judiciary as dangerous for the rule of law.\n\nAs the Montana Republican Party has strengthened its hold on power, the coalition\u2019s existing fissures have widened. Over the course of the three-day platform convention in Billings this summer, numerous speakers appeared to be trying to outdo one another in their performative anger, and it was apparent that the enemies were not limited to the left. Even Skees, the provocative party treasurer, seemed to be watching his right flank. At the time of the convention, he was awaiting the results of a recount of a tight primary race for a seat on the public-service commission, which regulates utilities. \u201cDerek Skees was always a hard-right guy,\u201d said one state Republican official, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. \u201cBut now he\u2019s being called a RINO!\u201d The Republicans unveiled their official party platform on the last day of the convention. The fieriest debate surrounded the abortion plank, which contained no exceptions for incest or rape. \u201cWe support the preservation of innocent human life at every stage of life, in all circumstances, beginning at conception through natural death,\u201d it read. A young proxy delegate suggested removing the phrase \u201cbeginning at conception.\u201d She was met with boos; Skees shouted the idea down. (Shortly after the convention, Skees conceded his primary to his even more conservative opponent.) In conversations during the convention, several Republicans were open about their embrace of Christian nationalist ideology. Steven Galloway, a state representative from Great Falls, told me that he and his wife, who is also a legislator, had taken what are called \u201cbiblical citizenship classes,\u201d developed by a former Texas legislator, who argues that the founding fathers drew heavily from the Bible when writing the Constitution and that the strict separation of church and state is a revisionist idea. \u201cIf you want to live here,\u201d Karla Johnson, a chapter president of the Montana Federation of Republican Women, said, \u201cbe a Christian.\u201d Keith Regier, an influential state senator, said all laws should be based on Judeo-Christian principles. \u201cThe Ten Commandments were a good foundation for any country to live by,\u201d he told me. He was upset by what he perceived to be a censorious cultural moment \u2014 especially when it came to people speaking out against gay and transgender rights. \u201cThere is an open war on Christianity in this country.\u201d I told him that I\u2019d heard other Montanans voice feelings of persecution because of the imposition of Christian doctrine. Was there a middle ground to be found? \u201cThere probably isn\u2019t a middle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have both.\u201d Gianforte avoids such extreme language, sticking to economic messaging; while he might enable religious policy, a number of Democratic and Republican legislators said that he does not openly push it. But Alan Rassaby, the former general counsel of Gianforte\u2019s company, RightNow Technologies, told me that he thought Gianforte would gladly take down the wall between church and state if he had the opportunity. \u201cHe\u2019d see that as part of his reshaped destiny,\u201d Rassaby said. \u201cBut at the same time, he\u2019s pragmatic. So what can he get away with? Whatever he can get away with, he\u2019ll get away with in shaping a Christian society. Because he believes that\u2019s a true society.\u201d\n\nI spoke with several veterans of Montana politics who found this optimistic framing baffling. Bill Lombardi, a longtime Democratic operative, said the party was \u201cinstitutionalizing losing.\u201d Jon Tester, the Democratic U.S. senator, said that candidates need to campaign harder: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of getting out and meeting people where they\u2019re at.\u201d For some, a larger, existential question loomed: whether Montana itself had undergone a spiritual transformation. Schweitzer, the former governor, was one of those longtime party stalwarts who thought the pendulum would swing back toward moderation. \u201cMontanans are still the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Montana Democratic Party took the year off.\u201d But Jason Small, a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and a moderate Republican state senator, told me he sensed a more fundamental shift. \u201cOne of the Montana values is, if you\u2019re neighbor\u2019s not hurting you, you leave them alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, what I see is less of that and more of, \u2018You\u2019re just going to do it my way.\u2019\u201d Abe Streep is the author of \u201cBrothers on Three: A True Story of Family, Resistance and Hope on a Reservation in Montana.\u201d Ashley Gilbertson is an Australian photographer and writer living in New York. His photograph from the Jan. 6 attack was part of the Times entry that was a finalist in the breaking-news-reporting category of the Pulitzer Prizes in 2022.",

            "content": "Uliana Kychenko, a freelance marketing manager, works from a table in a co-working space set up in Epicentr, a department store in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nSporadic power outages have people resorting to makeshift office spaces in the Ukrainian capital. Stores have set up power hubs, and workers are getting comfortable doing their jobs in home furnishing displays.\n\nCome On In, the Internet Is Fine: Kyiv Workers Get Online in Unlikely Spots\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Artem Kudria lounged on a blue beanbag chair, his laptop plugged in, hoodie up and his feet \u2014 clad in orange socks \u2014 stretched out in front of him. He was hard at work as a designer for a technology company. But this wasn\u2019t his living room or even an office lounge space. Instead, he was working in the furniture showroom of a department store, not far from a colorful children\u2019s bedroom display and a model kitchen that in another time and place might have been found at Ikea. With power outages an all too familiar burden of everyday life in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the store, called Epicentr, has opened a large free space for people to set up and work. \u201cI have no power in my office, there was no light there this morning, that\u2019s why I came here,\u201d explained Mr. Kudria, 28. He added, \u201cWhen people are facing challenges which are trying to destroy their lives, the healthy response is to resist, to be defiant.\u201d\n\nAround him, dozens of workers had taken up similar positions on the sprawling third floor in an area once packed with a selection of tiling, kitchen sinks and living room furniture. As cities and towns across Ukraine grapple with outages, the result of Russian airstrikes targeting critical infrastructure, workers across all sectors have had to adapt quickly. And thanks to innovation, creativity and the generosity of businesses, they are finding a way to continue with one of the fundamental aspects of society \u2014 work, even if it is sometimes interrupted by air-raid alerts.\n\nGrocery stores have set up couches and extension cords for those dealing with power outages and are also advertising their parking lots as a free working space where people can get online in their cars. Open laptops are a common sight in Kyiv\u2019s metro stations, where people can get online and continue to work remotely while sheltering for hours amid the risk of airstrikes. The free working hubs in places like Epicentr are comfortable and warm. The store has a small coffee machine, free internet and ample power outlets. On a recent day extension cords snaked across the floor.\n\nMany of the outages in Kyiv can be anticipated \u2014 the local government has issued a schedule of when the power will be shut down in different areas to conserve energy. But airstrikes mean there are still unpredictable blackouts. Iryna Bezverkha, who works as a consultant, rushed over to Epicentr on Tuesday afternoon when the power suddenly went out in her home. \u201cWhen they are planned or scheduled outages, I try to adapt,\u201d said Ms. Bezverkha, 49, who tried to adjust her schedule around the blackout. \u201cBut when I have a call scheduled and I have an emergency outage, I come here.\u201d To one side of her, a wedding photographer was editing photos; an accountant sat on the other side. \u201cIt is a defiance,\u201d she said, to the uncertainty of life in a country at war. \u201cYou keep things going and keep doing what you are doing in your routine life. We just have to adapt.\u201d In a central Kyiv subway station during Tuesday morning\u2019s rush hour, commuters crowded platforms and brushed past each other as they hustled to connecting trains, an indication of just how many people were headed to work. \u201cRight now I\u2019m actually going from one office to the other,\u201d said Olha Dorofeyeva, as she rushed toward an arriving train.\n\nAs she put it: \u201cWe all have certain duties, and each one of us has his or her own battlefront.\u201d Many people in Kyiv said their determination to keep working stemmed from a commitment to help keep Ukrainian society functioning, as much as the practical need to provide for their families. Serhii Titenko, 34, who works as a quality assurance engineer testing software for an IT company, described how his office has become more resistant to the outages. \u201cWe have a little \u2018invincibility point\u2019 in our office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s warm and we\u2019ve got power.\u201d He said his company purchased generators and a Starlink terminal, which offers online connection via orbiting satellites, bypassing conventional providers. \u201cAll are trying to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need power, you\u2019d buy a generator or use alternatives, like car batteries at home. Long story short, none of my friends left, everyone is trying to stay here, be useful and work.\u201d The Ukrainian government has made it a priority to keep the country\u2019s internet services functioning, searching for ways to ensure that mobile providers have enough energy to power their operations even when the grid fails. In an interview, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian minister for digital transformation, said that the number of people accessing the internet using mobile data in Kyiv during the second week of this month was comparable to the same week one year earlier, before the Russian invasion. Many small businesses, stores and restaurants now have generators, which has made working in those industries, which cannot be done remotely, less difficult.\n\nAnna Polivoda, 32, works in Salon Special in central Kyiv and has spent the last several weeks working as the business owners have made it more resilient to power outages. When the regular blackouts first began in the autumn, she had to shift all of her scheduled haircuts to daytime hours, though she sometimes had a colleague holding up flashlight if it got too dark. Unable to plug in the blow-dryers, Ms. Polivoda had to send clients home with wet hair. But that didn\u2019t stop them from coming. \u201cPeople just got to used to these difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one was angry, everyone understood.\u201d Then, late last month, the salon owners bought a generator that allows them to keep the lights on and use the blow-dryers. They bought a larger boiler to ensure a surplus of hot water. For now, Ms. Polivoda\u2019s clients keep booking haircuts and other beauty services. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of resistance, in some ways, for normal people to be doing normal things, like getting their hair done, their nails done, going to get coffee, the cinema, the theater,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really stands in opposition to the war.\u201d",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "If last week\u2019s 15 rounds of balloting for House speaker proved anything, it\u2019s that Democrats like their congressional leaders a lot more than Republicans do. While Democrats again and again voted unanimously for Hakeem Jeffries, Kevin McCarthy endured insult after insult from his side of the aisle. Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, mocked Mr. McCarthy for having \u201csold shares of himself\u201d to win the speaker\u2019s job. Tucker Carlson said Mr. McCarthy\u2019s \u201creal constituency is the lobbying community in Washington.\u201d A poll last month by Monmouth University found that Mr. McCarthy had a net approval rating of only 9 percent among Republicans. By contrast, his predecessor Nancy Pelosi had a net approval rating of 59 percent among Democrats. It\u2019s not just Mr. McCarthy. According to that same poll, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has a net approval rating of negative 23 percent among his fellow Republicans, while the majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has a net rating of positive 33 among his fellow Democrats. The Republican disdain for the people who lead them on Capitol Hill is nothing new: At the 2016 Republican National Convention, Mr. McConnell was booed. When John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, left the speakership in 2015, his approval rating was underwater in his party, too. Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader once considered the leading candidate to replace Mr. Boehner, was defeated for re-election in 2014 by a right-wing insurgent who spent only about $200,000 on his campaign. Why are Republicans so much more dissatisfied than Democrats with their congressional leaders? It\u2019s not as if those leaders have been markedly less effective. Sure, Democrats have passed big spending and environmental bills during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. But while Donald Trump was president, congressional Republicans enacted a huge tax cut. They also engineered a transformation of the Supreme Court that is likely to tilt federal policy to the right for decades. No one can credibly claim that Mr. McConnell is a lousy legislative strategist.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Republicans don\u2019t win legislative victories. It\u2019s that legislative victories can\u2019t answer the party\u2019s underlying discontent, which is less about government policy than about American culture. Democrats worry about voting rights, gun control, climate change and abortion \u2014 enormous challenges, but ones that congressional leaders can at least try to address. What Republicans fear, above all, is social and demographic changes that leave white Christian men feeling disempowered, a complex set of forces that Republicans often lump together as wokeness. Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, who had voted against the last two Republican speakers before initially opposing Mr. McCarthy as well, claimed last year that the United States was imperiled by Democrats who \u201chate America, they hate people who love America, and they hate the religion and the descendants of the people who built America.\u201d That\u2019s not the kind of problem a Republican speaker can fix. Conservatives often quote an aphorism by the right-wing blogger Andrew Breitbart: \u201cPolitics is downstream from culture.\u201d The point is that passing laws and winning elections don\u2019t ultimately matter if your opponents control the entertainment Americans consume and the values they learn in school. And for many conservatives, it\u2019s self-evident that the big shifts in American culture \u2014 fewer Americans identifying as Christian, more Americans seeing gender as fluid, a growing focus in universities and corporations on diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 are creating a society hostile to the values that conservatives prize. Despite Republican power in Washington, these shifts have produced a deep gloom among the party\u2019s base. A 2021 poll by the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life found that white evangelical Protestants \u2014 the heart and soul of the modern Republican Party \u2014 hold a bleaker view of America\u2019s future than any other major racial or religious group. They\u2019re more than 30 points less optimistic than Black Americans, the Democratic Party\u2019s most reliable voting bloc. As the conservative writer David French noted in 2019, \u201cone of the most striking aspects of modern Evangelical political thinking is its projection of inevitable decline.\u201d This pessimism is inextricably bound up with demographic change. A poll last year by the University of Maryland found that more than 60 percent of Republicans want to declare the United States a Christian nation. But according to the Pew Research Center, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has dropped to 64 percent as of 2020 from 90 percent in the 1970s. Almost 60 percent of Republicans believe that \u201cAmerican customs and values\u201d will grow weaker if white people lose their demographic majority. But non-Hispanic white people now constitute only about 60 percent of the population, down from around 80 percent in 1980, and already make up a minority of Americans under the age of 16.\n\nEven with the speaker\u2019s gavel, there\u2019s not much that Mr. McCarthy can do about this. Grass-roots Republicans demand that Washington seal the southern border. But even if the United States stopped all legal and illegal immigration tomorrow, the white share of the population would continue to decline because white Americans are significantly older than the population at large. Even Republicans\u2019 biggest policy victory \u2014 ending constitutional protections for abortion by remaking the Supreme Court \u2014 won\u2019t end conservative discomfort with changing gender norms. A 2020 survey by the research firm PerryUndem found that Americans who oppose abortion rights are also deeply hostile to the #MeToo movement and believe that \u201cmost women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist.\u201d Overturning Roe won\u2019t change the fact that most Republicans think American society discriminates against men. The Republican politicians most beloved by the party\u2019s base answer these fears by picking fights with the representatives of woke culture. Mr. Trump insulted Black athletes who knelt during the national anthem, female journalists who asked uncomfortable questions and liberal philanthropists who he suggested funded caravans of central American migrants. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a likely Republican presidential candidate in 2024, is now following suit: penalizing Disney for defending L.G.B.T.Q. rights, sending undocumented immigrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and declaring that his state is \u201cwhere woke goes to die.\u201d Presidents and governors can define themselves through such performative gestures. So can congressional backbenchers like Senator Marsha Blackburn, who last year challenged Ketanji Brown Jackson during her Supreme Court nomination hearings to \u201cprovide a definition for the word \u2018woman.\u2019\u201d But legislative leaders can\u2019t build a political identity on owning the libs. They\u2019re too associated with lawmaking, a process in which many Republicans have lost faith as they submit to cultural despair. Two years ago, a Republican president incited an attack on Congress. Today most Republicans describe that as \u201ca legitimate protest.\u201d Ultimately, the Republican Party\u2019s problem isn\u2019t with Mr. McCarthy. It\u2019s with the institution he leads, an institution that can\u2019t restore the America of the 1980s, no matter who\u2019s in charge.

The characters Joel and Ellie in the 2013 game \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d which is now the basis of an HBO series, the network\u2019s first video game adaptation.\n\nThe pop culture landscape is littered with bad adaptations of hit video games, from the notoriously awful 1993 film \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d to the recently canceled series \u201cResident Evil,\u201d on Netflix. HBO hopes to buck that trend with its first, \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d based on the wildly popular video game series about the survivors of a devastating pandemic. After years of being stuck in development purgatory as a potential movie, the adaptation has evolved into one of this winter\u2019s most hotly anticipated shows, starring Pedro Pascal (\u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d) and Bella Ramsey (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d). Premiering on Sunday, the nine-episode first season largely follows the outline of the first PlayStation game, from 2013, which to date has sold over 20 million copies. New to the franchise? Here\u2019s what to know about the series before it debuts. Developed by the video game company Naughty Dog, \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d is a deeply cinematic game set after the collapse of civilization, caused by a parasitic fungus that turns people into brain-dead, flesh-ripping monsters. The game was an instant success \u2014 a divisive 2020 sequel likewise sold millions \u2014 and it was targeted for adaptation almost immediately. In 2014, the production studio Screen Gems announced that it would be distributing a Sam Raimi-produced film version of the game, with Kaitlyn Dever and the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Maisie Williams as early contenders to play the female lead. In 2016, the project stalled over creative disagreements about the tone of the film, with one of the lead developers of the game, Neil Druckmann, saying that he had wanted a movie resembling \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d while the studio wanted \u201cWorld War Z.\u201d Then in March 2020, HBO announced it would be producing a series created by Druckmann and Craig Mazin, the creator of HBO\u2019s Emmy-winning \u201cChernobyl.\u201d Part zombie flick, part road picture, the result (based on an advance screening of the first nine episodes) is a bleak, post-apocalyptic television drama with echoes of \u201cChildren of Men,\u201d \u201cThe Road\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d The bulk of Season 1 takes place in 2023, two decades after a heartbreaking prologue in which Joel (Pascal), a construction contractor and single father from Austin, sees his life fall apart and the pandemic take hold. By our present year, the world has been torn apart not only by the vicious creatures who were once human but also by a brutal military dictatorship. For everyone else, it\u2019s often kill or be killed. Bella Ramsey (left, with Anna Torv) plays Joel\u2019s traveling partner Ellie in the HBO series. In this dystopian future, where Boston has become a walled city, Joel meets a switchblade-wielding teenage girl named Ellie (Ramsey), who is being held captive by a rebel group known as the Fireflies. The Fireflies have discovered that Ellie is immune to the fungus and may, therefore, hold the key to humanity\u2019s survival. When Joel\u2019s brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna), goes missing, Joel, who in this new world has become an intrepid smuggler, agrees to smuggle Ellie outside the walls. In exchange, the Fireflies give him the supplies he needs to search for his brother. Things go quickly wrong, and the cross-country journey begins. Most of the supporting characters in the HBO version of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d will be familiar to players of the game, including Joel\u2019s smuggling partner (and seeming romantic partner), Tess (Anna Torv), and the Fireflies leader Marlene (Merle Dandridge, who also voiced the character in the game). Fans of the game series will also recognize the brothers Henry (Lamar Johnson) and Sam (Keivonn Woodard); Ellie\u2019s former ally Riley (Storm Reid); and the malevolent David (Scott Shepherd), a cult leader with dark secrets of his own. A few major characters, however, won\u2019t be so recognizable. Nick Offerman plays the familiar smuggler Bill, but his role in the series is very different. Another character named Frank, who is only a dead body in the game, is brought to life by Murray Bartlett in the series. A vicious revolutionary named Kathleen, played by Melanie Lynskey, is entirely new. Mazin and Druckmann also found small onscreen roles for the game\u2019s main voice actors, including Troy Baker (who voices Joel in the game), Ashley Johnson (who voices Ellie) and Jeffrey Pierce (Tommy). Even the game\u2019s original composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, returns to do the TV score. Merle Dandridge (left, with Natasha Mumba) plays the character she voiced in the video game, a leader of the resistance group the Fireflies. The big question for fans of the video game is, how faithful will the series be to its source material? Early signs suggest the answer is \u201cvery,\u201d with the show including most of the major characters and plot points. It even incorporates material from the excellent expansion prequel to the game titled \u201cLeft Behind.\u201d Without the action-first requirements of a video game, Druckmann and Mazin seem freed to deepen the dominant themes. As a result, the show tells an even more character-driven, grounded story about a broken man who is stuck in the past and the traumatized girl who forces him to rediscover his own humanity, equal partners in a symbiotic hero\u2019s journey. Joel has barely scraped by for 20 years when he meets Ellie, but she gives him reason to hope again, even as their road winds through unspeakable violence. Unlike a lot of child-in-distress characters, Ellie is extremely tough; she grew up in this world, and her arc is as essential as Joel\u2019s. The game has been lauded for its diversity of characters in a medium often dominated by macho male protagonists, and that hasn\u2019t been lost in translation.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe appointment of Ms. Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The Times, is a part of a broad overhaul of the news division at NBCUniversal.\n\nNBCUniversal has appointed Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, as the president of editorial for NBC News, as part of a far-reaching reorganization of the division. Ms. Blumenstein, 56, has overseen The Times\u2019s recruiting efforts and operations as part of the newsroom\u2019s top management team and advised the paper\u2019s publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. At NBC, she will inherit many of the responsibilities of Noah Oppenheim, who has been president of NBC News since 2017. He has struck a production deal with NBCUniversal, working on film and TV projects for the company. With the appointment, Cesar Conde, who oversees NBCUniversal\u2019s news division, is turning over major parts of his marquee news brand to a highly decorated print and digital journalist, but one with little experience in television. Ms. Blumenstein, a Michigan native, is a former foreign correspondent who served as deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal before joining the senior leadership of The Times in 2017. She will take charge of the network\u2019s sprawling reporting operation as it seeks to expand its digital audience amid a long-term decline in broadcast TV viewership.\n\nIn a reorganization led by Mr. Conde, who as chairman of NBCUniversal News Group also runs CNBC and MSNBC, Ms. Blumenstein will oversee household-brand shows like \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and \u201cDateline.\u201d Some significant parts of NBC News overseen by Mr. Oppenheim will now report directly to Mr. Conde, including the network\u2019s flagship program, \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d and the lucrative \u201cToday\u201d franchise of morning programming. The cable channels MSNBC and CNBC do not fall under Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s portfolio and will continue to be led by their own presidents.\n\nDuring her tenure at The Times, Ms. Blumenstein helped develop new formats to cover big breaking news events in real time, part of The Times\u2019s aggressive expansion of its digital journalism. She led the evacuation and resettlement of the company\u2019s Afghan employees and their families in the wake of the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Kabul in 2021. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Blumenstein said that she was grateful to Mr. Sulzberger and Joe Kahn, the executive editor of The Times, for their \u201ccommitment to independent journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe news landscape is rapidly evolving,\u201d Ms. Blumenstein said. \u201cI look forward to building on the deep journalistic foundation at NBC News to help the organization achieve its ambitions.\u201d At The Journal, Ms. Blumenstein led a team of China correspondents to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. In China, she got to know Mr. Kahn, then a fellow foreign correspondent; Mr. Kahn appointed Ms. Blumenstein to his senior leadership team when he became The Times\u2019s executive editor last year. Her departure comes a few weeks after The Times announced that Clifford Levy, another deputy managing editor, would move to the company\u2019s business side later this year as deputy publisher of The Athletic and Wirecutter. In a note to Times employees, Mr. Kahn said that \u201cNBC News is very lucky to have\u201d Ms. Blumenstein. \u201cAs I learned when we worked for rival news organizations covering China, she is a superb, competitive journalist who is also a delightful colleague,\u201d Mr. Kahn wrote. At NBC, Mr. Oppenheim leaves his role after a six-year tenure that coincided with huge changes in the business model of TV news and the frenetic pace of the Trump presidency and a worldwide pandemic. An NBC veteran who began as a producer for the Chris Matthews show \u201cHardball,\u201d Mr. Oppenheim took on major roles at CNBC and \u201cToday\u201d before ascending to lead NBC News. He led an expansion of the network\u2019s digital operations, including the debut of a fast-growing ad-supported streaming service, NBC News Now. NBC News Now generates more than 30 million hours of viewership monthly, the network said. His tenure was also marked by controversy. Ronan Farrow, a former journalist and anchor at MSNBC, accused leadership at NBCUniversal, including Mr. Oppenheim, of trying to conceal a blockbuster investigation into allegations of sexual assault against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Oppenheim said that Mr. Farrow\u2019s story, as reported for the network, did not meet its standards for publication. Tensions related to the episode spilled into public, including an extraordinary on-air moment when Rachel Maddow said she had deep concerns about the organization\u2019s handling of the story. NBC News renewed Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s contract after the episode.\n\nIn a memo on Wednesday, Mr. Oppenheim said he was proud that NBC News remains \u201cthe gold standard in journalism,\u201d adding: \u201cSharing this front-row seat to history with the smartest, most committed and most compassionate colleagues has been a tremendous privilege.\u201d Mr. Conde, in appointing a veteran newspaper journalist to a key role, appeared to send a firm signal that he believes his organization\u2019s future will be increasingly digital and less dependent on traditional broadcast programming. In a memo on Wednesday, he said that NBC\u2019s news operations would evolve \u201cto stay ahead of the many changes in the technology that delivers the news.\u201d Ms. Blumenstein, he wrote, would \u201cdrive our journalism and original content across our broadcast and digital platforms as they continue to converge.\u201d Since Mr. Conde started as chairman in 2020, he has remade the news division\u2019s executive ranks, appointing Rashida Jones as president of MSNBC and KC Sullivan as president of CNBC. The \u201cToday\u201d franchise will continue to be led by Libby Leist, a long-serving steward of the morning franchise. \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d will continue to be led by Janelle Rodriguez, another NBC veteran who will also continue to oversee NBC News Now. Along with his ongoing role at NBCUniversal, Mr. Oppenheim is developing a limited series at Netflix starring Robert DeNiro. Tentatively titled \u201cZero Day,\u201d the series is described as a political thriller in which Mr. DeNiro portrays an ex-president who returns to run the country in the wake of a major catastrophe. Mr. Oppenheim\u2019s collaborators on the series include Eric Newman, the showrunner of the drug trafficking drama \u201cNarcos,\u201d and Michael S. Schmidt, a reporter at The Times. Mr. Oppenheim is not the first media executive to daydream about jumping to the entertainment side, but he is rare among his peers in having found some success in that endeavor: He wrote the screenplay for the 2016 biopic \u201cJackie\u201d starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy, the former first lady.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRe \u201cPrince Harry and the Value of Silence,\u201d by Patti Davis (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Jan. 7): I have not watched the Netflix documentary, nor do I plan to read Prince Harry\u2019s book about his family. Ms. Davis\u2019s essay expressed my sentiments exactly. We do not need to know people\u2019s private family matters, and I think no good can come of this. I feel for Harry in that he is young and in time may come to regret his actions. This royal life seems to be a very unhappy one, and I do hope that things come out well for him in the end, but I do not see that airing your dirty laundry is going to help matters. The British have a word for it: \u201cwhingeing.\u201d The closest we Americans can come to it is \u201ccrying in your beer.\u201d Whatever you want to call it, Harry has been wallowing in it.\n\nWhile he may deserve a modicum of sympathy for having been born into a life that was largely preordained, he could have made a gracious exit. His uncle Prince Edward had the gumption to separate himself from monarchical constraints and forge a career in his own right, apart from the pomp and ceremony of the royal court. Prince Harry could have done the same thing. He instead chose to exploit the prerogatives of his birth while at the same time reviling the system that offered him the platform to air his puerile grievances. Re \u201cWhy Is America So Taken With These Two?,\u201d by Pamela Paul (column, Jan. 10): Even though Harry\u2019s TV interviews and book might be self-serving, it doesn\u2019t matter to most Americans. He comes off as a smart, decent human being, just as vulnerable as the rest of us, a likable bloke. In 1776, when Americans declared their independence from the throne, the British press reacted with contempt. Over 200 years later, when Prince Harry declared his independence from the monarchy, the British press responded with scorn. Some things never change. I don\u2019t know why entitled narcissists whose claim to fame is being famous seem so appealing, but I suspect it\u2019s for the same reason the Kardashians are millionaires and Donald Trump improbably became president.\n\nIf only we gave the same support to those with character, ability and talent. Pamela Paul asks why Americans have a \u201cparticular crush\u201d on the Sussexes. There\u2019s not a lot of evidence that they do. Our media, however, seem to believe that the U.S. public is fascinated by and even admirers of royalty. Perhaps our columnists and TV commentators are overly influenced by the British tabloids\u2019 intense coverage of royalty. The tabloids also whipped up support in the U.K. for Brexit; that\u2019s not turning out very well. And there\u2019s always an audience for circuses and spectacles of all sorts. Could I please see by a show of hands all those who have had more than enough of Harry and Meghan?\n\nIt is the responsibility of the society to educate, instill civilized values and put proper controls on behavior, as well as protect its youths from others and themselves. This role is assigned both to parents or other primary caretakers and to societal institutions such as schools, law enforcement and government. In our culture, gun use and attitudes toward gun ownership have surpassed reasonableness to the level of immorality. We can\u2019t be in denial about this fact and we must address this problem, as a 6-year-old packing and violently using a handgun makes clear.\n\nIt is no surprise that the list of names etched onto the granite of the Korean War Veterans Memorial includes incorrect information and that there are names missing. Even if the results of the Barker brothers\u2019 work \u2014 the Korean War Project \u2014 had been properly utilized, some errors and omissions would have been inevitable. Isn\u2019t there a role for technology here? Instead of permanently engraved names that are difficult and costly to revise, why not add a multimedia exhibit where individual names could be searched and displayed, perhaps with photos and a line or two about veterans\u2019 wartime experiences? It could easily be updated and corrected, probably for a very reasonable price. If such technology is ever included, I hope the Barker brothers\u2019 extraordinary work and dedication to this project are highlighted. Thank you for calling attention to their efforts.\n\nRe \u201cYour Memories. Their Cloud\u201d (Sunday Business, Jan. 1), about the risks of storing important data on technology companies\u2019 servers: This was a very timely article articulating the need to drastically reduce our personal digital data storage. But an issue not mentioned by the writer is the lack of security offered by digital storage methods in addition to the cloud. Cloud storage is fine, but its vendors provide no guarantee that your data is safe, nor do they compensate for lost data. The problem with all other storage technologies \u2014 be they CDs, hard drives, magnetic tapes or thumb drives \u2014 is that they all have finite and often remarkably short lifetimes, putting critical data at risk. Further, magnetic and semiconductor storage are especially susceptible to the rare solar flare that may strike the earth at any time. Considerable work is currently underway to develop new archival storage technologies that will successfully store data for centuries without change. Clark E.

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe firm\u2019s chief executive, David Solomon, has given the task of determining which divisions will be affected to a chief lieutenant.\n\nJob cuts have begun at Goldman Sachs. A wave that\u2019s expected to grow to as many as 3,200 layoffs, one of the largest by the bank since the 2008 financial crisis, started on Tuesday, including at its premier equity capital markets division, sources told DealBook. More across-the-board cuts are expected to be announced on Wednesday. They may be the biggest cuts on Wall Street \u2014 an unusual situation for the elite bank, which has struggled for months to revamp its operations and stem a fall in its stock price. They\u2019re also part of an expansive effort to review and cut costs across the firm, The Financial Times reports. It\u2019s a tall task that has fallen in large part on Ericka Leslie, Goldman\u2019s chief administrative officer, in close consultation with David Solomon, the C.E.O., and John Waldron, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer. Who is Ms. Leslie? She grew up in Clifton Park, in upstate New York, where she worked for her father\u2019s small light-fixture sales company. She credits that experience for teaching her how to be self-reliant in business: In an interview for Infosys, she said, \u201cI remember very vividly when I first came to Goldman Sachs, and I called my father and said, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not going to believe this, but when the light goes out, someone comes in and fixes it.\u2019\u201d Ms. Leslie joined Goldman in 1996, starting in the firm\u2019s finance division, before making partner in 2012. She became global head of operations for the securities division in 2018 and then administrative chief last January.\n\nSpending on nearly everything is under review, according to the F.T., from Goldman\u2019s embattled consumer-finance operations to travel. A particularly sensitive focus is the firm\u2019s two Gulfstream jets, which the bank bought in 2019 in a reversal from a previous reliance on the NetJets rental service. (Mr. Solomon has been criticized for his repeated use of the corporate planes.) Ms. Leslie\u2019s biggest concern may be dealing with anxious bankers. A year ago, Goldman paid out hefty bonuses to retain talent; now employees are expecting steep cuts to their bonuses, or worse. One banker told DealBook he immediately checked his phone when he woke up yesterday to see if he still had a job. Others are speculating whether the traders who moved to Goldman\u2019s outpost in West Palm Beach, Fla., have made themselves vulnerable \u2014 particularly since Marc Nachmann, until recently the co-head of that division, will now spend more time in New York overseeing the firm\u2019s newly merged asset and wealth management division. We may learn more about what Leslie is up against later this week. Goldman is set to release a regulatory filing restating its finances for the past three years, under a sweeping restructuring it announced in October. We\u2019ll be looking out for possible losses in the firm\u2019s consumer and asset-management division, as well as more insight on the costs Leslie is seeking to rein in. U.S. flights are grounded amid an F.A.A. computer outage. The agency said it was trying to fix a service that publishes essential information for flight-operations workers and cautioned that it had \u201cno estimate for restoration of service.\u201d\n\nVince McMahon wrests back control of W.W.E. The pro-wrestling franchise\u2019s directors installed him as executive chairman, less than a week after his return to its board. In a story line as dramatic as any in W.W.E., his return led to the departure of his daughter, Stephanie, as chairwoman and co-C.E.O. \u2014 and could pave the way for the company\u2019s sale. The Trump Organization\u2019s ex-C.F.O. is sentenced to jail. Allen Weisselberg, who worked for the Trump family for a half-century, will serve five months at Rikers Island for his role in a tax fraud scheme. He had testified against the Trump Organization, helping lead to its fraud conviction last year. The World Bank cuts global growth forecasts. It said it expected worldwide G.D.P. to grow 1.7 percent this year, half what it predicted in June. That leaves the global economy vulnerable to a recession this year, the World Bank warned. Wells Fargo retreats from mortgage lending. Once one of the largest U.S. home lenders, the bank will limit itself to loans for existing customers, wealth management clients and borrowers in minority communities. The move comes amid pressure from regulators and higher interest rates that have cut into mortgage-lending profits. A new year brings a leadership reshuffle to the ranks of Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessey, the world\u2019s largest luxury goods group by sales, as Bernard Arnault continues to promote his children to key posts within his empire, writes the Times\u2019s Elizabeth Paton. The management changes were announced Wednesday morning, and the stock rallied. Mr. Arnault, the world\u2019s richest person, appointed his daughter Delphine to run Dior, LVMH\u2019s second-largest brand. Pietro Beccari, who has been Dior C.E.O. since 2018, was named the chief executive of LVMH\u2019s flagship brand Louis Vuitton, which accounts for almost two-thirds of the company\u2019s annual operating profit.\n\nMichael Burke, the longtime Louis Vuitton CEO and one of Mr. Arnault\u2019s longest-serving executives, will remain at the group and continue to work alongside the 73-year-old Arnault, without detailing his new role. The appointments were first reported by Miss Tweed. They are the latest moves by Mr. Arnault, LVMH\u2019s chairman, to secure a succession plan at the luxury group by putting his children in key executive roles. The luxury conglomerate has become a family affair. Antoine Arnault, 45, is C.E.O. of Christian Dior SE, the holding company through which the Arnaults control LVMH. Alexandre Arnault, 30, is the executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Company. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arnault, 27, is the chief executive of TAG Heuer. Jean Arnault, 24, was promoted in November to the role of watches director at Louis Vuitton. \u201cSuccession planning in strategic roles has been instrumental to the success of LVMH\u2019s key brands over the past 20 years, hence today\u2019s moves are significant,\u201d said Thomas Chauvet, analyst with Citi. LVMH stock gained nearly 2 percent in Paris this morning, and is up more than 11 percent in 2023, adding nearly $40 billion in market capitalization. Demand for LVMH handbags, shoes and designer clothes has proved robust, even with the global economy in a downturn and Covid hurting sales in mainland China, one of its most important global markets. The crypto industry is turning on itself, with Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss, co-founders of the exchange Gemini, publicly accusing their one-time business partner and his firms of committing a massive fraud that\u2019s costing their customers millions.\n\nThe twins say Digital Currency Group, the crypto conglomerate that\u2019s been hit hard by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX and the wider drop in crypto asset values, should force out its founder and C.E.O., Barry Silbert. Gemini says it was misled by Silbert and DCG. Tyler Winkelvoss told DealBook that DCG failed to come clean about the financial health of its crypto lending outfit, Genesis Global Capital \u2014 a Gemini trading partner. Genesis froze withdrawals in the days after FTX went bankrupt in November, leaving about 340,000 customers of one of its most popular offerings, Gemini Earn, unable to get their money, as the funds were tied up in Genesis. The Winkelvosses calculate customer losses at about $900 million. Gemini has been negotiating to get that money back. But those talks have now turned nasty, with the Winkelvosses saying Silbert and Genesis deliberately duped them and are obstructing a resolution. Adding to the turmoil, Gemini Earn investors have filed a proposed class action lawsuit in federal court against Gemini and the Winkelvosses. Gemini has argued that the case should be aimed at Genesis and DCG instead. The troubles began last summer when DCG swooped in with a $1.1 billion lifeline to save the cash-strapped Genesis. The deal was presented as a capital infusion, Tyler Winkelvoss told DealBook, but it was actually a promissory note, due in ten years. \u201cThe problem is it\u2019s not worth $1.1 billion, and they led us to believe it was,\u201d he said. The note was \u201cstuffed and hidden in the balance sheet in a place it\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he said, and they didn\u2019t make the discovery until after the collapse of FTX. \u201cIt has been challenging to have my integrity and good intentions questioned,\u201d Mr. Silbert wrote in a letter to DCG shareholders on Tuesday. He did not address claims that the deal with Genesis was mischaracterized, saying only that the promissory note was \u201crecommended by our financial and legal advisors.\u201d\n\u2022 None The world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, is bleeding assets, and Coinbase, the only publicly listed exchange in the U.S., is laying off employees.\n\u2022 None New court documents reveal the now-likely worthless stakes of FTX shareholders, including Peter Thiel, Tom Brady, Gisele B\u00fcndchen and Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots.\n\u2022 None Four U.S. senators are questioning whether the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell has a conflict of interest in serving as counsel for the FTX bankruptcy.\n\u2022 None There\u2019s a new revelation that Sam Bankman-Fried invested $20 million in a crypto venture capital fund that then took an investment in his FTX.\n\u2022 None Puck\u2019s Theodore Schleiffer interviewed Bankman-Fried at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. They covered Bankman-Fried\u2019s vegan burgers and video game habit, and his claim that he\u2019s given away up to $300 million to various charitable causes. \u201cWe are not, and will not be, a \u2018climate policymaker.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Jay Powell, the Fed chair, at a conference in Sweden, pushing back against calls for the U.S. central bank to take a more active role in mitigating climate risk.\n\nNews that Microsoft is reportedly weighing an investment of as much as $10 billion in the parent company of ChatGPT, the A.I.-powered chatbot whose natural-sounding interactions have entered mainstream culture, has become the talk of the tech world. If Microsoft goes through with an investment in OpenAI, it could give the software giant a leg up on its archrival, Google, in a technology that Google itself sees as \u201ca code red\u201d challenge to its cash-cow search business. A deeper partnership with Microsoft could give OpenAI a major advantage over competitors in this disruptive tech field. Microsoft may double down on an already successful bet. In 2019, the company invested $1 billion in OpenAI in exchange for the right to integrate the start-up\u2019s work into its own products. It has since incorporated OpenAI technology into a coding tool, but new reports suggest that much more consequential team-ups are in the offing: putting the tech in the search engine Bing and widely used productivity software like Word. \u201cThe next wave is really right up on us, which is definitely A.I.,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., told investors last month, specifically citing ChatGPT. \u201cWe are very, very well structured to capitalize on this wave.\u201d The cost of a new deal could very well be worth it. The potential transaction would be among the biggest Microsoft has ever struck. (One question is whether it would be caught up in antitrust scrutiny, as Microsoft\u2019s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard has.) Microsoft is trying to engineer a deal devoid of financial risk, according to Semafor. The potential alliance would give it the bulk of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment, and Microsoft would own nearly half of the A.I. start-up. More important, a deal would further tie the data-intensive OpenAI to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service (more on that later).",

            "content": "It is striking that in the same year that Tesla\u2019s stock price dropped by about two-thirds, destroying more than $700 billion in market value, the global market for electric vehicles \u2014 which for so long the company seemed almost to embody \u2014 actually boomed. Boom may not even adequately communicate what happened. Around the world, E.V. sales were projected to have grown 60 percent in 2022, according to a BloombergNEF report prepared ahead of the 2022 U.N. climate conference COP27, bringing total sales over 10 million. There are now almost 30 million electric vehicles on the road in total, up from just 10 million at the end of 2020. E.V. market share has also tripled since 2020. The pandemic years can feel a bit like a vacuum, but there are almost three times as many E.V.s on the world\u2019s roads now as there were when Covid vaccines were first approved, and what looked not that long ago like a climate pipe dream is now undeniably underway: a genuine transition away from fossil-fueled transportation. This week, the Biden administration released a blueprint toward a net zero transportation sector by 2050. It\u2019s an ambitious goal, especially for such a car-intoxicated culture as ours. But it\u2019s also one that, thanks to trends elsewhere in the world, is beginning to seem more and more plausible, at least on the E.V. front. In Norway, electric vehicles now represent four out of every five new cars sold; the figure was just one in five as recently as 2016. In Germany, more than 55 percent of new cars registered in December were electric or hybrid. In China, where more electric vehicles are sold than everywhere else in the world combined, the rise is perhaps even more dramatic: from 3.5 percent of the market at the beginning of 2020 to 20.3 percent at the beginning of 2022. And growing, of course: Nearly twice as many electric vehicles were sold last year in China as in the year before. The country also exported $3.2 billion worth of E.V.s last November alone, more than double the exports of the previous November. Its largest single manufacturer, BYD, has surpassed Tesla for global market share \u2014 so perhaps it should not be so surprising that Tesla\u2019s stock is dimming while the global outlook is so sunny.\n\nThis is not just eye-popping growth; it is also dramatically faster than most analysts were projecting just a few years ago. In 2020, the International Energy Agency projected that the global share of electric vehicle sales would not top 10 percent before 2030. It appears we\u2019ve already crossed that bar eight years early, and BloombergNEF now projects that the market share of E.V.s will approach 40 percent by the end of the decade. (The I.E.A. is less bullish but has still roughly doubled its 2030 projection in just two years.) The underlying production capacity is perhaps even more encouraging. In the United States, investments in battery manufacturing reached a record $73 billion last year \u2014 three times as much as the previous record, set the year before. Globally, battery manufacturing capacity grew almost 40 percent last year, and is projected to grow fivefold by just 2025. By that year, lithium mining is expected to be triple what it was in 2021. We\u2019ve seen this phenomenon before, with many other areas of the green transition experiencing similarly shocking exponential or quasi-exponential growth: renewable energy investments in the United States quadrupling in a decade, global investments in clean tech growing more than 30-fold over the same period, a solar supply chain already big enough to facilitate a total transition. It\u2019s enough to make many optimistic observers giddy with anticipation of what\u2019s to come. It is tempting to believe that designing a future is as simple as drawing the right trajectory on a whiteboard. But as with everything else when it comes to climate, the challenge is bigger than that \u2014 indeed, the fact that trend lines are beginning to point in the right direction can be a kind of false comfort, since technologies like these don\u2019t just descend from the cloud onto the world\u2019s phones. And the scientist Vaclav Smil\u2019s gloomy comparisons to previous energy transitions aside, the world hasn\u2019t undertaken a breakneck allover revolution like this ever before in its history. Do the familiar, S-shaped learning curves of technological adaptation mean that it should be very easy, and indeed remunerative, for the world to get on track to limit warming below two degrees Celsius, or even 1.5 degrees, as a much talked about paper produced by Oxford\u2019s Institute for New Economic Thinking has suggested? Or, as the scholar Jessica Jewell has argued in the journal Nature Energy and elsewhere, do the limitations of practical obstacles and political economy mean that, even assuming those encouraging learning curves, much more would have to be done to ensure technological adoption at that speed? Here the E.V. revolution is an illuminating case study. To stabilize global temperatures, we have to get emissions basically all the way down to zero, not just reduce them \u2014 an interesting November paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters suggests it might be better to aim for \u201capproximately\u201d net zero emissions, since it may be the case that global temperatures could stabilize even if emissions aren\u2019t entirely eliminated. To do that, we need to stop burning fossil fuels in cars, not just supplement the existing fleet with slightly more green alternatives. A rapid growth in market share isn\u2019t itself sufficient, in other words, because \u2014 like carbon itself, which hangs in the air for centuries at least \u2014 dirty cars stay on the road for a very long time, emitting all the while. Economists call this a problem of stocks rather than flows. In this case, while the \u201cflows\u201d are indeed impressive, the \u201cstock\u201d of E.V.s on the road is probably only 2 percent of the global fleet, which still isn\u2019t close to 100 percent at all.\n\nRapid growth also opens up a new landscape of challenges. We used to worry whether there would be sufficient demand for electric vehicles, particularly given their cost and range limitations. But demand already outstrips supply, which, in addition to driving up the cost of E.V.s and creating manufacturing and delivery delays, has given rise to anxiety over the next roadblock: the empire of mineral extraction, refinement and production that has to be built to meet that. That obstacle may be in some ways smaller than it appears, as Hannah Ritchie, among others, has emphasized: We are not yet mining enough lithium to meet demand, but it\u2019s not exactly a scarce resource, and even Ritchie\u2019s relatively conservative estimates suggest there is more than enough for a battery vehicle revolution. Those taking a broader view of the ecological costs of this project, like the activist Thea Riofrancos, worry over a different set of unresolved questions: Is it possible to design a system for extracting and producing these materials in anything close to a responsible way? One possible approach, flagged by the Volts newsletter writer David Roberts, among others: actually recycling batteries, treating lithium as a \u201crenewable\u201d rather than endlessly extracted resource. Behind that challenge lies another: Will production of electric vehicles be interrupted by potential deglobalization in green industries or by America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which requires that a portion of E.V. batteries\u2019 parts be sourced or manufactured domestically or by certain trading partners to qualify for tax credits? At the moment, China produces about 75 percent of all E.V. battery cells, manufactures roughly the same share of those cell components and does more refining of many of the biggest raw inputs than the rest of the world combined. There are also problems of what the civil engineer Emily Grubert has memorably called the \u201cmid-transition\u201d: \u201cthis period in between kind of a stable fossil fuel dominated energy system and a future stable, clean energy dominated system.\u201d It is easy enough to imagine the other side of any transition, particularly when so many forces are moving in the right direction. But you have to get to that other side, and that is not just a matter of building out the new system but also, crucially, of maintaining some of the old one too, and in proper balance. If E.V.s and gas cars share the roads for a decade or two, how do you ensure or design the right mix of charging stations and gas pumps, and how do you map their locations? At what point do gas stations become unprofitable, and what happens then? These may seem like relatively technical questions, but the problems of the mid-transition extend to the matter of employment structures and pensions, the need for skilled labor to manage site cleanup and safety and the decline of funding from gas taxes for maintenance and infrastructure as gas consumption declines (if not all that rapidly to zero). The vast majority of electric vehicles are now sold in the world\u2019s richer economies, and mid-transition challenges like building out new charging infrastructure are potentially much larger in lower income countries. But there, at least for now, the electric vehicle revolution is taking a very different shape \u2014 often with two or three wheels rather than four. Globally, there are 10 times as many electric scooters, mopeds and motorcycles on the road as true electric cars, accounting already for almost half of all sales of those vehicles and responsible already for eliminating more carbon emissions than all the world\u2019s four-wheel E.V.s. It\u2019s been something of a secret revolution here, too: In 2020, Americans bought twice as many e-bikes as they did E.V.s. As with everything else on climate, it\u2019s not one story unfolding but many, and all at once.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTom Brady\u2019s comebacks and Dak Prescott\u2019s interceptions are just some of the statistical trends that could affect the results of first-round playoff games.\n\nIn the N.F.L. playoffs, teams are as evenly matched as they will have been all season. With opponents looking for whatever scant advantage exists, there are several statistical trends worth monitoring. Dropped passes, penalty yards, field-position differentials and fourth-quarter surges can all have a major impact on the results of this weekend\u2019s elimination games.\n\nBrady\u2019s patented comebacks are still big. It\u2019s the rest of his game that has grown smaller. His Buccaneers (8-9) overcame fourth-quarter deficits in four of their victories. Tampa Bay beat back a 13-6 fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Los Angeles Rams, 16-13, in Week 9. Brady overcame a 16-3 deficit to beat the New Orleans Saints, 17-16, in Week 13. Brady also led the Buccaneers back from trailing by 16-6 to beat the Arizona Cardinals, 19-16, in overtime in Week 16, and then the next week they trailed by 21-10 before defeating the Carolina Panthers, 30-24, to clinch the N.F.C. South. In those comebacks, the Buccaneers trailed by a combined 66-22 score in the fourth quarter, against opponents who ended the season with losing records. That does not exactly inspire confidence.\n\nAcross the first, second and third quarters of regular-season games, Brady threw just 12 touchdowns, fewer than the Bears\u2019 Justin Fields and the Texans\u2019 Davis Mills (13 each), beleaguered young quarterbacks whose teams combined for a 6-27-1 record and earned the right to the top two picks in the 2023 draft. Brady then threw 13 fourth-quarter touchdowns, seven of them while trailing in the final four minutes, sometimes (though not always) during heroic comebacks. Brady\u2019s sorcery will probably not be enough to advance the Buccaneers through the playoffs, but his knack for fourth-quarter touchdowns is reason for opponents not to give the ball back if they can avoid it. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott tied for the league lead with 15 interceptions and had the worst interception rate (3.8 percent) of any starter during the regular season. In each of his last seven games, he has thrown at least one interception and three of them have been returned for touchdowns. Prescott has been a fine quarterback aside from the interceptions, which is not quite like claiming that Sunday dinner was delicious except for the salmonella. Prescott finished the season tied for fourth in the N.F.L. in touchdown rate (5.8 percent). He often Houdinis his way out of the predicaments he helps cause, leading comeback victories against Houston in Week 14 and the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16. Prescott also isn\u2019t getting much support from teammates; his overtime interception against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 15, for example, was tipped in the air by his own receiver.\n\nA high interception rate does not preclude a Super Bowl victory: Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford tied for the N.F.L. lead with 17 interceptions in 2021, then threw three more in the postseason. Still, the Cowboys have a long and hilarious history of postseason pratfalls and will be much better off if they do not hand their opponent any easy opportunities. Especially since their opponent on Monday night is led by Tom Brady.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game between the Chargers and Jaguars promises to be a showdown of Justin Herbert and Trevor Lawrence, two of the N.F.L.\u2019s most promising young star quarterbacks. It could turn into a frustrating blooper reel, however: The Jaguars led the league with 41 dropped passes, according to Pro Football Reference, while the Chargers ranked second with 40 drops. Zay Jones led the Jaguars with 13 drops, while Christian Kirk dropped seven passes; Marvin Jones and the former Giants tight end Evan Engram added five each. Running back Austin Ekeler and tight end Gerald Everett led the Chargers with nine drops each, while the top receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, who were injured for much of the year, combined to drop three passes. Herbert therefore holds the advantage: He has two reliable targets at his disposal, while Lawrence has none. The 49ers begin their average offensive drive at their own 30.9-yard line, the best starting field position in the N.F.L., according to Football Outsiders. Their opponents, by contrast, are stuck starting their drives at their own 25.6-yard line, the worst starting field position in the league. The 49ers therefore net a league-high 5.24 yards per series, essentially tilting the field in their favor and muscling opponents back toward their own goal line. The 49ers also led the N.F.L. in turnover differential, with 13 more takeaways than giveaways. Their defense often gives the rookie quarterback Brock Purdy and his many playmakers the ball within easy striking distance of the end zone. The 49ers scored touchdowns on short drives after turnovers in each of their two regular-season victories over the Seattle Seahawks, a division rival they\u2019ll face again on Saturday. Even if the Seahawks manage to play turnover-free football, however, they may find themselves climbing uphill all afternoon.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings committed 88 penalties for just 689 yards in the regular season, according to nflpenalties.com. Their opponents committed 111 penalties for 926 yards. Their +237-yard penalty differential was the highest figure in the N.F.L., and it contributed to the sense that the often unimpressive Vikings were winning many of their games based though sheer luck. Some of the Vikings\u2019 penalty edge stemmed from the team\u2019s strengths. For example, opponents committed 11 defensive pass interference penalties for 158 yards in their desperate effort to cover receivers Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen. Some of the advantage may have come from experience and sound coaching: The Vikings committed just 12 offensive holding penalties, the second-lowest figure in the N.F.L. The rest of the differential may indeed have been the result of the team\u2019s purported probability-warping superpowers: Opponents were flagged a league-high six times for ineligible downfield receivers, a truly random infraction. The Giants must minimize their penalties against the Vikings on Sunday, especially since they cannot count on their passing game to bail them out of trouble.",

            "content": "An election rally for Benjamin Netanyahu in Sderot, Israel, in October. Mr. Netanyahu said this week that voters had given his government \u201ca clear and strong mandate.\u201d\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government is pushing to upend the judiciary, entrench Israeli control of the West Bank and strengthen ultraconservative Jews, fueling protests and deepening Israel\u2019s divisions.\n\nLess than two weeks into its tenure, the new government in Israel has moved quickly on a wave of far-right agenda items that would weaken the judiciary, entrench Israeli control of the West Bank and bifurcate the military chain of command to give some far-right ministers greater control of matters related to the occupation. On Wednesday night, the government moved forward with the centerpiece of its program \u2014 releasing for the first time a detailed plan for a sweeping judicial overhaul that includes reducing the Supreme Court\u2019s influence over Parliament and strengthening the government\u2019s role in the appointment of judges. Coalition leaders have also taken a more combative stance toward the Palestinians than their immediate predecessors. Funding to the Palestinian Authority has been cut, and the new minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has angered Palestinians and many Arab countries by touring a sensitive religious site and ordering the police to take down Palestinian flags.\n\nCurrently on trial for corruption, Mr. Netanyahu has presented his plans as the legitimate program of an elected government. He has also portrayed the push for judicial changes as a valid attempt to limit the interference of an unelected judiciary over an elected Parliament. \u201cWe received a clear and strong mandate from the public to carry out what we promised during the elections and this is what we will do,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech this week. \u201cThis is the implementation of the will of the voters and this is the essence of democracy.\u201d But his critics present it as a constitutional coup. \u201cThis is not a reform, this is an extreme regime change,\u201d said Yair Lapid, the previous prime minister, in a speech on Monday. \u201cThis does not fix democracy, this destroys democracy,\u201d he added. Returning to power for the third time, Mr. Netanyahu now heads a government that is Israel\u2019s most right-wing and religiously conservative administration ever, bringing together far-right parties supported by settlers and ultra-Orthodox parties that have vowed to reshape Israeli society.\n\nHe also wants to give politicians greater influence over the committee that appoints new judges. That would draw the Israeli judiciary closer to its counterpart in the United States, where senators confirm judicial appointments made by the president. But it is an unfamiliar idea in Israel, where senior judges and attorneys dominate the process of deciding who gets to be a judge. Supporters say this mechanism restricts political interference in the court, but to detractors it has turned the judiciary into a self-selecting club.\n\nMr. Netanyahu says he has no plans to use his new office to derail his corruption trial. But the political opposition says the judicial proposals are a harbinger of other legislation that could either reduce his potential punishment, legalize the crimes of which he\u2019s accused or undermine the attorney general who oversees his prosecution. \u201cHe\u2019s cooking up what he is really aiming for \u2014 an exemption from trial,\u201d said Benny Gantz, an opposition leader, in a speech last week. Thousands of demonstrators protested the plans across Israel last weekend, and opposition leaders have called for even bigger rallies on Saturday, prompting one government lawmaker, Zvika Fogel, to demand their arrest for \u201ctreason.\u201d To Palestinians, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government represents the most unequivocal Israeli opposition to Palestinian statehood since negotiations to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict gathered momentum in the 1990s. Successive Israeli leaders, including Mr. Netanyahu, had since left open the possibility of ceding parts of the West Bank to a future Palestinian state. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s new government, however, ended that ambiguity in late December. A list of the coalition\u2019s guiding principles began with a straightforward assertion of the Jewish people\u2019s \u201cexclusive and unquestionable right to all areas of the Land of Israel,\u201d a biblical term that encompasses both Israel and the occupied West Bank, and pledged to \u201cdevelop settlements in all parts of the Land of Israel.\u201d A separate side agreement between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, and another party in its coalition, Religious Zionism, also pledges that Mr. Netanyahu will lead efforts to formally annex the West Bank \u2014 albeit at a time of his choosing.\n\nThe government has also taken several combative steps against Palestinians. Ministers have cut roughly $40 million from the money the government sends the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, and removed travel privileges from several Palestinian leaders \u2014 mainly in retaliation against diplomatic measures taken by Palestinians against Israel at the United Nations. Mr. Ben-Gvir, the minister for national security, who holds criminal convictions for incitement of racism against Arabs and support for a Jewish terrorist group, has instructed the police to confiscate Palestinian flags flown in public in Israel. And last week, he provocatively toured the Aqsa Mosque compound \u2014 a deeply sensitive site sacred to both Muslims and Jews, who call it the Temple Mount \u2014 in what observers feared might set off another round of fighting with Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.\n\nThese moves all had precedents: Politicians have previously risked upheaval by visiting the compound, Israeli governments have often withheld money from the Palestinian Authority, and Israeli police officers have regularly confiscated Palestinian flags in the past. But the fast pace at which the government has acted has led to fears of more drastic \u2014 and more consequential \u2014 moves in the future, amid what is already the deadliest period in the territory for more than a decade. Within the Israeli military, senior officers are already braced for a showdown over who holds sway over the security forces that oversee the occupation of the West Bank.\n\nA law passed in late December is set to give Mr. Ben-Gvir unprecedented control over special police forces in the West Bank that were previously under the purview of the Army. The coalition agreements are also set to give Bezalel Smotrich, another hard-right settler leader, oversight over bureaucratic aspects of the occupation. Both moves have prompted disquiet in the military because they will create three centers of Israeli power in the West Bank. Among secular and liberal Israelis, there is rising concern about the government\u2019s plans to strengthen the autonomy of ultraconservative Jews, who form about 13 percent of Israel\u2019s nine million residents. Mr. Netanyahu agreed to protect funding for the ultra-Orthodox school system despite its failure to teach core subjects like math and English, and to formalize a longstanding arrangement that lets seminary students avoid military service. To secular Israelis, these measures will further limit the ability of ultra-Orthodox Israelis, known as Haredim, to participate in the economy and in the defense of the country \u2014 increasing the social and financial burden on secular Israelis. The government contains some secular members, like Amir Ohana, the first openly gay speaker of Parliament, and has officially promised to maintain the current balance between the secular and religious worlds. But because several key coalition leaders have already taken a combative line against secular and liberal society, some fear a looming broadside against religious and social pluralism. Avi Maoz, an ultraconservative who believes women should stay at home and wants to ban Jerusalem\u2019s gay pride parade, has been placed in charge of part of the education budget. Mr. Smotrich, who has described himself as a \u201cproud homophobe\u201d and expressed support for racial segregation in maternity wards, called late last year for soccer authorities to avoid holding games on the Jewish Sabbath.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Modern Jewish Orthodox school refuses to recognize an L.G.B.T.Q. student club, arguing in court that it is a religious institution.\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. For years, Yeshiva University has argued in court that its refusal to recognize an L.G.B.T.Q. student club does not violate New York City\u2019s human rights law because the school is a religious institution. But the university has also accepted state funding. And on Wednesday, a group of high-ranking state lawmakers said it appeared that the flagship Modern Jewish Orthodox school might have misrepresented itself as a secular institution on at least two occasions in order to qualify for more than $230 million in public funds to build and renovate its facilities and restructure its pre-existing debts. The suggestion came in the form of a letter from three New York State Senate committee chairs that gave Yeshiva 30 days to provide a full accounting, with supporting documents, of how it spent that money.\n\n\u201cI think this matter is worthy of investigation and a potential criminal inquiry, based on what we know from their own court testimony,\u201d said Senator Brad Hoylman, the chair of the Judiciary Committee and one of the signatories of the letter. \u201cThere is the potential that Yeshiva has misrepresented its mission and that could constitute fraud.\u201d Officials at Yeshiva did not respond to the lawmakers\u2019 letter on Wednesday. But Hanan Eisenman, a university spokesman, said in a statement that \u201cthe Supreme Court has three times ruled that the government may not restrict funding to religious schools because of their free exercise\u201d of religion. \u201cYeshiva will continue to defend the right of its students to be treated by the state on equal footing with students at every other university,\u201d Mr. Eisenman said in the statement. \u201cThey choose for themselves how best to live those values, but the First Amendment guarantees Yeshiva the right to maintain a campus environment consistent with its religious beliefs.\u201d The letter\u2019s suggestion that the school may have misrepresented itself as a secular institution was a significant escalation in Yeshiva\u2019s legal battle with its L.G.B.T.Q. students, which has brought a nationwide debate over religious freedom and civil rights to one of the country\u2019s most politically liberal cities. It also may jeopardize the ability of the university, which has more than 6,000 students on four campuses in Manhattan and the Bronx, to receive public funds in the future.\n\nIt is not clear what penalty, if any, the school might face, should it fail to provide the requested documents or is found to have misrepresented itself to obtain public funds. The legal dispute between Yeshiva and its L.G.B.T.Q. students is one front in a yearslong battle over whether religiously affiliated companies and organizations \u2014 or even pious individuals \u2014 must provide employment or other public accommodations to people with differing views or whose lifestyles they disapprove of. That dispute and the concerns raised over Yeshiva\u2019s receipt of public funds are centered around a murky yet timely debate: Should Yeshiva be considered an educational corporation governed by state education law, as its charter says it is, or should it be granted the legal protections of a religious corporation, which it has claimed to be in court testimony? Federal courts have taken an increasingly broad view of religious liberty in recent years, and religious freedom cases that have made it to the Supreme Court have almost always prevailed since Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the bench in 2020. The lawmakers\u2019 letter concerns money that was raised in 2009 and 2011 in two separate bond offerings by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, a public finance and construction agency that works with health care and education facilities across the state. Those bond offerings raised about $140 million in 2009 and $90 million in 2011, said the lawmakers, who include Senator Liz Krueger, the chair of the Finance Committee, and Senator Toby Ann Stavisky, the chair of the Committee on Higher Education. When Yeshiva received the money, it agreed the funds would not be spent on facilities used for \u201csectarian religious instruction or as a place of religious worship,\u201d they said. \u201cY.U.\u2019s discriminatory behavior is wholly inconsistent with the purposes for which state funding is provided, namely, to promote the fullest possible participation by all students in the state\u2019s educational opportunities,\u201d they wrote.\n\nMany Jewish congregations support L.G.B.T.Q. rights, but many Orthodox leaders interpret the Torah as promoting more traditional ideas of gender and sexuality. As such, Yeshiva\u2019s administrators say recognizing an L.G.B.T.Q. club would be incompatible with the school\u2019s religious values, and being legally forced to do so would violate its First Amendment rights. The Dormitory Authority acts as a conduit issuer for bonds to raise money on behalf of New York State or its clients, like Yeshiva. The authority has raised vast sums since it was founded in 1944, raising and disbursing more than $29 billion in the last four years alone. The authority has long worked with religiously affiliated educational institutions that serve the public, including Yeshiva University, as well as Fordham University and Siena College, which are both Catholic schools, said Jeffrey Gordon, an authority spokesman. But Mr. Gordon said the agency does not work with religious institutions like Catholic seminaries, which are legally permitted to limit enrollment to Catholic men. Since the L.G.B.T.Q. group sued Yeshiva in 2021, the university has argued it should be considered a religious institution, like a seminary, and not an educational corporation, like Fordham, which is subject to nondiscrimination law but also eligible to receive public funds. Judges have so far rejected that argument. In a ruling against the school last June, Justice Lynn R. Kotler of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan said Yeshiva\u2019s own charter clearly stated it to be \u201can educational corporation under the education law of the State of New York\u201d that was \u201corganized and operated exclusively for educational purposes.\u201d\n\nAfter that ruling, Yeshiva made an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which rejected the request and told the school to exhaust its appeals at the state level before approaching it again. In the meantime, the court ordered the school to recognize the L.G.B.T.Q. student club, known as the Pride Alliance. Last month, Yeshiva lost its appeal at the state level. \u201cWe find no violation of Yeshiva\u2019s free exercise of religion,\u201d wrote four judges from the New York Appellate Court in the decision. But Katherine Franke, the founder of the Law, Rights and Religion Project at Columbia University Law School, said the Supreme Court would likely view the case differently. She expressed doubt that Pride Alliance\u2019s lawsuit would prevail, and said public agencies like the Dormitory Authority may be compelled to continue their financial relationship with Yeshiva. She compared the situation to a recent Supreme Court case, Fulton vs. City of Philadelphia. The court ruled in 2021 that Philadelphia effectively discriminated against a Catholic social services agency that refused to place foster children with same-sex couples. \u201cTo withdraw public funding after having funded the school for so long lands you in sort of the same place as Catholic social services in the city of Philadelphia,\u201d said Professor Franke. \u201cWe are moving in the direction where states are obliged to fund religion because to not do so is to discriminate against religion.\u201d Yeshiva has been represented in the lawsuit by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a high-profile public-interest legal and education firm based in Washington, D.C.\n\nEric Baxter, the fund\u2019s vice president and the lead attorney on the Yeshiva case, has called the lower court rulings \u201cobviously mistaken\u201d and argued that no matter what the school\u2019s decades-old charter may say, Yeshiva\u2019s religious character is \u201cplain and obvious.\u201d In court, Mr. Baxter has shared documents that the school claims show how deeply religion shapes its operations, including a policy that encourages students to undertake intensive religious studies in Israel, with 80 percent doing so, and another requiring that male students study the Torah. Yeshiva has gone to great lengths to keep from recognizing the Pride Alliance as the school\u2019s appeals work their way through the courts. After the Supreme Court rejected Yeshiva\u2019s emergency appeal, the university said it would suspend all student clubs rather than recognize one for L.G.B.T.Q. students. That threat was neutralized when the Pride Alliance agreed to remain unrecognized while the case worked its way through the courts. Yeshiva then said in October that it would form its own \u201capproved traditional Orthodox alternative\u201d to the L.G.B.T.Q. student club in the form of a support group that would operate \u201cwithin the framework of Halakha,\u201d or Jewish religious law. The Pride Alliance rejected that as a form of top-down oversight that other clubs were not subjected to. Ms. Stavisky, the chair of the Higher Education Committee, said Yeshiva could not claim to be one thing for the purpose of accessing taxpayer money and then claim to be another thing for the purpose of evading nondiscrimination laws. \u201cThey have to decide which they want to be: an educational institution or a religious institution,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a cousin who graduated from Fordham and he was Jewish,\u201d added Ms. Stavisky. \u201cAnd Yeshiva has people who have graduated from it who are not Jewish. And that\u2019s the beauty of education in New York.\u201d",

Wearing the same boring coat over and over for months \u2014 months!!!!! \u2014 just for warmth is an expression of defeat. After all, it\u2019s pretty much all anyone will see of you on the street for a while. Don\u2019t let the cold weather or seasonal affective disorder win. What if your winter coat wasn\u2019t a workhorse but a show pony? What if the warmth it gave you was via super-luxurious fabric that swaddled you? What if it was a color other than black, navy or camel so the guy you see when you walk your dog refers to you as \u201cthat woman in the yellow coat\u201d? What if a winter coat was about potential? Vintage is a great move. Search Etsy or the RealReal (or the Gem app, which searches those places, along with sites like eBay, Grailed, Poshmark, Vestiaire Collective, even LiveAuctioneers), for one of the Phoebe Philo-era C\u00e9line llama wool coats (think 2015 to 2018 or so), buy it and worry about the price later. While you\u2019re looking for llama, try other fabrics like cashmere or, even better, vicu\u00f1a. It\u2019s probably a good idea to order coats that are returnable. Fit is certainly a consideration, but so is smell. Coats absorb odor, and even though dryer sheets and a fan can do a lot, it can\u2019t do much for the most perfect cashmere Bonwit Teller coat that has been in the home of a chain smoker since the 1970s.\n\nI talked a friend out of an overpriced but low-quality coat from a mid-tier French brand and told her to search for vintage MaxMara or Jil Sander or the Row coats and to text me the results because I love supervising a shopping quest and I love being bossy. It worked. She\u2019s now the proud owner of an espresso brown cashmere coat that was about a quarter of what she was going to pay. Here is what my dream coat wardrobe would be, each one a lesson in a winter well lived.\n\nCan you even talk about fancy winter coats without talking about MaxMara? The brand has a few styles it does every year. The 101801 is the double-breasted coat, the Manuela is a wrap coat, but the one I have my eye on is the Ludmilla, which is the wrap coat with an A-line silhouette. The fullness at the bottom is reminiscent of the 1950s and feels a little optimistic. It comes in black and, even better, tobacco brown. But what if you got it in the bright cornflower blue cashmere? It would look good with pretty much anything (black, navy, brown, green, pink, yellow), I promise. ($6,590)\n\nOn Christmas Eve I ended up at the Herm\u00e8s boutique in the meatpacking district, dropping off a repair. But while I was in store, I drank the free water I was given and went upstairs, where I zeroed in on this wrap coat in double-sided baby cashmere that\u2019s a shade somewhere between oatmeal and ivory. I spent a solid five minutes petting and photographing it. There\u2019s a small ring on one of the front pockets that you could attach your keys to. Would that be weird? I guess if you\u2019re walking around town in an Herm\u00e8s coat, get as weird as you want. ($8,050)\n\nI have two different friends on the hunt for oversize, super-luxe peacoats. This Ala\u00efa one has shape. In the front, it\u2019s business: just below the knees, big collar, vinyl-covered buttons. But it\u2019s a party in back with a low martingale (a sort of strap) that gives it a gathered look. It also comes in a two-button version that hits at the hips for a more classic peacoat shape. Why decide? I\u2019ll take both. ($5,050)\n\nI will not entertain queries about the practicality of white coats. If you live in a world where you buy five-figure coats, practicality should not be your concern, either. I think there\u2019s a certain point in one\u2019s fashion journey where you get really into legacy Italian brands. MaxMara may be the gateway drug, but the end point is a label like Brunello Cucinelli or Loro Piana. This coat is a silk and cashmere blend that looks almost like a tweed. If you put it on, you\u2019ll look like a Hitchcock heroine, even if you\u2019re wearing sweatpants underneath. ($10,125)\n\nThe scarf coat is a whole thing this year. I don\u2019t mean that disparagingly, just that there are a lot of potentially good ones to sort through. Toteme has a version, Tove has a version, but my favorite is from the New York label Kallmeyer. It\u2019s made in a cashmere-wool blend and \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 the attached scarf is detachable, giving you a lot of options. I would wear the scarf as a giant head wrap with a down jacket and leather pants in 18-degree weather, or wear the coats sans scarf and open with the vintage black Levi\u2019s 501s I just got on Etsy and my black Lucchese cowboy boots in 50-degree weather. ($1,575)\n\nOnce, because of a canceled connecting flight, I had an unexpected afternoon in Rome. I decided I wanted to go to the Massimo Alba store. I went on foot, got totally lost, ate a mortadella sandwich and came upon the boutique only to find it closed. I think the lesson was something about the journey being the destination. Tailored, men\u2019s-wear-inspired coats are everywhere right now, but I like Massimo Alba\u2019s Praga coat in navy the best. It has dropped shoulders that soften the look a bit. And while I\u2019m talking about softness, coats are not costumes. I see women all over my Instagram feed wearing their tailored coats with trousers and silk tops as if they\u2019re playacting at being career women from a 1990s movie. Don\u2019t do that. Wear it with whatever you normally wear. Wear it over Julia Heuer pants! ($2,635, on sale for $1,581) A column for people whose fantasy life involves a lot of shopping.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHouse Republicans are preparing a cascade of investigations, some overlapping, into the Biden administration and its policies. Right-wing lawmakers have said the ultimate goal is to impeach the president.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With Washington in a state of divided government, newly empowered House Republicans are all but certain to be unable to enact their legislative agenda into law. Instead, they have made it clear that their primary mission in the 118th Congress will be investigating the Biden administration, including inquiries they say could lead to the potential impeachment of President Biden and several cabinet members. Preparing to use their new subpoena power, Republicans have already created three special investigative committees or subcommittees, but they expect to carry out many more inquires under existing committees they now control. Some of the investigations may involve multiple panels, and top Republicans are jockeying for the biggest and most prominent pieces. While Speaker Kevin McCarthy said last year that he had not yet seen grounds for impeaching Mr. Biden, Republicans have already introduced a host of impeachment articles against the president and members of his cabinet, and some influential members on the right have said they relish the prospect of trying him for high crimes and misdemeanors. Here is a road map of the investigations: What committee is involved: A special subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio.\n\nSubstantive policy questions: This remains to be seen. The text of the resolution establishing the subcommittee gives the panel essentially open-ended jurisdiction to scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties or to examine how any agency of the federal government has collected, analyzed and used information about Americans \u2014 including \u201congoing criminal investigations.\u201d It also gives the subcommittee the authority to obtain classified information typically only provided to the Intelligence Committee, including some of the government\u2019s most protected secrets. Political agenda: During the 2022 campaign, Republicans promised to use their new power in Congress to scrutinize what they said was a concerted effort by the government to silence and punish conservatives at all levels, from protesters at school board meetings to former President Donald J. Trump. The panel could become a venue for targeting federal workers accused of carrying out a partisan agenda. It could also re-litigate revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, including the facts surrounding his effort to overturn the 2020 election or his removal of classified material from the White House, and failure to return it. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the new panel the \u201cSelect Committee on Insurrection Protection.\u201d The 118th Congress is underway, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding the Senate.\n\u2022 None A Wide-Ranging Inquiry: The House approved the The House approved the creation of a committee to scrutinize what Republicans say is the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against conservatives. Democrats and historians see dark historical parallels\n\u2022 None Abortion: As part of an anti-abortion rights effort, House Republicans pushed through a bill that could As part of an anti-abortion rights effort, House Republicans pushed through a bill that could subject doctors who perform abortions to criminal penalties\n\u2022 None I.R.S. Funds: Republicans in the House voted to Republicans in the House voted to cut funding for the Internal Revenue Service , as conservative lawmakers try to kneecap President Biden\u2019s $80 billion overhaul of the agency.\n\u2022 None Nebraska: Former Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, a Republican, Former Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, a Republican, was appointed as the state\u2019s next senator , replacing Ben Sasse, who resigned to become president of the University of Florida. What committees are involved: The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is led by Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky, and potentially the new Judiciary subcommittee. Substantive policy questions: The Oversight Committee says the purpose of its inquiry is to inform legislation to strengthen federal ethics laws and to ensure that financial institutions have the proper internal controls and compliance programs to alert federal agencies of potential money-laundering activity.\n\nPolitical agenda: Mr. Comer has pledged for months to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s family and its business connections. His staff has already obtained the contents of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, whose business activities are under federal investigation. Mr. Comer and Mr. Jordan held a news conference on Capitol Hill detailing their plans to take the inquiry\u2019s focus beyond the younger Mr. Biden. \u201cThis is an investigation of Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. Comer has said. What committees are involved: A special subcommittee of the Oversight Committee, and the Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington. Substantive policy questions: Lawmakers say they want to explore whether the U.S. government should be funding so-called gain-of-function research, a narrow sliver of scientific inquiry that can involve tinkering with viruses in a way that could make them more dangerous. Such research is at the heart of Republican assertions that the pandemic may have been caused by a laboratory leak \u2014 a suggestion disputed by scientists whose research shows the outbreak most likely originated at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Political agenda: Republicans including Mr. Comer and Mr. Jordan have asserted, without evidence, that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden\u2019s former medical adviser, covered up a lab leak that they allege may have caused the pandemic. They have said repeatedly that they will investigate Dr. Fauci, who is a political target for Republicans seeking to woo Trump voters. Dr. Fauci has said he has a \u201ccompletely open mind\u201d about whether the outbreak originated in a lab, but that the preponderance of evidence shows it was a natural occurrence.

What committee is involved: A new select committee focused on the strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese government, led by Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin. Substantive policy questions: The committee\u2019s purpose is to investigate the Chinese government\u2019s \u201ceconomic, technological and security progress, and its competition with the United States.\u201d It will examine many topics, including the economic dependence of the United States on Chinese supply chains, the nation\u2019s security assistance to Taiwan and lobbying efforts by the Chinese government to influence local and state government, as well as academic institutions. The panel will then make recommendations for how the United States can avoid being overtaken by China in those areas. Political agenda: This committee received bipartisan support and is unlikely to become as politically charged as other Republican-led investigations. Still, some Democrats worried that an intense focus on China could lead to xenophobic rhetoric intensifying anti-Asian sentiment in the United States.\n\nWhat committees are involved: The Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas; the Armed Services Committee, led by Representative Mike D. Rogers, Republican of Alabama; and the Oversight Committee. Substantive policy questions: Republicans on Mr. McCaul\u2019s committee have already released an interim report titled \u201cA Strategic Failure: Assessing the Administration\u2019s Afghanistan Withdrawal,\u201d and he plans to continue the investigation, now with subpoena power. It is expected to focus on planning in the run-up to the evacuation, botched efforts to extract Afghan interpreters and contractors who aided the U.S. government, and the consequences of the withdrawal. Political agenda: Seen as among the House Republicans\u2019 most serious investigations, the inquiry can also be used to undermine faith in the Biden administration\u2019s competency. What committees are involved: The Homeland Security Committee, led by Representative Mark E. Green, Republican of Tennessee; the Judiciary Committee; and the Oversight Committee. Substantive policy questions: Investigating the Biden administration\u2019s approach to the border will be a large focus of Republicans\u2019 efforts for the next two years, but it is yet to be determined what policy recommendations they will make. With Congress in a state of divided power, any immigration legislation is unlikely to pass. Political agenda: The investigations are aimed at countering the record-breaking surges of migration at the southern border that have strained resources as the Biden administration scrambles to address what members of both parties call a crisis. At the same time, Republicans have sought to use Mr. Biden\u2019s border policies as a political weapon against him and Democrats, blaming them for crime and capitalizing on fears among some in their hard-right base that immigrants of color will dilute their voting power. They have called for the impeachment of the homeland security secretary, Alejandro N. Mayorkas. Mr. McCarthy has said that Mr. Jordan and Mr. Comer would lead an investigation into Mr. Mayorkas to \u201cdetermine whether to begin an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nWhat committees are involved: Unclear. Most likely the Oversight Committee or the Judiciary Committee and its new subcommittee.\n\n\n\nSubstantive policy questions: In a closed-door meeting in November, right-wing lawmakers including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia extracted a promise that their leaders would investigate Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, and the Justice Department for the treatment of defendants jailed in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Ms. Greene has released a report on conditions at the D.C. jail, and local officials have acknowledged there are longstanding issues at the facility. Political agenda: The topic has been a focus for hard-right Republicans in Congress, who have tried to downplay or distort what happened during the deadly assault, saying that the real victims are the ordinary people who entered the Capitol and, they say, are being persecuted for their political beliefs. Many of them want retribution for Democrats\u2019 extensive investigation into the riot, which laid out in a series of public hearings and a voluminous report the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s plot to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election, with help from allies inside and outside Congress. But some Republicans would prefer not to focus on the topic, which would inevitably involve rehashing what happened during the assault and their roles in Mr. Trump\u2019s election subversion efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on a lot of investigations,\u201d Mr. Comer told reporters recently, adding, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d Mr. Jordan has been vague about whether he would pursue that angle in his investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on how political our Justice Department has become,\u201d he said.",

The country has endured several Ebola outbreaks over the years.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe virus spread to nine districts nationwide, infecting hundreds and killing dozens. Seven health workers were among those who died.\n\nThe World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the latest Ebola epidemic in Uganda over, closing the chapter on a deadly outbreak that lasted nearly four months and killed dozens of people. The outbreak had spread to nine districts, including the capital, Kampala, raising fears of its snowballing across the East African region. It was the worst Ebola outbreak in Uganda in more than two decades, and the second-deadliest in the country\u2019s history, with 142 confirmed cases and 55 deaths, and an additional 22 deaths also linked to the outbreak, according to the W.H.O. Seven of those who died were health workers. The W.H.O. considers an epidemic over when no confirmed or probable cases are reported for 42 days, twice the incubation period for Ebola infections. The response to the outbreak was hampered by delays in identifying and tracing the first case, along with widespread misinformation among the public about the perils and even the existence of the virus.\n\nThe authorities also initially hesitated to impose a lockdown in the epicenter of the outbreak, in central Uganda, fearing that any restrictions would adversely affect the economy and estrange a population already angry about previous strict Covid shutdowns. The outbreak was caused by the Sudan strain of the virus, which has no approved vaccine or therapeutics. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the W.H.O. regional director for Africa, said that the lack of treatment made it challenging to tackle the virus. \u201cTwo months ago, it looked as if Ebola would cast a dark shadow over the country well into 2023,\u201d Dr. Moeti said in a statement. \u201cBut this win starts off the year on a note of great hope for Africa.\u201d Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted through body contact with sick or dead people or animals. Its symptoms include fever, fatigue and headaches, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, and internal and external bleeding. The virus kills half of those it infects. The worst outbreak recorded spread across West Africa between 2014-16, followed by one in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018. While there are existing Ebola vaccines \u2014 like the injectable Ervebo vaccine that was crucial to ending the outbreak in Congo \u2014 they do not protect against the Sudan strain.\n\nUganda has suffered multiple Ebola outbreaks in the past. The worst was in 2000, killing 224 people, according to the W.H.O. The latest outbreak was first reported on Sept. 20, when a case was confirmed at a hospital in the Mubende district, about 90 miles west of Kampala. The patient, a 24-year-old male, had developed symptoms including high fever, chest pain and convulsions, along with bleeding in the eyes. He had visited multiple health facilities before he was finally isolated and tested for the virus. He died on Sept. 19. For weeks, Ugandan officials dismissed calls to issue restrictions in and beyond the epicenter of the outbreak in the central part of the country. Health experts worried about population movement and the fact that the districts where cases had been reported abutted a major highway connecting them to the capital and to the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. It was not until mid-October that President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda imposed an overnight curfew, and stopped movement in and out of Mubende and Kassanda, the two districts identified as the epicenter of the outbreak. But by then, the virus had spread nationwide, including to the capital, and to Jinja, a city on the shores of Lake Victoria. Contacts of Ebola patients were also eluding quarantine, putting more people at risk. The United States, fearing the risk of international spread, began screening air travelers who had visited Uganda. The epidemic was deemed to be under control in late November when the last patient was discharged from hospital. In mid-December, Mr. Museveni lifted the lockdown on Mubende and Kassanda, saying that his country had succeeded in keeping the virus under control.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nDuring his tenure, the nonprofit supported works that have gone on to earn seven Pulitzer Prizes and nearly 30 Tony Awards.\n\nBarry Grove was 23 years old when, in 1975, he started work as the managing director at Manhattan Theater Club, then a fledging nonprofit producing Off Off Broadway shows in space rented from a Bohemian Benevolent and Literary Association on the Upper East Side. Over nearly half a century, as the organization, the art form and the industry have expanded and transformed, he has become a familiar figure both on Broadway, where M.T.C., which primarily presents new plays, now operates the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, and Off Broadway, where the company presents work at New York City Center in Midtown. The company\u2019s annual budget has grown from $172,000 to about $27 million. Grove\u2019s longtime partnership with the company\u2019s artistic director, Lynne Meadow, who is celebrating her 50th anniversary at the nonprofit, has supported work that has won seven Pulitzer Prizes (for \u201cCost of Living,\u201d \u201cCrimes of the Heart,\u201d \u201cDoubt,\u201d \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d \u201cProof,\u201d \u201cRabbit Hole\u201d and \u201cRuined\u201d) and 28 Tony Awards. At the same time, he has taught (most recently at Columbia and Yale) and served on the industry\u2019s most powerful boards (including for the Tony Awards, the Broadway League and the League of Resident Theaters). Now M.T.C.\u2019s executive producer, Grove, 71, is ready to leave. He announced Wednesday that his last day will be June 30. His final shows include two plays on Broadway, \u201cThe Collaboration,\u201d which opened in December and runs through Feb. 5, and \u201cSummer, 1976,\u201d which begins performances April 4, as well as two Off Broadway plays, \u201cThe Best We Could\u201d and \u201cKing James.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an incredible run and an incredible relationship, and have done amazing things,\u201d Meadow said. \u201cI will miss him terribly, and we\u2019re going to continue to try to be great.\u201d As Grove prepares to depart the company, he reflected on his tenure, and the state of the industry. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Very recently it became clear to me that it was time for me to do this and have some time while I\u2019m still healthy with my wife and extended family, to maybe go back to teaching and some consulting work. I started in the professional theater when I was 19. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready to get into a rocking chair, but I do want to be able to pursue small projects, a lifelong commitment to teaching, service to the community, that kind of stuff. Why did you stay for so long? If I had just landed in a finished theater \u2014 big and mature \u2014 I might well have gotten tired or burned out much earlier. But from the beginning, I was able to adopt a strategy of \u201clearn it, do it, teach it, monitor it, and then get out of the way.\u201d And so we were able to grow a staff and to grow the institution. With each new idea Lynne had, or new opportunity that the work demanded, there was a new challenge, and it kept me interested, it kept me motivated, and it kept me moved by the power of the work. What is your favorite show that you\u2019ve worked on? This is a question over the years I\u2019ve been asked a lot, and my answer is always the same: The next one.\n\nWhat is the future of the Manhattan Theater Club? I think it\u2019s yet to be charted, but I hope that it will continue to be involved in important new work, and that it can remain a viable not-for-profit that will allow a next generation to do the work they feel needs to be and wants to be done. I\u2019m not looking to tower over the future. I full well expect they\u2019ll take the place beyond where we have and to places I haven\u2019t even maybe dreamed of. What is the state of the play on Broadway? It\u2019s now clear that we\u2019re still not out of the woods on the pandemic aftereffects. The numbers are just down. In addition, there are for the first time in a while, a number of play revivals on Broadway, with very expensive capitalizations and stars, and between them they are seating a lot of people, but many of them are going to close at a loss. And in the meantime it makes for trying to keep the audience at the same size here hard, because the commercial world is spending a lot of money advertising. And beyond that, people are still slow to come back a lot \u2014 they\u2019re buying single tickets to shows they want to see, but they\u2019re not buying large subscription packages. We\u2019re not out of the hole. How are nonprofit theaters doing? Everywhere, sales have been disrupted. I\u2019d make a plea to the general public that cares about the theater: If ever there was a time to support your local theater, whichever one that is, now is the time to do that. Will you keep seeing theater? Of course.

SACRAMENTO \u2014 The wind on the American River was blowing the rain nearly sideways. Just two nights before, a nearby tree toppled onto a woman, killing her as she slept. Through the flap of a makeshift tent, Jose Reyes, 50, peered into the whipping downpour as cold water pelted his leaky tarp and sluiced down the rusty bed frame he was using as ballast. His sleeping bag was soaked. So were his socks and pant legs. Behind him, a young woman nibbled wet Pringles, her bare feet slender and pale against the mud beneath them. Mr. Reyes \u2014 part of a homeless encampment that has occupied this stretch of parkway for years in Sacramento \u2014 said it had been days since they rested. \u201cI\u2019ve just been paying attention to the wind,\u201d he said early Monday. \u201cWondering which tree will crack next.\u201d\n\nFrom rural Sonoma County to the celebrity enclave of Montecito, a brutal parade of atmospheric rivers has tested California\u2019s infrastructure and endurance. Streets have flooded, levees have failed, mudslides have closed highways and wind gusts have knocked out electricity for days. At least 17 people have died since late December. But few have faced as stark a challenge as the more than 170,000 people who are homeless in California. The state not only has the nation\u2019s largest population of homeless residents, but unlike in colder locales, nearly 70 percent of them sleep in tents, vehicles or public open spaces. Outreach workers in recent days have found them huddling in underpasses and riverbeds, in parks and on beaches. In Ventura County, firefighters rescued at least 14 people in heavy rain on Monday when record flooding in the Ventura River engulfed a homeless encampment. In Sacramento County, officials said, at least two people \u2014 Steven Sorensen, 61, and Rebekah Rohde, 40, a member of the American River encampment \u2014 were killed outdoors in separate incidents over the weekend when huge, storm-weakened trees fell onto their tents.\n\nMatthew Z. Fowle, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who has been tracking mortality among unhoused people, said that he had sampled about half of the 50 or so large counties that record the relevant information. Between 2015 and 2020, he said, the mortality rate related to extreme heat or cold more than doubled to about 80 per 100,000 homeless people. A string of major storms in California has caused extreme flooding and damage across the state.\n\u2022 None Flood Risk: Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding could disproportionately affect Black residents\n\u2022 None Homeless Populations: Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms in a way few others did\n\u2022 None Drought: All the rain and snow All the rain and snow are undoubtedly good news for California\u2019s water supply , but they\u2019re unlikely to end the drought altogether\n\u2022 None Resilient Forests: Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees are adapted to a wide range of weather events In California, advocates for homeless people say that too many residents are forced to live on the streets because of an acute shortage of shelter space and affordable housing, even as the state funnels billions of dollars toward solving the problem. But they also blame a severe lack of mental health programs and temporary housing that would encourage more people to come indoors \u2014 and stay there. Homeless campers along the American River Parkway remain dry at most times of the year in Sacramento but encounter peril in hard rains or when melted snow rushes down from the Sierra Nevada foothills, filling reservoirs and prompting dam releases that flood low-lying encampments. Park rangers try to warn and evacuate as many homeless people as they can, though plenty insist on staying. Some say they feel unsafe in group shelters. Some have pets that they cannot bear to leave and that cannot be accommodated. Some fear exposure to Covid-19. Some do not want to leave their belongings behind, or they resent curfews and strict sobriety requirements. \u201cA lot of people in our shelter are fresh out of prison,\u201d said Steve Andert, 61, an amputee in Sacramento who had taken a break from a facility for the homeless early on Monday to watch the American River. People unaccustomed to inmates are frightened enough to want to stay away, he added.\n\nOn Monday, the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services said it had met with more than 400 representatives of community agencies and nonprofits across California to connect homeless people and other vulnerable groups with resources and shelters. Outreach workers in some cities say that the additional effort is sorely needed. \u201cThe city and the county have failed to meet people \u2014 to provide emergency shelter that actually meets people\u2019s needs,\u201d said Talya Husbands-Hankin, who runs the homeless advocacy organization Love and Justice in the Streets in Oakland, Calif. On Monday, she was handing out hot coffee, sandwiches and tarps at encampments in the city. \u201cAs a result of that, people are left to fend for themselves in extremely unsafe circumstances,\u201d Ms. Husbands-Hankin said. \u201cThe storm really exposes the bigger issue, which is that living outside without shelter is just not safe.\u201d Just outside of an Oakland encampment known as Wood Street, once among the largest in the Bay Area, debris and trash bags floated in ankle-deep waters. Residents have been evicted over the past several months and have moved onto neighboring streets, one of which is now partially flooded. Further evictions had been planned for Monday but were temporarily halted by a federal judge, who cited the severe weather in his ruling. Officials in Alameda County and the City of Oakland said that outreach teams were visiting encampments across the region. They said they had increased their number of emergency shelter beds, and that there were still some available. The city said that animal services could provide overnight shelter for pets.\n\nRamona Choyce, 44, said she had not encountered any outreach workers and that she did not believe people should be forced into shelters. \u201cWhat is shelter?\u201d she rhetorically asked as she waded through the water just outside the Wood Street encampment, sorting recyclables that she planned to sell so that she could buy propane. Ms. Choyce said that she had four dogs, and valued the private space of her R.V. \u201cI can\u2019t just give them away,\u201d she added of her pets. \u201cThey\u2019re my kids.\u201d In Los Angeles, where the newly elected mayor declared a state of emergency to address the city\u2019s homelessness crisis, advocates worried particularly about Skid Row, a fixture of homeless encampments located downtown. Among the 4,400 homeless people there, less than half identify as sheltered. \u201cMost of them have years of street life and are pretty adept at surviving on the streets, but this cold and wet weather increases the likelihood of people dying from exposure, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re all very concerned about,\u201d said Mike Arnold, the president and C.E.O. of the Midnight Mission, a long-established shelter in the area. With flash flood warnings in Los Angeles County, which has about 70,000 people who are homeless, local organizations were handing out rain gear, ponchos and even tents, which they usually do not distribute for fear that recipients will avoid seeking shelter. But a shortage of temporary beds has left limited options, a problem exacerbated by the coronavirus as well as the winding down of a state initiative that had provided hotel and motel rooms during the pandemic. The mission, which has about 270 beds and, like most shelters in the area, is close to capacity, has been trying to figure out how to quickly add temporary canopies to its outdoor courtyard to offer refuge, albeit unheated.\n\nAs California braced for the week, north to south, the race to protect people living outside raised larger questions, including the existential matter of how long the place and its people can endure the current battering. At an Oakland shelter run by Omni Commons, a community nonprofit, Cy Brown said that he decided to come inside after sleepless nights spent shivering in his drenched clothes. \u201cThat rain was really, really cold, bone-chilling rain. I couldn\u2019t find nowhere to hide,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who is in his 60s. He said he was now suffering from pneumonia and frostbite on his toes. \u201cI stayed under a tree, but it just kept pounding me,\u201d he said of the rain. On Monday morning, Mr. Brown was taking refuge along with about a dozen others inside the emergency shelter, a dimly lit ballroom where the shapes of sleeping bodies could be made out, swaddled in blankets on inflatable mattresses. Silver Zahn, a volunteer at the shelter, said that for many, the deluge had been overwhelming: \u201cWe\u2019re Californians in drought. We don\u2019t know how to respond to rain.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAt least 17 more civilians have died in extraordinary violence in Peru.\n\nDozens of people have died in southern Peru in clashes between protesters and government forces since early December, including at least 17 civilians and one police officer who were killed Monday in the city of Juliaca, near the border with Bolivia. It was part of an extraordinary spasm of violence that further complicated the new president\u2019s attempt to stabilize the country after weeks of demonstrations. The Monday killings drew widespread condemnation of the Peruvian security forces, which appeared to be responsible for most of the deaths and have been accused by protesters and human rights groups of using lethal force indiscriminately against civilians. Monday\u2019s events were the deadliest single clash between civilians and armed personnel in Peru in at least two decades, when the country emerged from a dictatorship as well as from a long and brutal fight with a violent guerrilla group, a conflict that left at least 70,000 people dead, many of them civilians. Background: After the country\u2019s leftist president, Pedro Castillo, attempted to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, he was arrested and replaced by his vice president. His supporters, many of them living in impoverished rural regions, quickly took to the streets to demand new general elections.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the head of a Russian mercenary organization known as the Wagner Group, claimed yesterday that his fighters had seized the Ukrainian town of Soledar, the recent site of brutal combat, a claim that could not be verified. If true, it would mark the first significant Russian victory in months. Earlier in the day, Britain\u2019s defense ministry said that Russian forces were probably in control of most of Soledar after four days of particularly intense fighting, with heavy casualties, against fierce Ukrainian resistance. The town had become the focal point of Russia\u2019s monthslong campaign to seize the city of Bakhmut, several miles to the southwest. The battle highlights the war\u2019s return to grinding attrition in the last two months, after a period of offensives over wide swaths of land. \u201cEverything is completely destroyed; there is almost no life left,\u201d Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said of Soledar. He asked the same question many analysts and experts were posing: \u201cWhat did Russia want to gain there?\u201d\n\nThe authorities in Brazil issued arrest warrants for two government security officials, zeroed in on people suspected of funding this week\u2019s violent protests and asked a federal court to freeze the assets of the far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, after an invasion of Brazil\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices by protesters on Sunday. The Brazilian Supreme Court justice who issued the warrants for the two security officials said that investigators had evidence that the officials had known that violence was brewing but had done nothing to stop it. He said that they were under investigation on suspicion of terrorism, criminal association and offenses related to the violent overthrow of democracy. The request to freeze Bolsonaro\u2019s assets is now in the hands of a judge, but it is unclear whether the court has the legal power to block his accounts. Freezing assets, even if it were not challenged in court, could prove a lengthy and complex process. The authorities are also expected to take action against more than 100 companies that are thought to have helped the protesters. Lula: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the president, said that he believed prominent players in the country\u2019s powerful agriculture industry had played a role in the storming of the government buildings. \u201cThese people were there today, the agribusiness,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these people will be investigated, found out, and will be punished.\u201d\n\nFacebook remade the virtual world. For a brief period, it also tried to reshape the physical one. The company hoped to make it easier for people in the Bay Area to get to work, by building a rail system that could alleviate traffic, cut down on emissions and shrink commute times for those who couldn\u2019t afford to live near their workplaces. Then it gave up. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to really benefit the region,\u201d one advocate for the rail system said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s dead.\u201d The prodigies shaping the future of Barcelona and Real Madrid: Eight outstanding young players have the talent to take the clubs into a new era. One hurdle: chemistry. How Manchester United recruits: Manchester United\u2019s scouting and recruitment network has developed hugely since the days of Alex Ferguson. Erik Ten Hag is using the framework that is in place, while adding some emphasis of his own. Gareth Bale\u2019s retirement is the end of a Wales era: Teammates, coaches and Bale\u2019s old physical education teacher reflect on his love of Wales and the remarkable impact he had on the national team. \u201cSpare,\u201d Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, is an emotional and embittered book, Alexandra Jacobs writes in her review for The Times. The entire project is mired in a paradox, she writes: Harry has drawn endless attention in his stated effort to renounce his fame. \u201cHe seems both driven mad by \u2018the buzz,\u2019\u201d she writes, \u201cand constitutionally unable to stop drumming it up.\u201d Harry is by turns raunchy, joking about a frostbitten penis and how he lost his virginity, and vindictive, detailing fights with Prince William and portraying his brother as entitled and violent, not to mention bald. And he grieves his mother, Princess Diana, with his repressed recollections unlocked by therapy and a whiff of First by Van Cleef & Arpels.\n\nThe book\u2019s publication seems likely to dash any near-term prospects that Harry will return to the fold by reconciling with his father, King Charles III; with Camilla, the queen consort; or with his older brother, Prince William, writes Mark Landler, our London bureau chief. The deepening rift could complicate Charles\u2019s coronation, planned for May. And the memoir may also finally exhaust the public\u2019s interest in the self-exiled couple, even in the U.S. Still, the ubiquitous coverage is unlikely to damage sales, at least in the short term. For more: Along with the juicy tidbits Harry offers up on his own life, there is also a revealing look at how the royal family, and its staff, operate behind closed doors.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to investigate former President Donald J. Trump, was already working 12-hour days before moving from his home in The Hague to Washington for a new job and an uncertain future. The actions Mr. Smith has taken since he began in November suggest a prosecutor on the move to resolve concurrent investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s retention of government documents and his actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol before a presidential election in which his subject is a declared candidate. He has asked prosecutors to stress-test potential charges related to Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of national security documents after he left office. He has called back key witnesses to scrutinize their accounts and present more information before the grand jury. He has pushed investigators to issue dozens of subpoenas related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And he has interviewed players in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit to try to understand his mind-set when he held onto government records, and whether people connected to him have tried to influence witnesses. But even as Mr. Smith \u2014 known to colleagues as a brisk and hard-charging prosecutor \u2014 pushes toward his goal of moving expeditiously, he faces headwinds that other special counsels have not. The challenges are unique to investigating Mr. Trump at a time when newly empowered House Republicans have established a committee responsible for investigating the investigators who they insist are targeting their party and the former president for political purposes.\n\nHis job only became more challenging this week after two disclosures that President Biden had retained classified documents from his time as vice president, which could force Attorney General Merrick B. Garland into appointing a second special counsel. Before announcing Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment, Mr. Garland knew that the president\u2019s lawyers had found the classified documents on Nov. 2. A Justice Department spokesman would not say when Mr. Smith learned about the Biden documents and declined to comment for this article. Should John R. Lausch Jr., the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Chicago assigned to review the Biden matter, recommend installing a special counsel, Mr. Smith would likely pay close attention to the outcome of that inquiry, even though it is a separate matter. Mary McCord, a former top official in the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, cautioned that the circumstances did not seem comparable based on what was publicly known so far, but she acknowledged that the Biden case could shape Mr. Smith\u2019s work. \u201cProsecutors look for cases with similar facts when making charging decisions to treat like cases comparably,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere the facts are dissimilar, that may justify dissimilar treatment.\u201d\n\nThis account of Mr. Smith\u2019s early days is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former investigators briefed on his work. Some investigators on Mr. Smith\u2019s team believe that any initial charging decisions, expected as early as this summer, will involve the investigation into whether Mr. Trump illegally kept classified materials at his Florida estate and obstructed repeated efforts to retrieve them. That case involves a more discrete set of facts than the sprawling examination into Mr. Trump\u2019s actions leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Any charges would be legally and politically fraught, as would any decision not to charge the former president. While the possible criminal violations being scrutinized in the documents investigation are relatively straightforward, it is less clear what they might be in the investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cling to power after his election loss.\n\nUnder Mr. Smith, prosecutors have subpoenaed a range of people, seeking documents that relate to vendors, lawyers and political officials affiliated with Mr. Trump, covering the period from October 2020 through September 2022, according to two people briefed on the documents. The requests indicate that the special counsel\u2019s office could be exploring how the former president and his inner circle raised and spent money: Were false election fraud claims used to raise funds? Who covered legal expenses for Mr. Trump\u2019s associates? Did money pass through to people who were not disclosed? Some of those questions hew closely to investigative leads that the Jan. 6 House committee pursued but did not present in its public hearings.\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s fast-paced approach stands in contrast to past special counsels, whose investigations have dragged on as they hired staff members, explored new leads and navigated political land mines.

Ken Starr spent four years examining a variety of allegations related to President Bill Clinton. Robert S. Mueller III investigated Russian election interference and whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct his inquiry over two years. John H. Durham has spent four years scrutinizing whether the F.B.I. and C.I.A. abused their powers when they investigated Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Many inside the Justice Department admire Mr. Smith\u2019s reputation for speed and thoroughness as a federal prosecutor, including in his trial work in the U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices in Brooklyn and Nashville and a stint in Washington holding public officials to account in corruption cases. But skeptics say that Mr. Smith\u2019s confidence in his own abilities makes him a micromanager with relentlessly high expectations, comfortable with taking risks that others might not. Critics and supporters alike say that he is drawn to the biggest and most difficult cases. For the past three and a half years, Mr. Smith has been the top war crimes prosecutor at The Hague, which last month sentenced a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army to 26 years in prison for the ethnic cleansing that took place in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. It capped one of four significant cases and two convictions that Mr. Smith supervised during his time in the Netherlands. Mr. Smith had no intention of leaving The Hague, but he could not resist the opportunity to oversee the extraordinary decision of whether to criminally prosecute a former president. Mr. Garland had not heard of Jack Smith until last year, when it became clear that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were both likely to pursue the presidency, and the question of who could do the job overshadowed his meetings with top officials.\n\nMarshall Miller, a top official under the deputy attorney general, Lisa O. Monaco, suggested Mr. Smith. They had worked together nearly 20 years earlier at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, where Mr. Smith had cut a swaggering figure. He was known for his ability to sway a jury and for his prowess as a triathlete. He did not hesitate to prosecute the New York City police officers who brutally attacked a Haitian immigrant named Abner Louima in 1997, putting him at odds with one of the city\u2019s most powerful organizations. People who had been working on the Jan. 6 investigation in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington strongly supported the suggestion. Those included Raymond N. Hulser, who had served as Mr. Smith\u2019s deputy when he led the public integrity section from 2010 to 2015, and J.P. Cooney, a longtime public corruption prosecutor in the Washington office who had worked with both men on high-profile cases against top political figures. Mr. Garland met with Mr. Smith in Washington in the fall before announcing on Nov. 18 that he would be \u201cthe right choice to complete these matters in an evenhanded and urgent manner.\u201d \u201cJack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor, who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead,\u201d Mr. Garland said. Mr. Trump and his allies have wasted little time in trying to undercut Mr. Smith, pointing to his wife\u2019s donations to President Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign and her work with Michelle Obama. Mr. Smith in fact served as the acting U.S. attorney in the middle district of Tennessee at the start of the Trump administration and told colleagues he would have remained in the role had he not been passed over for the appointment. Still, the attacks are in keeping with Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated broadsides against law enforcement, including prosecutors on the Mueller team who were registered Democrats; Mr. Mueller himself, despite being a Republican; and Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I. whose wife ran as a Democrat for Virginia State Senate.\n\nInternally, some investigators have been struck by Mr. Smith\u2019s intensity. In briefings, he is blunt and efficient. He pushes people to look for weaknesses in their assertions and to consider points of view they may have missed. His early interactions with investigators would be familiar to former colleagues, including his desire to be deeply involved in almost every aspect of an important case, which can irk senior and seasoned prosecutors. He aims to figure out how a smart defense lawyer would attack the government\u2019s strongest arguments. He meets with key witnesses to pressure-test their testimony and determine whether they can withstand the rigor of a jury trial. When prosecutors believe they have a viable case, Mr. Smith has their teammates grill them for hours to find flaws. He is known for being able to see when a case should be closed because the evidence is insufficient, a combination of skill and will that can be difficult to deploy in high-pressure matters. But Mr. Smith may not be able to counter every weakness, including blind spots on his own team. When he led the public integrity unit, the Justice Department lost a high-profile campaign finance case against John Edwards, the former Democratic presidential candidate. And a bribery case against Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, which Mr. Hulser and Mr. Cooney worked on, all but sputtered: The trial ended in a hung jury, a judge dismissed several charges, and the Justice Department ultimately withdrew the rest.

Congress later walked back the change. \u201cMembers of Congress loved her,\u201d Hilary Rosen, a public relations executive who started her career with Liz Robbins Associates, said in a phone interview. \u201cPeople think of lobbyists making members of Congress do slimy things for money, whereas Liz would give them something that would make them feel good, like foster care or unemployment insurance.\u201d\n\nOne of her first efforts, in the mid-1970s, was to win federal funds to subsidize foster care and adoption in New York City. Washington was unenthusiastic about sending money to New York \u2014 this was the era of \u201cFord to City: Drop Dead\u201d \u2014 so she arranged a coalition of like-minded governments across the country to build pressure, then argued that the funds would reduce government spending by getting children into stable homes. At a time when female lobbyists were even rarer than female members of Congress, she prowled Capitol Hill, toting accordion files stuffed with charts and presentations, making her case one representative at a time. \u201cWhenever you met with Liz, you knew that she was going to be extremely well prepared, knew the issues really well and was very passionate about it,\u201d Marty Russo, a former Democratic representative from Illinois, said in a phone interview. \u201cLiz was a rock star.\u201d For years, every summer she held a weekend-long party at her home in East Hampton, which she playfully referred to as Congressional Camp. Mr. Russo and his family were frequent attendees, along with several other members of Congress, who might find themselves chatting with some of Ms. Robbins\u2019s many friends from outside the Beltway. Paul Newman might stop by to test out a tomato sauce recipe; Alec Baldwin might be down for basketball. \u201cShe was a great convener of folks,\u201d Heather Podesta, a lobbyist, said by phone. \u201cShe knew the senators and members really well. They were friends that she liked, lived, played and worked with.\u201d\n\nMs. Robbins was especially close to Bill and Hillary Clinton, whom she and her husband, the former TV anchor Doug Johnson, met at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan. They became fast friends: Ms. Robbins went to Arkansas to help Mrs. Clinton on child care policy, and she hosted dinners for Mr. Clinton in New York, where she introduced him to potential donors for his presidential campaign. In 1996, Mrs. Clinton hosted a baby shower for Ms. Robbins at the White House, and Ms. Robbins was a top fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. After Ms. Robbins went into home hospice care in late December, the Clintons came to visit for a long dinner on Dec. 30.\n\n\u201cIf awards were given for friendship, Liz would have swept every category over the 40 years I knew her,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. \u201cWe supported each other through our experiences in parenting, politics, traveling, sharing Christmas visits, trading books, stories and adventures, which she was planning right up until the end of her life.\u201d Elizabeth Jane Robbins was born on July 8, 1946, in an elevator at New York Hospital (now Cornell Weill Medical Center). \u201cMy mother always said I was in a hurry to get where I was going, so that was perfect,\u201d she later said.\n\nHer father, Manuel Robbins, was a lawyer who worked for a variety of city agencies, including the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office under Thomas E. Dewey, and her mother, Eleanor (Landau) Robbins, worked in communications for the American Red Cross. Liz grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., studied philosophy at Wheaton College, outside of Boston, and graduated in 1968. Along with her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Robin Johnson Tokley, and a grandson. Ms. Robbins worked in advertising in New York and spent a stint in Washington, working for several congressional committees. She returned to New York to join a new city program centered on childhood development. She didn\u2019t intend to go back to Washington. But she soon realized that the financially constrained city could do even more by accessing federal funds; it just had to ask. And she knew the right way to ask. \u201cThey went broke and sent me back to Washington to do some lobbying,\u201d Ms. Robbins told the Washington newspaper Roll Call in 2005. \u201cAnd so a lot of broke places started calling me up.\u201d By 1981 she was lobbying for San Francisco, Berkeley and the state of Michigan, as well as New York City. Though she was a Democrat, she worked both parties and developed relationships with top Republican senators. During tough negotiations over a child care bill with Bob Packwood of Oregon, he challenged her to a game of gin rummy. She won $12, and his vote. \u201cShe was like a snapping turtle; she wasn\u2019t going to let go,\u201d George Miller, a former Democratic representative from California, said in an interview. \u201cOne thing you learned about Lizzie, she was not going away.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nYou Can Do This 10-Minute Workout at Home With No Equipment\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an athlete to face daily athletic challenges. Whether it\u2019s lifting your luggage into the overhead compartment of an airplane or squatting on the floor to play with your kids, many daily movements require a combination of strength, stability and flexibility.\n\n\n\nLike an athlete, if you want to do these things well without risking injury, you have to train. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week, and two weekly sessions of strength training that target all the major muscle groups. But life is busy. If you only have 10 minutes, there\u2019s still a lot you can do, using just your body weight, that can ward off creaky knees, stiff backs and aching necks. One way to create a fast and effective workout is to focus on the concept of mobility, which involves increasing strength, stability and flexibility, said Cedric Bryant, the president of the American Council on Exercise. \u201cWhen we think of mobility, we think about movement,\u201d he said. This means strength training using dynamic moves, like lunges, that work groups of muscles, rather than individual ones, like, say, a bicep curl.\n\n\u201cThe body never does just a bicep curl\u201d in daily life, said Jessica Valant, a physical therapist and Pilates instructor based in Denver. Another way to build strength for everyday life is to do exercises that target important moving body parts, like the shoulders, hips and spine, by strengthening them while going through their ranges of motion. \u201cYour spine is the center of your torso, the hip is what connects your legs to your torso, and the shoulder is what connects your arms to your torso,\u201d Ms. Valant said. \u201cThese are the main areas that you use to reach and lift and pull. If you can work to keep those mobile, you are going to help yourself with 90 percent of the activities that you do every day.\u201d Mark Lauren, a fitness expert and former trainer for the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, said that in his own fitness routine, he methodically exercises the shoulders, spine, hips and legs, incorporating the full movement of each joint. This lets him work out quickly and efficiently to build strength and mobility. If you are actively working to develop a full range of motion for these body parts, he said, \u201ceverything else tends to take care of itself.\u201d\n\nTo create the most efficient body weight routine for increased strength and mobility in everyday life, we talked with experts about what exercises they recommend and why. The five exercises they settled on build full-body strength and will leave you feeling more capable and agile. This workout targets the hips, shoulders and spine, starting at the bottom and working up. You can also mix them up if you prefer. Take breaks as needed, but try to work up to the point where you don\u2019t need them. As you progress, you can also add light weights, but focus on mastering the movements first. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the time to feel safe and strong, that\u2019s when problems can occur later,\u201d Ms. Valant said. Start by jogging, marching in place or other dynamic warm-ups, then do two one-minute rounds of the following exercises:\n\u2022 None Pointers: six to 10 reps per minute\n\u2022 None Y-T-W-L formation: three to five reps per position, with five positions per minute Squats and lunges are the best exercises for improving hip mobility. They strengthen your legs, hips and spine, and develop your hips\u2019 range of motion. Although the exercises are similar, Ms. Valant said, it\u2019s important to do both. Squats, which target the glutes and quads, will help you get down on the ground and back up with ease. \u201cWe were made to do these deep squats,\u201d Ms. Valant said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the pelvic floor, it\u2019s good for the hips.\u201d Squats also work the body evenly, with both legs doing the same motion.\n\nLunges, on the other hand, are asymmetrical, requiring balance and stability, and cover many other daily movements. \u201cThat\u2019s how we live,\u201d Ms. Valant said, with one foot often in front of the other or out to the side. Lunges target the glutes, quads and hamstrings, which help with hiking and climbing stairs, but also build balance and sure-footedness. For lunges, take a wide stance, with the back heel lifted. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to use the counter or a chair when you\u2019re just starting,\u201d she said. For both squats and lunges, as you progress, you can start to add some weights, but when it comes to improving mobility, \u201cdeeper is better,\u201d she added. Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions of each.\n\u2022 None Squats: 10 to 20 reps per one-minute set, for a total of two sets\n\u2022 None Lunges: 10 to 20 reps per one-minute set, for a total of two sets Move the spine with pointers and bridges. The spine is unique in that it is made up of many small joints, all of which need to stay mobile in order to operate properly. The major movements of the spine are forward, backward, side to side and twisting \u2014 so those are the movements you should train. Mr. Lauren recommended pointers, which move the spine forward, backward and from side to side. Get on your hands and knees in a crawling position, fully extending your right arm and left leg out, just as you would in a bird-dog exercise. Then bring the arm and leg into the center of your body, trying to touch your right elbow to your left knee. Repeat that, using the left arm and right leg.\n\u2022 None Pointers: 6 to 10 reps per one-minute set, for a total of two sets\n\u2022 None Glute bridges: 10 to 15 reps per one-minute set, for a total of two sets Strengthen the shoulders with their four primary movements. Our shoulders are capable of a broad range of motion. To develop and maintain strong, agile shoulders, Dr. Bryant recommended the Y-T-W-L formation, which takes the shoulders through their full, three-dimensional range of motion, in four separate movements, and works to build muscles that are crucial to everyday life but are often overlooked. This exercise can be done either lying down, if you\u2019re a beginner, or in a bent-over position. The goal is to move the arms and shoulders through four movements that mimic the four letters, doing three to five reps for each. As you progress, you can add in light weights, but the focus should be on moving the shoulders fully.\n\nFor the L position, hold your arms out to your side in a similar bent position so the two arms form the shape of an L. But this time, move the forearms down in a half-circle motion to the hips, keeping the upper arm stationary.\n\u2022 None Y-T-W-L formation: three to five reps per conformation, per one-minute set, for a total of two sets Ten minutes may not seem like much for a strengthening routine. But when it\u2019s done well, with the goal of increasing overall mobility, it will make everyday movements, whether squatting to pull weeds or lifting heavy groceries out of the car, easier.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAfter pounding rains that flooded roads and brought down hillsides and trees, the state is catching its breath during a short dry spell.\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 The rains eased in California on Wednesday, offering the state a brief reprieve after nearly two weeks of downpours \u2014 and a chance to recover and prepare before another round of storms expected over the weekend. A series of atmospheric rivers, channels of battering rains, led to flash floods and mudslides across the state. The storms had killed 18 people as of Wednesday, state officials said. More than 4.5 million people, mostly in the central and northern parts of the state, were still under flood watches early Wednesday as swollen rivers and creeks continued to spill over. More bands of rain were brewing over the Pacific Ocean. A new wave of atmospheric rivers is expected to arrive starting on Friday. Parts of California and the Pacific Northwest could expect rainfall to remain in the forecast into early next week, the Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service said on Wednesday, although it should be less intense than the recent storms.\n\nThe break in the weather sent cleanup crews scrambling throughout California\u2019s capital city of Sacramento, restoring power and clearing waterlogged intersections. The morning air buzzed with the sounds of leaf blowers and chain saws. The intermission helped state crews make it into the most affected areas, said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. But he added that officials had been unnerved by what they found: Many areas, particularly in Central California, are at serious risk of landslides, flooding and debris flows. \u201cThey just have so much water \u2014 on the ground, in the soil and in the rivers and creeks \u2014 that the new storms approaching, even if they\u2019re not as powerful, could be even more devastating,\u201d he said. A string of major storms in California has caused extreme flooding and damage across the state.\n\u2022 None Flood Risk: Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding Southern California has escaped the worst of recent rainstorms, but a new study shows that severe flooding could disproportionately affect Black residents\n\u2022 None Homeless Populations: Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms Most homeless people in California live on the streets, in cars and along rivers. They experienced the long stretch of fierce storms in a way few others did\n\u2022 None Drought: All the rain and snow All the rain and snow are undoubtedly good news for California\u2019s water supply , but they\u2019re unlikely to end the drought altogether\n\u2022 None Resilient Forests: Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees Though some may be toppled in storms, California\u2019s iconic redwood trees are adapted to a wide range of weather events In Merced, in Central California, the rains have begun to abate after hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes because of flooding this week. The city put out a call for volunteers to help people in need, said Jennifer Flachman, the city\u2019s public information officer; by Wednesday, hundreds of residents had offered aid and donations.\n\nAfter days of constant chaos, the calls for urgent rescue were slowing down by Wednesday afternoon, said Scott Safechuck, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. \u201cThe rain stops and the water starts to recede, and we can see what damage is out there,\u201d he said, adding that officials were now working to clean debris and clear roadways before the next band of rain. In Southern California, blue skies and a bright day offered the clearest view yet of damage around the region, much of which occurred overnight. In the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, the beeping of loaders and the acrid smell of tires against the pavement punctuated an otherwise still and sunny morning. Public works crews arrived around 6 a.m. Wednesday to shovel mud out from under the cars that had been mired along Fredonia Drive, their boots slipping and squelching in the thick sludge that still stood a few feet high in some areas. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the best we can,\u201d said Marcos Andrade, 49, adding that it was not clear how long it might take to finish freeing and towing the last eight cars. Mr. Andrade said the crews would try to push on, but that once night fell, the hillside area would be too dangerous. Much of the land across the state is still sopping, and thousands of trees have been knocked to the ground \u2014 a product of downpours entering the soil and making it easier for strong winds to topple everything from fresh saplings to a 275-year-old oak, crushing houses and cars, snarling traffic and claiming at least three lives, including that of a 2-year-old child.\n\nMany of those killed by the storms had been trapped in cars on flooded roadways, and officials say the death toll could still rise. Divers on Wednesday found the body of a woman in Sonoma County whose car was trapped under as much as 10 feet of water the day before. And rescuers were still searching for Kyle Doan, a 5-year-old boy who was pulled from his mother\u2019s arms and swept away by floodwaters in San Luis Obispo County on Monday. On Wednesday evening, the California National Guard announced that the agency was helping the county Sheriff\u2019s Department with the search, and had already sent over 100 members to the area. The storms have also posed a danger to the more than 170,000 people who are homeless in California, more than in any other state. Outreach workers have found them in recent days huddling in underpasses and riverbeds, in parks and on beaches. Two homeless people were among those killed by fallen trees. State transportation officials reported dozens of road closures on Wednesday morning, stretching from Siskiyou County on the state\u2019s northern edge to Orange County in the south.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s efforts to limit discord over its sudden \u201czero Covid\u201d pivot are being challenged with increasing rancor, including from its own supporters.\n\nA furious, wide-ranging argument is unfolding on the internet in China over the reversal of the government\u2019s strict pandemic policies and the massive Covid surge that followed. The divisions are challenging the Communist Party\u2019s efforts to control the narrative around its pandemic pivot. Since the party abandoned \u201czero Covid\u201d last month, many online commenters have staked out opposing positions over seemingly all manner of questions. Who should be blamed for the explosion of cases and deaths? Is a top government-appointed health expert trustworthy? Is Omicron really less severe, as Chinese officials now say, when hospitals seem to be filling up with sick patients? They are even arguing over whether people should be allowed to set off fireworks during the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, after many did so during the New Year. The digital finger-pointing reveals a country that is deeply polarized, with each side distrustful and skeptical of the other \u2014 and, to varying degrees, of the party and its proxies. In some cases, the party\u2019s own supporters are indirectly questioning its decisions, complicating efforts by the party\u2019s censors and propaganda outlets to push its messaging.\n\nIf Beijing moves too hard to quash discord, it could further alienate many who had long defended \u201czero Covid\u201d and who have been confused or disappointed by the sudden policy U-turn. But if it lets the arguments escalate, it risks muddying its message and seeding more uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s very damaging for Chinese society if society is divided into very antagonistic groups \u2014 who are equally powerless, equally helpless \u2014 and they accuse each other,\u201d said Xiang Biao, a Germany-based expert on social issues in China. The Chinese government cast aside its restrictive \u201czero Covid\u201d policy, which had set off mass protests that were a rare challenge to Communist Party leadership.\n\u2022 None Rapid Spread: Since China abandoned its strict Covid rules, the intensity and magnitude of the country\u2019s outbreak has Since China abandoned its strict Covid rules, the intensity and magnitude of the country\u2019s outbreak has remained largely a mystery .

Now, the rapid spread of the virus after a chaotic reopening has Years of Covid lockdowns took a brutal toll on Chinese businesses. Now, the rapid spread of the virus after a chaotic reopening has deprived them of workers and customers By far, the more vocal side is made up of those who supported \u201czero Covid\u201d \u2014 a mix of nationalist online influencers, conservative academics, and a number of trolls. Some saw the stringent policy as necessary to save lives in a country where medical services are uneven. Others adopted the party\u2019s argument that \u201czero Covid\u201d was a measure of China\u2019s superior political model. Some voices in the so-called \u201czero Covid faction\u201d have sought to blame the protesters opposed to lockdowns for the current outbreak and rising deaths, even though the virus had been spreading wildly before the policy U-turn. They call those who supported the end of \u201czero Covid\u201d \u201ctangfei,\u201d or \u201clying flat bandits,\u201d an insulting variation of \u201clying flat,\u201d a term used to refer to a slacker lifestyle that had earlier been co-opted by Chinese state media to criticize Western approaches to coexisting with Covid.\n\nImplied in some of the criticism is that by undoing \u201czero Covid,\u201d the party has empowered its detractors at home and in the West, and weakened its position even among its own loyalists. For a time, online influencers such as Sima Nan, a nationalist, even took to denigrating government-appointed experts such as Zhang Wenhong, a top epidemiologist in Shanghai who had argued against excessive lockdowns, suggesting that Dr. Zhang had misled the public about the severity of Omicron. The vitriol was so great that state media outlets soon called for such personal attacks to stop.\n\nOn the other side are those who have welcomed the resumption of school, work, business and travel as not merely a relief from lockdowns but a much-needed retreat by the Communist Party from everyday life. Many identify themselves as part of the \u201copening up\u201d or \u201clift lockdowns\u201d faction associated with the university students, migrant workers, residents and small-business owners who protested against \u201czero Covid\u201d in November. Even Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s top leader, made a rare acknowledgment of the public disagreements, saying in a New Year\u2019s address: \u201cIt is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue.\u201d He emphasized, though, that he expected Chinese people to fall in line, and to \u201cthink in one direction, work in one direction. The strength of tomorrow\u2019s China comes from unity,\u201d he said. For much of the past three years, Mr. Xi had brooked no opposition, brandishing the \u201czero Covid\u201d policy as proof of the authoritarian party\u2019s superiority in protecting people over that of chaotic Western democracies. Now, along with a mounting public health crisis, the authorities find themselves having to rein in their own usual defenders, those who had helped prop up \u201czero Covid\u201d as the only way forward.\n\nTao Siliang, a member of China\u2019s Communist elite, recently criticized Sima Nan\u2019s attacks for contradicting the party\u2019s new direction. On Thursday, Weibo, a social media site, moved quickly to shut down or suspend more than 1,000 accounts, including that of a prominent nationalist, Kong Qingdong, for waging personal attacks against experts and scholars. \u201cAt this moment, what we need most is to abide by the 44-year-old parable: \u2018Look forward in unity,\u2019 do not challenge, tear apart, especially denounce or abuse,\u201d the official newspaper of Zhejiang Province, in China\u2019s east, wrote in a recent editorial. But some \u201czero Covid\u201d defenders, apparently disillusioned by the turn of events, rejected the call for conformity. \u201cPlease tell me, why do I have to unite?\u201d read a post that was liked 30,000 times and was written by a blogger on Weibo who described losing an uncle to complications caused by Covid. \u201cOn what basis should I be forced to accept the lone societal argument that everything is going great?\u201d Some see the opposition to reopening as mostly posturing by online personalities interested in attracting more followers, and predict that the anger will blow over once outbreaks peak and pass, and the economy recovers. To Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, the online backlash is a sign of a deeper challenge to Beijing. Mr. Xi\u2019s New Year address, he said, was a \u201crare recognition that he is facing objections, criticism and dissatisfaction inside and outside the party.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Wu said, Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d policy of top-down control pushed people to question the party\u2019s authoritarian approach, fanning a new political fervor that could, over time, gain momentum. \u201cIn some ways, if you look at things from the vantage point of the future, the current \u2018lying flat\u2019 faction is a broad foundation for a future Chinese opposition party,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\n\nIf there is one issue that both sides seem to agree on, it is that the government is hurting its credibility by not providing reliable data on the extent of Covid outbreaks and deaths across the country. The official Covid death toll is widely ridiculed on Chinese social media as absurdly low. The World Health Organization and several countries have urged Beijing to share more data on hospitalizations and deaths. The information vacuum has fueled speculation by influencers and bloggers who have pushed their own conclusions and conspiracies around the policy pivot. A key factor in the mutual infighting was the \u201ccollapse of public trust,\u201d said Mr. Xiang of Oxford, who is also the director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany. \u201cGovernment data, policies and experts\u2019 opinion lost credibility.\u201d In a recent post on social media, Hu Xijin, the nationalist former editor of the Communist Party newspaper, Global Times, suggested that the party could afford to be more open to debate. \u201cOur society can have problems and difficulties, but there should not be too many things deemed \u2018sensitive,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn other words, this country is very trustworthy and has the internal motivation to correct mistakes. \u2018Sensitivity\u2019 should not belong to China.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nPreying on shoppers strapped for cash and time, scammers are setting up fake sites that claim to have deep discounts on premium brands.\n\nThe online retailer Bombas sells socks that are durable, popular and pricey. One pair of women\u2019s ankle socks, for instance, can go for $15. So when Stephanie Lee, a 36-year-old mother of three from Seaford, Va., was alerted to a Bombas sale on the day after Christmas, she jumped at it. Her mother had sent her a Facebook message showing an ad for Bombas socks that were 53 percent off. When Ms. Lee clicked on the ad, she was sent to a page that had all the trappings of the company\u2019s website, including a heading advertising \u201cfree shipping.\u201d \u201cOf course they\u2019re going to be discounting things right after Christmas because they are getting ready for the next season,\u201d Ms. Lee said she recalled thinking. She snagged a pair for her husband, a sock bag for the washer and a six-pack of Disney Princess-themed socks, perfect for her and her mother to wear while running the Disney Princess Half Marathon next month. Her total came to $116, and she entered her husband\u2019s credit card information to pay. (The Disney socks alone usually cost $120). But Ms. Lee became suspicious when a confirmation email did not arrive in her inbox right away as it normally did when she ordered from Bombas.\n\nMs. Lee is just one of many shoppers lured in by a phony site peddling another company\u2019s merchandise. It\u2019s a problem increasingly confounding companies like Bombas, whose business model depends on advertising online and generating traffic through social media channels. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total game of whack-a-mole,\u201d said Dave Heath, the chief executive of Bombas, which has taken a proactive approach to rooting out fake sites that purport to sell its products. \u201cThe second that we report a site and it gets blocked on one of the social media channels or blacklisted, they just spin up another instance and then there\u2019s ads running almost kind of instantly.\u201d Online scams, which have existed for as long as things have been sold on the internet, are adapting to the budget-conscious behaviors of American consumers. Shoppers held out for bargains during the holiday season, knowing that stores, needing to get rid of inventory and worried about slowing sales, were more likely to offer them. That dynamic has created a ripe environment for fake sites to dupe unassuming shoppers who are strapped for cash and time by claiming to offer deep discounts on premium brands. \u201cIt\u2019s playing on the emotion of the consumer,\u201d said Douglas LaGore, a principal in KPMG\u2019s cybersecurity services division.\n\nImpostor sites often use the same tactics as retailers, like paid search optimization tools, mobile apps and advertising strategies to generate traffic, said Rick Farnell, chief executive of Tracer, which uses artificial intelligence to identify potential cases of fraud through text and images. Tracer has taken down as many as 20,000 fake sites in a month for a client, he said.\n\u2022 None Layoffs: Some of the biggest tech companies, including Some of the biggest tech companies, including Alphabet and Microsoft , have recently announced tens of thousands of job cuts .

About 35 percent of Tracer\u2019s clients are retailers. Among them is Rothy\u2019s, the women\u2019s shoe brand known for its ballet flats. Rothy\u2019s also works with Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, and using tips from customers on Facebook who flag fake ads, said it now deals with about a few dozen impostor sites per month. Toward the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021, Rothy\u2019s was \u201ceasily dealing with hundreds of fake websites per month,\u201d Zo\u00eb Richards, a company spokeswoman, said. The Better Business Bureau said the number of online scams in general has risen 87 percent since it began tracking them in 2015. Of all online scams, retail-related ones are considered the most harmful in terms of the likelihood that a victim will lose money and the median amount of money at stake. They make up about a third of all scams, and 72 percent of people lose money when targeted, according to an October report from the bureau. Nearly a quarter of the victims of online fraud said they were roped in by the offer of a great price. As economic concerns weigh on many customers, some are more inclined to choose smaller sites that promise better prices over name-brand sites. Stacie Odeneal, a 43-year-old child-welfare lawyer in Lawrenceburg, Tenn., and mother of three, does most of her shopping on Instagram and Facebook because she finds it convenient. Late on the night of Thanksgiving, she came across a Facebook ad offering discounts on Bombas socks. She had heard good things about the brand, and she wanted to hurry and buy before the sale disappeared. But when she saw an unfamiliar charge on her credit card from a company that appeared to be based in Asia, she knew something was wrong. She soon learned that a neighbor had made a similar purchase, and they realized they had been duped. When she went to report the fake ad to Facebook, she stumbled across even more of them. \u201cI felt a sense of awareness that it\u2019s easier than ever to fall prey to disingenuous people or companies seeking to capitalize on folks,\u201d Ms. Odeneal said. Mr. Heath said he thought Bombas was often targeted by scammers because it is a large online retailer, the decision to purchase socks online is often made quickly and much of the company\u2019s marketing is done on social media. For e-commerce retailers, especially those that rely on customers coming to them through ads on social media, dealing with these sites can feel like a never-ending task. As soon as one site is flagged and shut down, another one pops up promising a new, eye-popping discount. In 2022, Bombas documented more than 9,000 instances in which customers encountered impostor sites, said Mr. Heath, the chief executive. It found 900 different sites claiming to be Bombas, many of them offering discounts. Some of the fake sites completely mirror Bombas. In at least one instance, an impostor site for the luxury brand Paul Smith listed marked-down copycat Bombas socks. On TikTok, an account called @BOMBASS pushed a 50 percent discount for Cyber Monday. Some shoppers have received texts about flash sales with discounts of 80 percent. The steepest discount Bombas offers is 25 percent off, and it runs one promotion from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Mr. Heath said. To try to tamp down on the fraud, Bombas has trained workers in its customer service department on how to advise affected shoppers. The company sometimes sends duped customers a free pair of socks, as it did for Ms. Lee, who wrote a long email to Bombas explaining why she thought the fraudulent site was real. \u201cWe\u2019re really at the mercy of the technology companies that we\u2019re advertising on because they\u2019re the ones who kind of can control the flow of whether the sites get posted,\u201d Mr. Heath said. Meta said that it takes the threat of scams seriously, removing any offending ads when it finds them. \u201cWe\u2019ve created tools that people can use to report suspicious businesses, ads and product listings on Facebook and Instagram, as that information can help us improve our ability to combat fraudulent activity on our platforms,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. TikTok said that advertising needed to pass through \u201cmultiple levels of verification\u201d before being approved. \u201cWe have measures in place to detect and remove fraudulent ads,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe regularly review and improve our policies and processes in order to combat increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts and further improve the experience for our community.\u201d But customers remain vulnerable. After Jill Winkky, 56, realized she had ordered from a site called socksalevip.com instead of the official Bombas site, she spent about 15 minutes a day for a month trying to get her money back. She had spent $224 on 34 pairs of socks for herself and her sons \u2014 about what she would earn officiating three swim meets, one of several jobs she has. She sent an email to a customer service address, but the person who responded kept sidestepping her request for a refund.

She sent it back to the post office unopened, hoping she might get her money back. \u201cI really wish I could have talked to Facebook and said, \u2018Why do you let these people do this?\u2019\u201d Ms. Winkky said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Bombas.

            "description": "Once a taboo idea thought too dangerous to research, geoengineering is becoming more mainstream.",
            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThis article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Wednesdays. Last month, a two-person start-up company by the name of Make Sunsets claimed that it had launched weather balloons filled with reflective sulfur particles into the sky somewhere over the coast of Baja California. More provocation than experiment, the launch was a first-of-its-kind field test of a climate intervention known as geoengineering: a branch of speculative technology that promises to counteract and even reverse global warming by altering Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Long a taboo idea among climate experts thought too dangerous even to research, geoengineering is becoming increasingly mainstream. In 2019, Congress gave the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration $4 million to research techniques like the one Make Sunsets just tested, and it has since drawn interest from the Biden administration. As the world continues to fall short of the goals of the Paris agreement and the costs of climate change mount, is geoengineering an idea worth taking seriously, or is it a world-historically reckless distraction from the global effort to transition away from fossil fuels? Here\u2019s a look at the debate. How cooling the planet became a serious proposition In 1965, a group of scientific advisers delivered the first government report on global warming to President Lyndon Johnson. Warning of calamitous sea level rise, they called for exploring \u201cthe possibilities of deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes,\u201d perhaps by brightening the oceans\u2019 surface.\n\nProposals for geoengineering have since evolved, and fall into two broad categories: Carbon dioxide removal. In recent years, a handful of companies have debuted machines capable of extracting carbon dioxide from the air for underground storage or use in products that contain the compound, a process called direct air capture. Other strategies for carbon removal include planting trees, fertilizing the oceans with iron to stimulate phytoplankton blooms and raising the pH of the oceans to increase their absorption of carbon dioxide and counteract the acidification that threatens marine ecosystems. Solar radiation management. In 1991, a volcano in the Philippines spewed 20 million tons of sun-blocking sulfur dioxide gas into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to temporarily drop by about one degree Fahrenheit. This natural experiment provided the basis for the most well-known and controversial method of geoengineering, known as stratospheric aerosol injection. Other solar geoengineering proposals involve brightening marine clouds with sea salt, thinning a specific type of cloud that absorbs heat and, more far-fetched, shooting giant mirrors or reflective bubbles into space. Carbon removal through direct air capture is typically considered a safe and elegant form of geoengineering, but the technology is nascent, inherently slow and prohibitively expensive. For those reasons, even its supporters argue that it is best thought of as a potential way to offset the emissions from the few industries that are hard to decarbonize, like aviation. Sulfur aerosol injection, on the other hand, would be relatively easy and cheap to deploy immediately at a planetary scale, costing as little as $2 billion per year. Almost no proponents of geoengineering research champion it as a substitute for transitioning away from fossil fuels. Rather, they argue that it could help buy humanity more time to make that transition. They also point out that because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years, eliminating carbon emissions would only prevent the world from heating up further; it wouldn\u2019t cool the world back down, at least not for anyone alive today. Even if the world managed to decarbonize by 2050, extreme weather events and sea level rise would pose a greater threat than they do now for many centuries to come. \u201cEmissions cuts are necessary,\u201d David Keith, a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard, wrote in The Times in 2021. \u201cBut pretending that climate change can be solved with emissions cuts alone is a dangerous fantasy. If you want to reduce risks from the emissions already in the atmosphere \u2014 whether that\u2019s to prevent forest fires in Algeria, heat waves in British Columbia or floods in Germany \u2014 you must look to carbon removal, solar geoengineering and local adaptation.\u201d\n\nIf you find the prospect of experimenting on the atmosphere horrifying to contemplate, you\u2019re not alone. Since last January, more than 360 climate and governance scholars have signed an open letter calling on national governments and the United Nations to restrict the development of solar engineering technology, contending that it poses an \u201cunacceptable risk,\u201d for three key reasons: The side effects are too dangerous. Spraying sulfur into the stratosphere might bring down the earth\u2019s temperature, but it could also turn the sky white, change weather patterns, increase the spread of malaria, deplete the ozone layer and alter the light that plants need to grow. Some regions might suffer while others benefit, creating the potential for conflict. \u201cImagine if India started pumping sulfur into the atmosphere only to see a huge drought hit Pakistan,\u201d Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker last year. \u201cTwo nuclear powers, already at odds, with one convinced the other is harming its people.\u201d It\u2019s a false hope. Skeptics of geoengineering warn that it could detract from efforts to transition away from fossil fuels if it were inaccurately perceived as an insurance policy against climate change. Individuals might put off taking steps to reduce their carbon footprints, for example. More concerning, parties with a large stake in the fossil fuel industry might lobby for pumping sulfur into the air as an alternative to keeping oil and gas in the ground. Make Sunsets, the start-up, is already selling \u201ccooling credits\u201d as carbon offsets. \u201cSoon everyone who is dependent on coal, oil and gas will jump on the solar engineering bandwagon and say, \u2018We can continue for 40 years with fossil fuels\u2019 now,\u201d Frank Biermann, a political scientist at Utrecht University, told The Guardian last month. \u201cThis debate threatens to derail current climate policies. It\u2019s a huge risk.\u201d That risk stems in part from the fact that the cooling effect of sulfur lasts for only about one to two years. If humanity became dependent on aerosol injection as a substitute for decarbonization rather than a complement, it could become a kind of civilizational addiction, impossible to safely stop. \u201cIt would have to be continued without fail year after year, for 1,000 years or more \u2014 lest the termination shock from cessation of the intervention unleash pent-up global warming that would fry the planet in a matter of decades,\u201d wrote Raymond Pierrehumbert, an Oxford physicist, in 2020. \u201cThe disastrous consequences of termination shock would grow as we cower year after year under the flimsy stratospheric sunshade, hoping that technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere on a massive scale becomes practical before disaster strikes.\u201d\n\nWhy the geoengineering debate is heating up Proponents of solar geoengineering research often discuss the technology as an inevitability: Global warming may reach a point where the world becomes desperate enough to try blocking the sun with sulfur \u2014 and given how cheap it would be, relatively speaking, a rogue country (or billionaire) just might do so unilaterally, with or without knowledge of the potential consequences. Some countries, particularly less developed and low-lying ones, may be closer to crossing that theoretical threshold than others. \u201cGeoengineering as a possible solution to this catastrophe will definitely become the only option of last resort if we as a global community continue on the path we have been going,\u201d Anote Tong, a former president of Kiribati, a Pacific island nation on the front lines of sea level rise, told The New Yorker. \u201cThere will be a point when it has to be either geoengineering or total destruction.\u201d In 2019, a survey of international climate policy negotiators found that support for geoengineering was higher among respondents who expected severe climate change damages in their home country. If that relationship persists as the world warms, calls for more research, at least, may become louder and more difficult to defy. \u201cNo scientist is happy about the prospect of solar geoengineering,\u201d Holly Jean Buck, a professor of environment and sustainability at the University at Buffalo, wrote in MIT Technology Review last year. \u201cBut we are going to need a pipeline of thoughtful, experienced people who understand both the science and the governance issues. If we disincentivize people from developing that expertise, we may not like the results.\u201d There are signs that the geoengineering research taboo is already fading. In 2021, the influential National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued a report urging the U.S. government to spend between $100 million and $200 million to research solar geoengineering.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWhile 20 hard-right members of the U.S. House of Representatives held the national Republican leadership hostage in Washington last week \u2014 forcing concession after concession \u2014 something very different was taking place in the Republican-controlled South Carolina House of Representatives. In this former Confederate state, where Republicans hold 88 of 124 seats in the House of Representatives, the party\u2019s contemporary mainstream has faced challenges from the party\u2019s hard right similar to those that plagued congressional Republicans throughout the tenure of Speakers John Boehner, Paul Ryan and now Kevin McCarthy. Instead of acceding to the hard right, though, South Carolina Republicans turned the tables and demanded that the 19 members of the South Carolina Freedom Caucus abide by a set of rules prohibiting them from campaigning against fellow Republican incumbents or violating the confidentiality of discussions among closed meetings of Republicans. Refusal to sign on to the rules, which Freedom Caucus members have attacked as a loyalty oath, would prohibit Republicans in the state House from membership in the South Carolina Republican Caucus, effectively relegating them to legislative marginalization. So far, 71 Republicans have signed the rules, and 17 have not, according to sources who attended a closed state Republican Caucus session on Tuesday.\n\nThe intraparty conflict has remained largely out of public view in South Carolina except for coverage in a conservative web-based publication, FITSNews, run by Will Folks. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d Folks wrote in a story published on Monday, \u201cSupermajority Blues: SCGOP \u2018Oath\u2019 Standoff Is at Hand\u201d: \u201cThis \u2018loyalty oath\u2019 is about nothing more than silencing those members of the legislature who want things to change.\u201d The loyalty oath, Folks went on, would prohibit members from endorsing or campaigning on behalf of anyone challenging a G.O.P. incumbent in next spring\u2019s primary elections. It would also prohibit lawmakers from posting images of the House\u2019s electronic voting board on their social media pages \u2014 and from discussing the \u201cinternal processes\u201d behind House votes during public appearances. Basically it\u2019s an incumbent protection ultimatum \u2014 accompanied by a muzzle. Ohio provides a second example of an intraparty battle, with a different but parallel resolution. At the start of this year, Derek Merrin \u2014 a hard-edged anti-abortion conservative supportive of so-called right-to-work laws \u2014 was assured victory in his bid to become speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. Merrin had won majority support from the 67-member Republican caucus in the 99-member Ohio House. His ascent would have marked a significant shift to the right in a state Republican Party known traditionally for its centrism. On Jan. 3, however, when the full Ohio House met to pick a speaker, Merrin was defeated by a bipartisan coalition of 32 Democrats and 22 Republicans, a rarity in this polarized era. The coalition supported a less conservative, less confrontational Republican, Jason Stevens, who told the House after his victory, \u201cI pledge to respect and to work with each and every one of us to address the many concerns of our state.\u201d Let\u2019s look at a third state, Pennsylvania \u2014 where the determination of control in the state House of Representatives awaits the results of special elections for three vacancies. Here, enough Republicans joined with Democrats in a bipartisan vote on Jan. 3 to make Mark Rozzi, a centrist Democrat, speaker of the House.\n\n\u201cThe commonwealth that is home to Independence Hall will now be home to this commonwealth\u2019s first independent speaker of the House,\u201d Rozzi told his colleagues after the vote. \u201cI pledge my allegiance and my loyalty to no interest in this building, to no interest in our politics. I pledge my loyalty to the people of the commonwealth.\u201d In Ohio and Pennsylvania, the House speaker can, with some restrictions, set the legislative agenda. In Alaska, which provides a fourth case study, bipartisan control of the legislature has a longer history. Without fanfare, 17 of the 20 members of the Alaska State Senate announced the formation of a bipartisan majority coalition in November that was empowered to run the upper chamber. The 2023-24 Alaska House has not yet chosen its leaders, but in the 2021-22 session, Louise Stutes, a Republican, was speaker, and Chris Tuck, a Democrat, was majority leader. State legislatures are gold mines of ground-level material revealing how polarization and partisanship influence both policymaking and politics. Vladimir Kogan, a political scientist at the Ohio State University, replied by email to my inquiry about developments at the state level, suggesting that evidence of Donald Trump\u2019s weakness in the 2022 elections has elevated Republican unease concerning ties to the former president: \u201cI suspect some of what you\u2019re seeing is party leaders updating their beliefs about electoral strategy and also trying to do damage control and protect the party brand going forward.\u201d In Ohio, Kogan noted, \u201cthere is a really important interest group story as well. Given the impotence of the small Democratic minority here, organized labor has been contributing significantly to Republican legislative candidates.\u201d In other words, some Republican members of the Ohio House have ties to unions that made them wary of supporting Merrin because of his advocacy of right-to-work legislation. At the same time, Kogan pointed out, Merrin\u2019s support of highly contentious issues like seemingly limitless gun rights and anti-abortion legislation worried \u201csome historically Republican-aligned interest groups in Ohio \u2014 particularly those in the business community and folks who care about economic development \u2014 which seem also concerned about some proposed and recently enacted legislation, especially legislation on social issues. I would not be surprised if they were involved behind the scenes as well.\u201d\n\nMichael Hartney, a political scientist at Boston College who focuses on state and local politics, emailed me his views on why some Republicans are moving toward the center: \u201cAlthough the causes behind these instances of moderation appear to me to be somewhat idiosyncratic to each state and chamber, I do believe that many Republicans are feeling more liberated to focus on pursuing their governing agenda than on appeasing Donald Trump. Clearly Trump is still an important figure in the party, but Trump\u2019s influence has surely waned.\u201d are showing they are ready to move on to pragmatic legislative dealing. In South Carolina, the speaker wants to do bipartisan work on economic development. In New Hampshire, Governor Sununu is calling the chance to cooperate and compromise \u201can awesome opportunity.\u201d It\u2019s quite plausible that the shifting political winds have led the most zealous \u201cnever McCarthy\u201d representatives to play as much hardball as possible now and get what they can while they can. Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has been sharply critical of the changing character of the Republican Party over the past three decades, wrote in an email: The state legislative maneuvers are truly encouraging. In a state like Ohio, the traditional conservatives have been appalled by the radicals, but it still took courage to do what they did. The noncrazy Republicans in Congress are all cowards. I hope I can revise that assessment if a sufficient number vote against the horrible rules package, but the odds are slim. I think the difference may be the lower visibility of state legislatures. In fact, on Monday in Washington the House approved McCarthy\u2019s rules package by a 220 to 213 vote, with only one Republican \u201cno\u201d vote. In terms of recent developments at the state level, two Republican pollsters, Ed Goeas, who recently retired as president of the Tarrance Group, and Neil Newhouse, a founding partner of Public Opinion Strategies, have substantially different interpretations. In a phone interview, Goeas argued that both parties have allowed their respective primaries to be dominated by the most ideologically extreme voters, with the result that \u201cthe two parties are failing us because they have allowed general elections to become contests between candidates who represent the far right and far left.\u201d Because of this, Goeas contended, \u201cmy sense is that people are ready and willing to return to more normal politics. People are tired of all this bickering and fighting.\u201d Newhouse wrote in an email, \u201cThis trend has less to do with G.O.P. legislators reading the tea leaves \u2014 signals \u2014 from voters calling for more moderation and bipartisanship and more to do with legislators\u2019 own self-preservation.\u201d it is probably safe to say that state legislatures are less polarized by partisanship than the U.S. Congress. It\u2019s probably not by much, as our data indicates that polarization reaches down to the very grass-roots elements of both political parties. Voters tend to give lip service when they talk about the need for partisan legislators to compromise \u2014 but what they are really saying is that Republicans want Democrats to compromise and Democrats want Republicans to do the same. Newhouse concluded, \u201cThere seems to be little to indicate that this extreme polarization is likely to improve in the near future; rather, we may not have reached bottom.\u201d\n\nRay Zaborney, a founding partner of Maverick Strategies, a Republican consulting firm based in Harrisburg, Pa., wrote by email that the vote for the Pennsylvania speaker, Rozzi, was \u201ca function of the closeness of the House,\u201d but, he continued, \u201cI do think that it\u2019s the intention \u2014 the desire \u2014 to get things done and not be hamstrung by a chamber that is 101 to 100. It was going to be almost impossible to pass an agenda that is partisan in that situation, and that move was some recognition of that.\u201d In other states and even in Washington, Zaborney continued, \u201cI think there is a recognition that the most extreme elements of both sides can\u2019t be in control.\u201d Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, suggested in an email that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization overturning Roe v. Wade was a crucial factor in the escalation of conflict within Republican ranks. This split became evident within weeks of the decision in the abortion rights vote cast by a majority of the electorate in Kansas, a red state, in an August referendum. In the Kansas governor\u2019s contest, \u201cmoderate Republicans rebelled against an extreme pro-life, anti-tax, antigovernment conservative, allowing Democrats to win the governorship,\u201d Greenberg wrote. Polling conducted by Democracy Corps, Greenberg said, shows that \u201cmoderates are Republicans because of race and immigration, but they are more pro-choice and pro-A.C.A. (the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare), and they are providing a base of voters and support for Republican leaders who are starting to shake up the party.\u201d During the current session of Congress, Greenberg wrote, \u201cI bet that there will be 10 to 20 Republicans who will work with Democrats to pass important legislation. And they will be empowered by the state examples and the perception that McCarthy is just in the pocket of the Tea Party and Trump Republicans.\u201d Perhaps the most important question regarding the contemporary struggles of the Republican Party is how much the factionalization of the party is driven by Trump and whether it will recede if he is pushed farther to the sidelines. On Jan. 9, CBS News/YouGov released a survey of 2,144 U.S. adult residents interviewed from Jan. 4 to Jan. 6 that showed substantial internal divisions within the Republican Party, between a dominant Trump wing and a smaller but substantial non-Trump faction.\n\nNearly three-quarters of voters CBS called \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d said \u201cinvestigating Joe Biden\u201d should be a high priority for the new Congress, and 47 percent of \u201cnon-MAGA Republicans\u201d agreed. Sixty-five percent of Republicans said \u201cbeing loyal to Donald Trump\u201d is very or somewhat important, while just over a third said such loyalty is not important at all or not very important. A decisive majority of all voters polled by CBS, 70 percent, said they would prefer the new Republican House to work with \u201cBiden and the Democrats to enact policies all can agree on,\u201d compared with 30 percent who said the Republican House should \u201coppose Biden and the Democrats to try to stop their policies.\u201d A majority of Republicans, 52 percent, said the House should oppose Biden and the Democrats, but a not insignificant 48 percent favored working with Biden and the Democrats. In practice, Republican leaders of the House have already adopted an agenda of opposing, investigating and defunding everything related to the Democratic Party. On Monday the House voted along partisan lines, 220 to 213, to cut $71 billion from the I.R.S. budget in an attempt to eliminate funds earmarked to finance closer examination of the returns of corporations and high-income taxpayers. \u201cWe will hold the swamp accountable, from the withdrawal of Afghanistan to the origins of Covid and to the weaponization of the F.B.I.,\u201d McCarthy told his colleagues after winning his battle to become speaker. \u201cLet me be very clear: We will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena to get the job done.\u201d On Tuesday, McCarthy won House approval, in a party-line, 221 to 211, vote, to create a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, with Jim Jordan, one of the most outspoken supporters of Trump and the MAGA movement in Congress, as its chairman. It\u2019s possible, although not very likely, that the MAGA electorate will rise up en masse in 2024 to reward House Republicans with another two years in the majority while pushing state-level Republicans who have moved from the right to the center, joined bipartisan alliances or challenged the party\u2019s extreme wing into political exile.",

UU. han ayudado a cimentar la relaci\u00f3n con el presidente de M\u00e9xico, cuya cooperaci\u00f3n en materia de migraci\u00f3n es crucial para el pa\u00eds del norte.\n\nCIUDAD DE M\u00c9XICO \u2014 Hace apenas dos a\u00f1os, el l\u00edder de M\u00e9xico no reconoc\u00eda la victoria electoral del presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden. Pero el lunes, los dos hombres aparecieron uno junto al otro en el palacio de gobierno de M\u00e9xico, en un abrazo colectivo con sus esposas. El presidente de M\u00e9xico, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, m\u00e1s tarde describir\u00eda a su contraparte estadounidense como un \u201cgobernante humanista y visionario\u201d y dijo que \u201cno habr\u00eda otro dirigente\u201d capaz de unificar al hemisferio occidental. Fue un cambio notable en una relaci\u00f3n clave que empez\u00f3 con incomodidad pero que ha virado en parte debido a que Biden invirti\u00f3 fuertemente en la diplomacia personal con el jefe de Estado mexicano, y L\u00f3pez Obrador entendi\u00f3 lo beneficioso que es estar en buenos t\u00e9rminos con Estados Unidos.\n\nDe ambos lados de la frontera hay desaf\u00edos significativos y urgentes y ambos pa\u00edses no siempre est\u00e1n alineados en cuanto a la forma de contener un movimiento extraordinario de personas en el continente americano, detener el comercio en aumento de fentanilo o combatir el cambio clim\u00e1tico. La reuni\u00f3n entre Biden, L\u00f3pez Obrador y el primer ministro de Canad\u00e1, Justin Trudeau, conocida como la Cumbre de L\u00edderes de Am\u00e9rica del Norte, concluy\u00f3 el martes sin arrojar demasiado en materia de nuevas pol\u00edticas para abordar dichos asuntos. Y no est\u00e1 claro si los gestos amistosos que se exhibieron en la cumbre se traducir\u00e1n en una cooperaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s duradera en temas contenciosos. En una conferencia de prensa el martes por la noche, L\u00f3pez Obrador enfatiz\u00f3 la importancia de dejar atr\u00e1s el \u201cintervencionismo hegem\u00f3nico\u201d y dijo que los tres pa\u00edses deben tratarse \u201ccomo buenos vecinos, como aliados econ\u00f3micos y amigos\u201d. La energ\u00eda sigue siendo un escollo, pues Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1 han acusado a M\u00e9xico de violar un acuerdo de libre comercio con sus pol\u00edticas de impulso a la estatal el\u00e9ctrica por encima de las compa\u00f1\u00edas internacionales. Pero la reuni\u00f3n envi\u00f3 un mensaje claro: a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de que el expresidente Donald Trump descuidara \u2014en el mejor de los casos, y en el peor, maltratara\u2014 las alianzas en Norteam\u00e9rica, Estados Unidos ha vuelto a estar en t\u00e9rminos amistosos con algunos de sus aliados m\u00e1s cercanos.\n\nAltos funcionarios de la gesti\u00f3n de Biden han reconocido que la relaci\u00f3n entre ambos l\u00edderes era clave para conseguir una colaboraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda por parte del gobierno de M\u00e9xico a fin de detener los flujos de personas que llegan hasta la frontera de Estados Unidos. \u201cEstoy agradecido de tenerlos a ustedes dos como socios \u2014y, puedo a\u00f1adir, amigos\u2014 mientras trabajamos juntos para llevar a cabo una visi\u00f3n compartida para Norteam\u00e9rica\u201d, dijo Biden a sus hom\u00f3logos canadiense y mexicano en la conferencia de prensa del martes. Biden ha estado enfocado en construir lazos personales con el l\u00edder mexicano, dijo un alto funcionario del Departamento de Estado que no ten\u00eda autorizaci\u00f3n para dar declaraciones en p\u00fablico. El funcionario indic\u00f3 que el presidente de EE. UU eligi\u00f3 M\u00e9xico como primer destino en sus viajes al hemisferio occidental y que los dos l\u00edderes hablan regularmente por tel\u00e9fono. Los intercambios amistosos representan un cambio notable en comparaci\u00f3n con el modo en el que empez\u00f3 la relaci\u00f3n.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador estuvo entre los \u00faltimos l\u00edderes mundiales en felicitar a Biden por su victoria electoral en 2020 y esper\u00f3 \u201chasta que se resuelvan todos los asuntos legales\u201d. La primera vez que ambos mandatarios hablaron por tel\u00e9fono tras las elecciones, L\u00f3pez Obrador se esmer\u00f3 en destacar la \u201cmuy buena relaci\u00f3n\u201d que su pa\u00eds hab\u00eda establecido con Trump. \u201cLa relaci\u00f3n entre AMLO y Biden empez\u00f3 con el pie izquierdo\u201d, dijo Martha B\u00e1rcena, a quien L\u00f3pez Obrador nombr\u00f3 como embajadora ante Estados Unidos de 2018 a 2020. Si bien Trump hab\u00eda llamado \u201cvioladores\u201d a algunos mexicanos y amenazado con una guerra comercial al socio econ\u00f3mico m\u00e1s cercano de Estados Unidos, al menos se adhiri\u00f3 a un principio que el l\u00edder mexicano apreciaba: en buena medida se qued\u00f3 al margen de los asuntos del pa\u00eds. Trump intimid\u00f3 de manera efectiva a M\u00e9xico para que aceptara una gran cantidad de migrantes expulsados de Estados Unidos, pero a su vez, dej\u00f3 que L\u00f3pez Obrador persiguiera una agenda interna ambiciosa sin decir mucho sobre el efecto a veces da\u00f1ino que esta ten\u00eda en los intereses estadounidenses. L\u00f3pez Obrador tem\u00eda que un enfoque de poco involucramiento cambiara con Biden, en parte porque el l\u00edder mexicano percib\u00eda a los dem\u00f3cratas como m\u00e1s interesados en imponer sus valores en los pa\u00edses latinoamericanos, seg\u00fan dijeron funcionarios y exfuncionarios de ambos pa\u00edses.\n\nLuego, en junio, desde\u00f1\u00f3 a Biden al rehusarse a acudir a una reuni\u00f3n de l\u00edderes de Am\u00e9rica organizada por su gesti\u00f3n en Los \u00c1ngeles porque Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua no hab\u00edan sido invitados. Pero en los \u00faltimos meses, la postura de L\u00f3pez Obrador pareci\u00f3 suavizarse. El l\u00edder mexicano, en sus conferencias de prensa matutinas, ha hablado de Biden en t\u00e9rminos elogiosos, tild\u00e1ndolo de \u201csensible\u201d y \u201crespetuoso\u201d. \u00bfQu\u00e9 cambi\u00f3? Los analistas se\u00f1alan el decepcionante desempe\u00f1o de los republicanos en las elecciones de medio mandato en EE. UU. y la recuperaci\u00f3n de Biden en las encuestas de opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, una se\u00f1al de que el presidente de Estados Unidos podr\u00eda ser pol\u00edticamente m\u00e1s fuerte de lo que esperaban muchos en M\u00e9xico. Para el l\u00edder mexicano, no obstante, las elecciones en su propio pa\u00eds son m\u00e1s apremiantes. Este a\u00f1o empezar\u00e1n las campa\u00f1as a la contienda presidencial de 2024 en M\u00e9xico, en las cuales L\u00f3pez Obrador no se puede postular. Pero se espera que tenga una influencia significativa en qui\u00e9n lo suceder\u00e1 al interior de su partido, Morena, y que luche para afianzar su legado durante otro sexenio. El presidente mexicano entiende que el gobierno de Estados Unidos, que tiene una enorme influencia econ\u00f3mica y pol\u00edtica en M\u00e9xico, podr\u00eda dificultar la implementaci\u00f3n de los cambios radicales que prometi\u00f3 al pa\u00eds despu\u00e9s de obtener una victoria abrumadora en 2018. Para L\u00f3pez Obrador, ahora es m\u00e1s valioso que nunca eliminar cualquier asomo de antagonismo entre los dos gobiernos.\n\nBiden tambi\u00e9n ha realizado un esfuerzo coordinado para cautivar a L\u00f3pez Obrador. Seis semanas despu\u00e9s de que Biden asumi\u00f3 el cargo, \u00e9l y el presidente mexicano realizaron su primera reuni\u00f3n virtual, en la que el mandatario estadounidense llen\u00f3 de halagos a su contraparte, dici\u00e9ndole que \u201clo que usted hace en M\u00e9xico\u201d repercute a todo el hemisferio. El verano pasado, luego de que L\u00f3pez Obrador se rehus\u00f3 a asistir a la cumbre regional organizada por su gobierno, Biden hizo aspavientos al invitar a su contraparte a la Casa Blanca. En dicha reuni\u00f3n, L\u00f3pez Obrador le dijo a Biden que \u201cle tenemos confianza porque respeta nuestra soberan\u00eda\u201d. Blanca Heredia, analista pol\u00edtica en el Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas de M\u00e9xico, dijo que los dos l\u00edderes eran \u201ccomo una pareja que al principio no se acopla a bailar, pero luego se est\u00e1n empezando a acoplar\u201d. \u201cNo es solo que sea mejor que ellos no peleen\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, \u201ces que son mutuamente indispensables el uno para el otro\u201d.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador se jact\u00f3 de que el mismo presidente estadounidense \u201cme pon\u00eda los botones\u201d, en referencia a los controles del veh\u00edculo. \u201cEs una muy buena persona\u201d.

Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the new chairman of the committee, has pledged for months to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s family and its business connections. His staff members obtained the contents of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, whose business activities are under federal investigation.\n\nBut now that Mr. Comer has subpoena power, he is in a position to expand and escalate his inquiry. He has repeatedly said that his focus will be on the occupant of the White House. \u201cThis is an investigation of Joe Biden,\u201d he has said.\n\nThe four letters Mr. Comer sent on Wednesday do not include subpoenas. The first is a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen seeking information about so-called suspicious activity reports, or SARs, involving the business dealings of Hunter Biden and James Biden, the president\u2019s brother, that the committee has yet to obtain.",

In a 24-hour experiment, one journalist tried to go plastic free.\n\nTo avoid sitting on plastic, the writer brought a wooden chair to the New York City subway.\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. On the morning of the day I had decided to go without using plastic products \u2014 or even touching plastic \u2014 I opened my eyes and put my bare feet on the carpet. Which is made of nylon, a type of plastic. I was roughly 10 seconds into my experiment, and I had already committed a violation. Since its invention more than a century ago, plastic has crept into every aspect of our lives. It\u2019s hard to go even a few minutes without touching this durable, lightweight, wildly versatile substance. Plastic has made possible thousands of modern conveniences, but it has come with downsides, especially for the environment. Last week, in a 24-hour experiment, I tried to live without it altogether in an effort to see what plastic stuff we can\u2019t do without and what we may be able to give up. Most mornings I check my iPhone soon after waking up. On the appointed day, this was not possible, given that, in addition to aluminum, iron, lithium, gold and copper, each iPhone contains plastic. In preparation for the experiment, I had stashed my device in a closet. I quickly found that not having access to it left me feeling disoriented and bold, as if I were some sort of intrepid time traveler.\n\nI made my way toward the bathroom, only to stop myself before I went in. \u201cCould you open the door for me?\u201d I asked my wife, Julie. \u201cThe doorknob has a plastic coating.\u201d She opened it for me, letting out a \u201cthis is going to be a long day\u201d sigh. My morning hygiene routine needed a total revamp, which required detailed preparations in the days before my experiment. I could not use my regular toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo or liquid soap, all of which were encased in plastic or made of plastic. Fortunately, there is a huge industry of plastic-free products targeted at eco-conscious consumers, and I had bought an array of them, a haul that included a bamboo toothbrush with bristles made of wild boar hair from Life Without Plastic. \u201cThe bristles are completely sterilized,\u201d Jay Sinha, the company\u2019s co-owner, assured me when I spoke with him the week before. Instead of toothpaste, I had a jar of gray charcoal-mint toothpaste pellets. I popped one in, chewed it, sipped water and brushed. It was nice and minty, though the ash-colored spit was unsettling.\n\nTaking a blogger\u2019s advice, I mixed a D.I.Y. deodorant out of tea tree oil and baking soda. It left me smelling a little like a medieval cathedral, but in a good way. Making your own stuff is another way to avoid plastic, though it does require another luxury: free time. Before I was done in the bathroom, I had broken the rules a second time, by using the toilet. Getting dressed was also a challenge, given that so many clothing items include plastic. I had ordered a pair of wool pants that promised to be plastic free, but they had not arrived. In their stead, I chose a pair of old Banana Republic chinos. The tag said \u201c100 percent cotton,\u201d but when I had checked the day before with a very helpful Banana Republic public relations representative, it turned out to be a little more complicated. The main fabric is indeed 100 percent cotton, but there was plastic lurking in the zipper tape, the internal waistband, woven label, pocketing and threads, the representative told me. I cut my thumb trying to slice off the black brand label with an all-metal knife. Instead of a Band-Aid \u2014 yes, plastic \u2014 I used some gummed paper tape to stop the bleeding. Happily, my underwear did not represent a plastic violation \u2014 blue boxers from Cottonique made of 100 percent organic cotton with a cotton drawstring in place of the elastic (which is often plastic) waistband. I had found this item via an internet list of \u201c14 Hot & Sustainable Underwear Brands for Men.\u201d\n\nFor my upper body, I lucked out. Our friend Kristen had knitted my wife a sweater for a birthday present. It had rectangles of blue and purple, and it was 100 percent merino wool. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stretch it out,\u201d Julie said. The world produces about 400 million metric tons of plastic waste each year, according to a United Nations report. About half is tossed out after a single use. The report noted that \u201cwe have become addicted to single-use plastic products \u2014 with severe environmental, social, economic and health consequences.\u201d I\u2019m one of the addicts. I did an audit, and I\u2019d estimate that I toss about 800 plastic items in the garbage a year \u2014 takeout containers, pens, cups, Amazon packages with foam inside and more. Before my Day of No Plastic, I immersed myself in a number of no-plastic and zero-waste books, videos and podcasts. One of the books, \u201cLife Without Plastic: The Practical Step-by-Step Guide to Avoiding Plastic to Keep Your Family and the Planet Healthy,\u201d by Mr. Sinha and Chantal Plamondon, came from Amazon wrapped in clear plastic, like a slice of American cheese. When I mentioned this to Mr. Sinha, he promised to look into it. I also called Gabby Salazar, a social scientist who studies what motivates people to support environmental causes, and asked for her advice as I headed into my plastic-free day.\n\nAdmittedly, living completely without plastic is probably an absurd idea. Despite its faults, plastic is a crucial ingredient in medical equipment, smoke alarms and helmets. There\u2019s truth to the plastics industry\u2019s catchphrase from the 1990s: \u201cPlastics make it possible.\u201d In many cases it can help the environment: Plastic airplane parts are lighter than metal ones, which mean less fuel and lower CO\u2082 emissions. Solar panels and wind turbines have plastic parts. That said, the world is overloaded with the stuff, especially the disposable forms. The Earth Policy Institute estimates that people go through one trillion single-use plastic bags each year. The crisis was a long time coming. There\u2019s some debate over when plastic entered the world, but many date it to 1855, when a British metallurgist, Alexander Parkes, patented a thermoplastic material as a waterproof coating for fabrics. He called the substance \u201cParkesine.\u201d Over the decades, labs across the world birthed other types, all with a similar chemistry: They are polymer chains, and most are made from petroleum or natural gas. Thanks to chemical additives, plastics vary wildly. They can be opaque or transparent, foamy or hard, stretchy or brittle. They are known by many names, including polyester and Styrofoam, and by shorthand like PVC and PET.\n\nPlastic manufacturing ramped up for World War II and was crucial to the war effort, providing nylon parachutes and Plexiglas aircraft windows. That was followed by a postwar boom, said Susan Freinkel, the author of \u201cPlastic: A Toxic Love Story,\u201d a book on the history and science of plastic. \u201cPlastic went into things like Formica counters, refrigerator liners, car parts, clothing, shoes, just all sorts of stuff that was designed to be used for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere we really started to get into trouble is when it started going into single-use stuff,\u201d Ms. Freinkel said. \u201cI call it prefab litter.\u201d The outpouring of straws, cups, bags and other ephemera has led to disastrous consequences for the environment. According to a study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than 11 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans each year, leaching into the water, disrupting the food chain and choking marine life. Close to one-fifth of plastic waste gets burned, releasing CO2 into the air, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which also reports that only 9 percent of plastics are recycled. Some aren\u2019t economical to recycle, and other types degrade in quality when they are. Plastic may also harm our health. Certain plastic additives \u2014 such as BPA and phthalates \u2014 may disrupt the endocrine system in humans, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Worrying effects may include behavioral problems and lower testosterone levels in boys and lower thyroid hormone levels and preterm births for women. \u201cSolving this plastic problem can\u2019t fall entirely on the shoulders of consumers,\u201d Dr. Salazar told me. \u201cWe need to work on it on all fronts.\u201d\n\nEarly in my no-plastic day, I started to see the world differently. Everything looked menacing, like it might be harboring hidden polymers. The kitchen was particularly fraught. Anything I could use for cooking was off-limits \u2014 the toaster, the oven, the microwave. Even leftovers were a no-go. My son waved a plastic baggie filled with French toast. \u201cYou want some of this?\u201d Yes, I did. Instead, I decided to go foraging for raw food items. I left my building using the stairs, rather than the elevator with its plastic buttons, and walked to a health food store near our apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. When I go shopping, I try to remember to take a cloth bag with me. This time, I had brought along seven bags of varying sizes, all of them cotton. I also had two glass containers. At the store, I filled up one of my cotton bags with apples and oranges. On close inspection, I noticed that the each rind had a sticker with a code. Another likely violation, but I ignored it. At the bulk bins, I scooped walnuts and oatmeal into my glass dishes using a (washed) steel ladle I had brought from home. The bins themselves were plastic, which I ignored, because I was hungry.\n\nHe added that he appreciated my commitment to the environment. It was the first positive feedback I\u2019d received. I counted out $19.02 \u2014 exact change! \u2014 and went home to eat my breakfast: nuts and oranges on a metal cookie tray, which I balanced on my lap. A couple of hours later, in search of a plastic-free lunch, I walked to Lenwich, a sandwich and salad shop in my neighborhood. I arrived early in the afternoon, toting my rectangular glass dish and bamboo cutlery. \u201cCan you make the salad in this glass container?\u201d I asked, holding it up. \u201cOne minute please,\u201d the man behind the counter said, tersely. He called over a manager, who said OK. Victory! But the manager then rejected my follow-up request to use my steel scooper. After lunch, I headed to Central Park, figuring that this was a spot in Manhattan where I could relax in a plastic-free environment. I took the subway there, which scored me more violations, since the trains themselves have plastic parts and you need a MetroCard or smartphone to get through the turnstiles. At least I didn\u2019t sit in one of those plastic orange seats. I had brought my own: an unpainted, fold-up Nordic-style teak chair, hard and austere. It\u2019s what I had been using at the apartment to avoid the plastic-tainted chairs and couches.\n\nI woke up the next morning glad to have survived my ordeal and be reunited with my phone \u2014 but also with a feeling of defeat. I had made 164 violations, by my count. As Dr. Salazar had predicted, I felt overwhelmed. And also uncertain. There was so much that remained unclear, even after I had been studying this topic for weeks. What plastic-free items really made a difference, and what is mere green-washing? Is it a good idea to use boar\u2019s-hair toothbrushes, tea tree deodorant, microplastic-filtering devices and paper straws, or does the trouble of using those things make everyone so bonkers that they actually end up damaging the cause? \u201cYou can drive yourself crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about perfection, it\u2019s about progress. Believe it or not, individual behavior does matter. It adds up. \u201cRemember,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s not about plastic being the enemy. It\u2019s about single-use as the enemy. It\u2019s the culture of using something once and throwing it away.\u201d I thought back to something that the author Susan Freinkel had told me: \u201cI\u2019m not an absolutist at all. If you came into my kitchen, you would be like, what the hell? You wrote this book and look at how you live!\u201d Ms. Freinkel does make an effort, she said. She avoids single-use bags, cups and packaging, among other things. I pledge to try, too, even after my not wholly successful attempt at a one-day ban.",

The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Mr. Santos handed over was impressive, particularly for a political neophyte. He claimed to have graduated in the top 1 percent of his class at Baruch College, earned an M.B.A. at New York University and more than doubled revenue as a project manager at Goldman Sachs, according to a copy of the two-page document obtained by The New York Times.\n\nIf the Nassau Republicans had dug into any of the claims, they would probably have found that much of Mr. Santos\u2019s account was baldly fabricated. Instead, without another candidate interested in the race, they made a critical mistake: They took Mr. Santos\u2019s word and offered their full backing, re-upping in 2022 to help deliver him to victory.\n\nThe episode marks an early example of a yearslong pattern of political deception, when Mr. Santos lied to his own party and faced no immediate repercussions. Three years later, it provided part of the backdrop on Wednesday when Nassau County committee leaders moved definitively to cut ties with Mr. Santos, calling him a serial liar and demanding he resign from Congress.\n\u2022 None An Investor\u2019s Experience: Andrew Intrater, a wealthy businessman, Andrew Intrater, a wealthy businessman, has been in touch with the Securities and Exchange Commission about Representative George Santos\u2019s dealings with a company accused in a Ponzi scheme.\n\u2022 None Tilting to the Hard Right: Mr. Santos\u2019s actions in and out of the House chamber so far this year suggest that his stance in Congress Mr. Santos\u2019s actions in and out of the House chamber so far this year suggest that his stance in Congress will be further to the right than the one he adopted on the campaign trail.\n\u2022 None Clothes Make the Con Man: To look the part he conceived for himself, Mr. Santos went deep into the costume department of the popular culture hive mind and To look the part he conceived for himself, Mr. Santos went deep into the costume department of the popular culture hive mind and built his cover story garment by garment\n\u2022 None Holes in the Gate-Keeping System: Interviews and documents obtained by The Times show that Interviews and documents obtained by The Times show that some Republicans had indications far earlier than the public did that Mr. Santos was spinning an elaborate web of deceits. \u201cHe answered the questions \u2014 obviously not truthfully \u2014 but at that time we trusted him,\u201d Joseph G. Cairo Jr., the committee chairman, told reporters at a news conference, vowing to put in place a more rigorous vetting process. He added: \u201cWe were duped here.\u201d Mr. Cairo said in a recent interview that Mr. Santos assured his vetting team that he had no arrest record and no knowledge of \u201canyone who might have a grievance\u201d that could harm his candidacy. The congressman quickly rebuffed the calls for his resignation, vowing on Twitter on Wednesday to continue serving despite a gusher of damaging disclosures that started with a Times investigation last month. Joe Murray, a lawyer representing Mr. Santos, deferred a request for comment to the congressman\u2019s Washington office. A spokeswoman there did not immediately reply.\n\nThe news conference is unlikely to quiet pressure on Republican leaders, who have been criticized for looking past questions about Mr. Santos\u2019s truthfulness during last year\u2019s campaign, especially after news media and Democratic operatives unearthed apparent contradictions or notable omissions that called into question his claim to be a successful financier. The Times has been asking Mr. Santos for a copy of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for weeks. A copy of the two-page version Mr. Santos submitted to the committee around January 2020 and obtained by The Times is the first that has become public. A Nassau County G.O.P. official said the committee could no longer locate the supplemental vetting questionnaire he submitted. In other contexts, Mr. Santos was loath to offer dates and firm details on his academic and work history, which might have made them easier to disprove. In the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he wrote them down in precise detail. Mr. Santos claimed to have graduated summa cum laude with a 3.89 G.P.A. at Baruch College in 2010. He said he went on to earn the M.B.A. in 2013, after scoring an impressive 710 on the GMAT. Neither degree was real.\n\nThe document also shows how Mr. Santos fabricated and inflated his work pedigree. He said he worked as an associate asset manager at Citigroup from February 2011 to January 2014, with responsibilities as varied as \u201cconsumer education of new opportunities\u201d and \u201cinvestment orientation on LP base.\u201d He claimed to have \u201c2X revenue growth (300M to 600M)\u201d in the just over seven months he worked as a project manager at Goldman Sachs in 2017 and to have developed a new sales strategy \u201cfor the department.\u201d Both companies have told The Times they have no record of his ever having worked there, and at the time Mr. Santos claims he was working at Citi, he was actually working for Dish Network as a customer service agent.",

            "content": "After her son-in-law refused her offer to pay someone to accompany her 9-year-old granddaughter from the bus stop, a worried reader wonders what she can do.\n\nAfter school, my granddaughter, 9, walks a quarter of a mile \u2014 by herself \u2014 from the bus stop to her house while her father works from home. She texts him when she gets on the school bus, and, most days, she is the only child walking in the direction of her house. They live in a fairly safe suburb, but the situation seems dangerous to me. My concern is the constant traffic of gardeners, painters and delivery people through the neighborhood who could harm her. Her father believes the walk is good for her confidence, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk. I\u2019ve offered to pay for someone to meet the bus, walk her home and get her started on homework, but I was refused. My daughter defers to her husband. This situation keeps me up at night! Any suggestions? I\u2019m a worrier, too. So, let\u2019s talk this out. There is no magic age at which a child can walk home safely from school or the bus stop. That depends on her maturity and the safety of the neighborhood. Even so, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children ages 9 to 11 \u2014 who have good judgment \u2014 are ready to start. I know it can be scary to envision a child alone in the world, navigating all kinds of adults she doesn\u2019t know \u2014 not just laborers. But rather than torturing yourself with worst-case scenarios that are extremely rare, let\u2019s focus on your granddaughter\u2019s readiness, instead. Does she know the route? Will she keep her eyes on the road (and off her phone)? Will she scream and run if a stranger approaches her too closely?\n\nHer father seems to have decided that the walk is safe and she\u2019s up to the task. I doubt your daughter would defer to him if she disagreed. And they probably know their child better than you do. Psychologists concur with your son-in-law that walking home alone can boost a child\u2019s confidence. So, rather than pressing your case (on which you don\u2019t get a vote, frankly), perhaps observe your granddaughter from a distance one day to see for yourself how she navigates this challenge. I hope it puts your mind at ease. The Hosts\u2019 Aim? Sensitivity. Their Guests\u2019? Well \u2026 We host regular bridge games for a group of eight people. When using our bathroom, a couple of the men seem to have trouble keeping their urine inside the toilet. (It is often running down the outside or on the floor.) We don\u2019t know if this is a medical issue or poor manners, but we\u2019re grossed out when having to do the cleanup. How can we approach this issue in a clear but sensitive manner? I have rarely cleaned a bathroom without wondering why men are allowed to pee standing up. Our aim is not that reliable! Still, I would probably avoid speaking to guests directly. It suggests you are paying too-close attention to their bathroom habits (and personally, I dislike making anyone feel uncomfortable in my home). Try this instead: Make sure the toilet seat is down at the beginning of the evening and affix a note to the underside: \u201cPlease sit to urinate unless your aim is flawless.\u201d Let me know how it goes. We can take it from there. That Terrible Age When Choices Start to Matter My ex-girlfriend and I, both 30-ish, recently ended our short but intense relationship because I want kids eventually and she (adamantly) does not. The breakup was hard; we still feel a strong connection and affection for each other. We agreed not to text, but we\u2019re finding that difficult. My head tells me that resuming this relationship would be a mistake. It will only make it harder to leave when my desire for kids is more pressing. But my heart doesn\u2019t want to give up on this rare feeling of deep compatibility. What should I do?\n\nI was about your age when it hit me, with considerable force, that many of the choices I was then making \u2014 about career, geography and relationships \u2014 were narrowing the sense of unfettered possibility I had enjoyed throughout my 20s. Welcome to (true) adulthood! I don\u2019t know if you definitely want kids or simply want to keep that option open for now. (There\u2019s a difference!) Nothing would foreclose it like committing yourself to a woman who is adamantly opposed to parenthood. If you are not willing to seriously consider a life without children, move on. I know this is a hard decision. And it won\u2019t be your last one, either. My sister told me she had approached her adult daughter\u2019s longtime boyfriend and had said if he ever decided to propose marriage to her daughter, she would appreciate it if he used our grandmother\u2019s engagement ring. I feel sorry for the young man, and my gut reaction is to pull him aside and tell him to ignore my sister and listen to his heart. Your thoughts? Sorry, but your gut reaction is wrong. Please keep out of this. It\u2019s bad enough that your sister butted into her daughter\u2019s relationship behind her back, creating awkward pressure on her boyfriend. But adding your two cents \u2014 even with a corrective message \u2014 will not help matters. It only keeps the awkwardness going. Let\u2019s hope the boyfriend decides to ignore your sister on his own. For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nEven as President Biden and the leaders of Canada and Mexico sought to emphasize their shared commitments, the tricky issue of immigration dominated much of the discussion.\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 President Biden on Tuesday defended his handling of the border and thanked his Mexican counterpart for a willingness to accept asylum seekers rejected by the United States during a period of what he called \u201cthe greatest migration in human history\u201d across the region. In remarks at the end of a two-day summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Mr. Biden dismissed criticism from Republicans, Democrats and humanitarian groups, calling them the \u201cextremes\u201d and saying he was pursuing a middle ground in his approach to immigration. \u201cI want to thank the president of Mexico for agreeing to take up to 3,000 people back,\u201d Mr. Biden said, apparently referring to the announcement last week that Mexico would accept 30,000 migrants each month from Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and Cuba who attempt to cross into the United States illegally. That increased enforcement at the border has been condemned by Democrats and human rights groups as an inhumane denial of asylum rights. But Mr. Biden said on Tuesday that the creation of new legal immigration programs for people from those countries counterbalanced that effort.\n\n\u201cThere can no longer be any question, none, in today\u2019s interconnected world. We cannot wall ourselves off from shared problems,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it easier for people to get here.\u201d The president\u2019s comments followed several hours of closed-door discussions with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada that also focused on the climate crisis, drug trafficking, economic prosperity and trade. All three men said the summit underscored the cooperation among their governments and played down longstanding disagreements and tensions, especially over the economic competition in energy and emerging technologies like electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re true partners, the three of us,\u201d Mr. Biden said at a news conference after the meetings. But if the summit was intended to show a shared commitment to addressing immigration, it also showed the intractability of the issue. Questions about how to confront the waves of people fleeing their homelands across Central and South America dominated much of the private discussion and the public statement to the news media, and a fact sheet distributed by the White House listing \u201ckey deliverables\u201d from the summit did not include any new major migration initiatives.\n\nAides to Mr. Biden said the broader challenge of how to secure the border was his top priority at the summit. In a one-on-one meeting on Monday night, Mr. Biden and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador \u201creaffirmed their commitment to implement innovative approaches to address irregular migration,\u201d according to a White House summary of the meeting. At the news conference after the summit, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador delivered a lengthy history of the changes in migration patterns over the past several decades and emphasized his belief that the best way to prevent people from leaving their homes was to invest in making their countries prosperous and safe. He praised Mr. Biden for what he said was a recognition of that reality while criticizing past American presidents for focusing too heavily on trying to keep migrants out of the country. \u201cYou are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cAnd that \u2014 we thank you for that, sir.\u201d How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process. The Mexican president also took a veiled swipe at Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, who bused a group of migrants to Washington last month and dropped them off in frigid weather in front of the Naval Observatory, the home for Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cThis is politicking. This is completely inhuman,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said, referring to \u201cone of the governors\u201d in a \u201cneighboring country\u201d in his remarks. \u201cAnd this should not be done.\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador hosted Mr. Biden and Mr. Trudeau for the closed-door discussions at the National Palace in Mexico City, the seat of government and the residence for the Mexican president.\n\nMr. Trudeau emphasized economic cooperation on the continent, saying the three leaders were \u201call dedicated to driving economic growth that supports the middle class and those working hard to join it.\u201d Other issues on Tuesday\u2019s agenda included renewed efforts to combat trafficking of drugs and weapons in North America. Biden administration officials have been frustrated in the past two years with what they say is a lack of Mexican cooperation in drug investigations. The White House fact sheet said the leaders had agreed to strengthen the North American Drug Dialogue to increase information sharing and to enhance collaboration among all three nations on nuclear security and safety. Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trudeau discussed the close relationship between their countries as they continued to deal with what Mr. Trudeau called \u201cvery real challenges,\u201d such as support for democracy around the world and climate change. \u201cWhen we work together, we can achieve great things,\u201d Mr. Biden told Mr. Trudeau, adding that there is \u201cunlimited economic potential\u201d when the two countries collaborate. \u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d he added, \u201cI got Canada to the north and Mexico to the south.\u201d\n\nThe three leaders met as a trade agreement that has knit the economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico more closely together will face a significant test this week, as a panel of experts is expected to rule that the United States has violated the agreement\u2019s rules related to car manufacturing. The pending decision on one of several prominent North American trade spats comes as the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening trade between their economies and upholding the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. All three countries are being criticized by their trading partners for violating various aspects of that pact, which revised and updated the older North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. The United States and Canada continue to clash over Canada\u2019s system for managing its dairy industry, while Mexico has garnered criticism for its energy policies and plan to ban imports of genetically modified corn, which would hurt American producers.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA new adaptation of the novel \u201cThe Lying Life of Adults\u201d features formidable female central characters and an Italy with distinct social classes.\n\nLike the novel by Elena Ferrante on which it is based, the opening line of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Lying Life of Adults\u201d is spoken by the precocious teenage protagonist, Giovanna, who is listening at the door while her parents talk about her. \u201cBefore leaving home, my father told my mother that I was ugly,\u201d Giovanna says, adding forlornly that he had compared her to his estranged sister Vittoria, an insult so vile that it prompted Giovanna\u2019s mother to counter: \u201cDon\u2019t say that. She is a monster.\u201d Thus the viewer is introduced to Giovanna (Giordana Marengo) and Vittoria (Valeria Golino), fitting new entries in the pseudonymous Italian author\u2019s rich stable of formidable female central characters. Brought to life onscreen in a recent six-episode adaptation of Ferrante\u2019s 2019 novel, they are as complex and contradictory as Lila and Len\u00f9, the main characters of Ferrante\u2019s four best-selling novels chronicling their friendship, a version of which appeared in HBO\u2019s \u201cMy Brilliant Friend.\u201d In \u201cThe Lying Life of Adults,\u201d too, Naples provides a socially textured setting for this coming-of-age story, which propels Giovanna from the innocence of childhood into the world of adults\u2019 complex and contradictory compromises. Set in the mid-1990s, the series underscores the slippery social standing of Italian girls, and women, seeking to find a footing in a world where men call the shots.\n\nIn \u201cLying Life,\u201d Giovanna navigates two distinct Neapolitan neighborhoods so drastically diverse that it is hard to believe they belong to the same city. She lives in the Rione Alto, an upper-middle-class neighborhood mostly developed in the 1960s and \u201970s capping the Vomero hill with breathtaking views of the Gulf of Naples. \u201cOutside of the Vomero, the city scarcely belonged to me,\u201d Giovanna says in the novel. The mysterious Italian writer has won international attention with her intimate representations of Neapolitan life, womanhood and friendship.\n\u2022 None Beginner\u2019s Guide: New to Elena Ferrante\u2019s work?

Humility is a hallmark of her approach.\n\u2022 None \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019: The HBO series based on Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels is a testament to the elusive writer\u2019s ability to create inscrutable characters.\n\u2022 None \u2018The Lying Life of Adults\u2019: A new adaptation of the novel, which was published in English in 2020, features formidable female central characters and an Italy with distinct social classes. But in her determination to meet her aunt, Giovanna opens her world to the lower city neighborhood that her father, Andrea (Alessandro Preziosi) escaped, but that Vittoria still inhabits: a run-down district called Pascone in the novel, which was shot in the formerly industrial rough-and-tumble Poggioreale neighborhood. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any city in Italy where the differences between social classes are as evident as Naples, and at times where this difference counts so little,\u201d Francesco Piccolo, one of the show\u2019s four screenwriters, said at the news conference. In the series, viewers who do not speak Italian might miss the fact that the contrast is underscored by the difference in the Neapolitan dialect spoken between the two neighborhoods. In the wealthy Vomero, the dialect is spoken \u201cfor pleasure, for fun,\u201d Piccolo said, while in the other, it is \u201ca totally emotional dialect.\u201d Getting Vittoria right, her movements as well as her dialect, weighed on Golino, who may be best remembered by American audiences for her star turn in the films \u201cRain Man\u201d and \u201cHot Shots!\u201d She, too, grew up in the Vomero neighborhood, on \u201cthe good side of the tracks,\u201d she said in a telephone interview, and confessed to never having seen the \u201cNaples of Vittoria,\u201d to the point that she \u201chad to go find it, understand it.\u201d A voice coach taught what was to her essentially a new language. \u201cEven though I am Neapolitan, I had never spoken in that way,\u201d Golino said. \u201cIt was a sound that I had heard in the city, but it was never part of my world.\u201d To embody the earthy bawdiness of Vittoria \u201cwas difficult,\u201d the actress said. \u201cI had to study the words, a way of moving, a way of inhabiting space,\u201d which was foreign to her. \u201cSo I spent a lot of time in Naples, which is my city, but Naples is made of many layers,\u201d she said. Golino, center, was nervous about getting the character of Vittoria right. \u201cI had to study the words, a way of moving, a way of inhabiting space,\u201d the actor said. In turn, Marengo, 19, who made her screen debut as Giovanna after being selected from among 3,000 girls auditioning for the role, said Golino had nurtured her throughout the series. \u201cShe gave me a lot of advice,\u201d Marengo said, and the two created a strong bond that Marengo thought was apparent on screen, she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe really helped each other,\u201d Golino said. \u201cWe were both in the same state of mind. She because it was her first time, I because I was constantly afraid of making a mistake.\u201d Marengo said she had felt the responsibility of portraying the protagonist of a story that evolves entirely from Giovanna\u2019s perspective. \u201cAt first, I was anxious that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it,\u201d she said. But the director and the crew made sure she did not feel that responsibility, \u201cand that really calmed me down,\u201d she said. In the novel, Giovanna\u2019s inward gaze is even more pronounced. But Edoardo De Angelis, the show\u2019s director, said transposing that inner rumination into visual form was a natural extension of Ferrante\u2019s writing. \u201cEvery single word contains an evocation that suggests and invokes a multitude of images,\u201d De Angelis said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe words always suggested the path to take because Ferrante\u2019s evocations are always very concrete, even if they begin with an interior thought.\u201d De Angelis\u2019s Naples involves a cacophony of colors and sounds, the underground music scene in the city\u2019s avant-garde community centers and the nostalgia of summer festivals hosted by Italy\u2019s once-powerful Communist Party. Ferrante, the famously elusive author who has never officially made her identity public, has a screenwriting credit, and De Angelis, who is also credited with writing the script with Piccolo and Laura Paolucci, said that correspondence with Ferrante had involved \u201cmany letters to find a common language.\u201d In transposing the novel to television, the story also took an unexpected turn, a plot twist that is not in the novel but that Ferrante signed off on, De Angelis said: She was well aware that moving from the pages to the screen \u201cwas an occasion to express elements that were only suggested and left to the imagination in the novel,\u201d while on the screen, \u201cthe imagination becomes image,\u201d offering the possibility of \u201cmore radical choices.\u201d These radical choices open new avenues, and the episodes end with a series of unresolved questions to be answered, perhaps, in a possible sequel. (To this reader, the ending of the novel also suggested that a second book could follow.) Just as Golino worried about doing the character of Vittoria justice, \u201cour series aims to show the authenticity of Italy, even outside of stereotypes,\u201d Eleonora Andreatta, affectionately known as \u201cTinny,\u201d the vice president of Italian originals at Netflix, said at the news conference.

But in her determination to meet her aunt, Giovanna opens her world to the lower city neighborhood that her father, Andrea (Alessandro Preziosi) escaped, but that Vittoria still inhabits: a run-down district called Pascone in the novel, which was shot in the formerly industrial rough-and-tumble Poggioreale neighborhood. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any city in Italy where the differences between social classes are as evident as Naples, and at times where this difference counts so little,\u201d Francesco Piccolo, one of the show\u2019s four screenwriters, said at the news conference. In the series, viewers who do not speak Italian might miss the fact that the contrast is underscored by the difference in the Neapolitan dialect spoken between the two neighborhoods. In the wealthy Vomero, the dialect is spoken \u201cfor pleasure, for fun,\u201d Piccolo said, while in the other, it is \u201ca totally emotional dialect.\u201d\n\nGetting Vittoria right, her movements as well as her dialect, weighed on Golino, who may be best remembered by American audiences for her star turn in the films \u201cRain Man\u201d and \u201cHot Shots!\u201d She, too, grew up in the Vomero neighborhood, on \u201cthe good side of the tracks,\u201d she said in a telephone interview, and confessed to never having seen the \u201cNaples of Vittoria,\u201d to the point that she \u201chad to go find it, understand it.\u201d A voice coach taught what was to her essentially a new language. \u201cEven though I am Neapolitan, I had never spoken in that way,\u201d Golino said. \u201cIt was a sound that I had heard in the city, but it was never part of my world.\u201d To embody the earthy bawdiness of Vittoria \u201cwas difficult,\u201d the actress said. \u201cI had to study the words, a way of moving, a way of inhabiting space,\u201d which was foreign to her. \u201cSo I spent a lot of time in Naples, which is my city, but Naples is made of many layers,\u201d she said.\n\nIn turn, Marengo, 19, who made her screen debut as Giovanna after being selected from among 3,000 girls auditioning for the role, said Golino had nurtured her throughout the series. \u201cShe gave me a lot of advice,\u201d Marengo said, and the two created a strong bond that Marengo thought was apparent on screen, she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe really helped each other,\u201d Golino said. \u201cWe were both in the same state of mind. She because it was her first time, I because I was constantly afraid of making a mistake.\u201d Marengo said she had felt the responsibility of portraying the protagonist of a story that evolves entirely from Giovanna\u2019s perspective. \u201cAt first, I was anxious that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it,\u201d she said. But the director and the crew made sure she did not feel that responsibility, \u201cand that really calmed me down,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the novel, Giovanna\u2019s inward gaze is even more pronounced. But Edoardo De Angelis, the show\u2019s director, said transposing that inner rumination into visual form was a natural extension of Ferrante\u2019s writing. \u201cEvery single word contains an evocation that suggests and invokes a multitude of images,\u201d De Angelis said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe words always suggested the path to take because Ferrante\u2019s evocations are always very concrete, even if they begin with an interior thought.\u201d De Angelis\u2019s Naples involves a cacophony of colors and sounds, the underground music scene in the city\u2019s avant-garde community centers and the nostalgia of summer festivals hosted by Italy\u2019s once-powerful Communist Party. Ferrante, the famously elusive author who has never officially made her identity public, has a screenwriting credit, and De Angelis, who is also credited with writing the script with Piccolo and Laura Paolucci, said that correspondence with Ferrante had involved \u201cmany letters to find a common language.\u201d In transposing the novel to television, the story also took an unexpected turn, a plot twist that is not in the novel but that Ferrante signed off on, De Angelis said: She was well aware that moving from the pages to the screen \u201cwas an occasion to express elements that were only suggested and left to the imagination in the novel,\u201d while on the screen, \u201cthe imagination becomes image,\u201d offering the possibility of \u201cmore radical choices.\u201d These radical choices open new avenues, and the episodes end with a series of unresolved questions to be answered, perhaps, in a possible sequel. (To this reader, the ending of the novel also suggested that a second book could follow.)\n\nJust as Golino worried about doing the character of Vittoria justice, \u201cour series aims to show the authenticity of Italy, even outside of stereotypes,\u201d Eleonora Andreatta, affectionately known as \u201cTinny,\u201d the vice president of Italian originals at Netflix, said at the news conference. She also worked on the \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d series in her previous job at RAI. \u201cPortraying a character that is not edifying, in which you draw out the human, the real human that makes mistakes,\u201d and who was \u201cdisobedient\u201d was one of the reasons that she had accepted the role, \u201ceven though it frightened me,\u201d Golino said in the telephone interview. \u201cA good actor doesn\u2019t have to be a good liar, but usually they are,\u201d she said at the news conference, eliciting laughs. \u201cIf they have to tell a lie, a good actor tells it very well.\u201d",

            "content": "LastPass, un servicio que gestiona contrase\u00f1as fue hackeado. El incidente deber\u00eda llevarnos a considerar si hay que confiar en las empresas que guardan informaci\u00f3n sensible en la nube.\n\nMientras muchos de nosotros nos est\u00e1bamos desconectando de internet para pasar tiempo con nuestros seres queridos durante las fiestas decembrinas, LastPass, la compa\u00f1\u00eda creadora de un popular programa de seguridad para administrar contrase\u00f1as digitales, entreg\u00f3 el regalo menos deseado. Public\u00f3 detalles sobre un incidente de seguridad reciente en el cual ciberdelincuentes obtuvieron copias de las b\u00f3vedas de contrase\u00f1as de los clientes, lo que potencialmente deja expuesta en l\u00ednea la informaci\u00f3n de millones de personas. Desde la perspectiva de un pirata inform\u00e1tico, esto es como sacarse el premio mayor de la loter\u00eda. Cuando usas un gestor de contrase\u00f1as como LastPass o 1Password, este almacena una lista que contiene todos los nombres de usuario y contrase\u00f1as de los sitios web y las aplicaciones que utilizas, incluidos los de bancos, servicios de salud, correo electr\u00f3nico y cuentas de redes sociales. Lleva el registro de esa lista, llamada la b\u00f3veda, en su nube en l\u00ednea para que tengas acceso f\u00e1cil a tus contrase\u00f1as desde cualquier dispositivo. LastPass dio a conocer que unos hackers robaron copias de la lista de nombres de usuario y contrase\u00f1as de todos los clientes en los servidores de la compa\u00f1\u00eda. Esta infiltraci\u00f3n fue una de las peores cosas que le pueden ocurrir a un producto de seguridad dise\u00f1ado para proteger tus contrase\u00f1as. Sin embargo, adem\u00e1s de la medida obvia a tomar (cambiar todas tus contrase\u00f1as si usaste LastPass), hay lecciones importantes que podemos aprender de esta cat\u00e1strofe, incluyendo que los productos de seguridad no son a prueba de fallas, en especial cuando almacenan nuestros datos delicados en la nube.\n\nPrimero, es importante entender qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3: la compa\u00f1\u00eda afirma que intrusos lograron acceso a su base de datos en la nube y obtuvieron una copia de las b\u00f3vedas de decenas de millones de clientes al usar credenciales y claves robadas a un empleado de LastPass. LastPass, que public\u00f3 detalles sobre el incidente en un blog el 22 de diciembre, intent\u00f3 tranquilizar a sus usuarios asegur\u00e1ndoles que su informaci\u00f3n probablemente estaba segura. Se\u00f1al\u00f3 que algunas partes de las b\u00f3vedas de los usuarios (como las direcciones de los sitios web en los que iniciaban sesi\u00f3n) no estaban cifradas, pero que los datos delicados, incluyendo los nombres de usuarios y las contrase\u00f1as, estaban cifrados. Esto indicar\u00eda que los piratas inform\u00e1ticos podr\u00edan saber el sitio de banca que alguien us\u00f3, pero no tener el nombre de usuario y la contrase\u00f1a requeridos para ingresar a la cuenta de esa persona. Lo m\u00e1s importante, las contrase\u00f1as maestras que los usuarios crearon para desbloquear sus b\u00f3vedas de LastPass tambi\u00e9n estaban cifradas. Eso significa que los hackers tendr\u00edan que descifrar las contrase\u00f1as maestras cifradas para acceder al resto de las contrase\u00f1as en cada b\u00f3veda, lo cual ser\u00eda dif\u00edcil de hacer, si las personas utilizaron una contrase\u00f1a maestra \u00fanica y compleja. Karim Toubba, director ejecutivo de LastPass, no quiso ser entrevistado, pero escribi\u00f3 en una declaraci\u00f3n enviada por correo electr\u00f3nico que el incidente demostr\u00f3 la fortaleza de la arquitectura del sistema de la compa\u00f1\u00eda, que asegur\u00f3 mantuvo datos sensibles de la b\u00f3veda cifrados y seguros. Tambi\u00e9n asever\u00f3 que era responsabilidad de los usuarios \u201cpracticar buenos h\u00e1bitos de contrase\u00f1as\u201d. Muchos expertos en seguridad no estuvieron de acuerdo con el giro optimista que Toubba le dio al incidente y opinaron que todos los usuarios de LastPass deber\u00edan cambiar todas sus contrase\u00f1as.\n\n\u201cEs muy grave\u201d, dijo Sinan Eren, un ejecutivo en Barracuda, una firma de seguridad. \u201cYo considerar\u00eda todas esas contrase\u00f1as administradas como comprometidas\u201d. Casey Ellis, el director de tecnolog\u00eda de la firma de seguridad Bugcrowd, expres\u00f3 que era significativo que los intrusos tuvieran acceso a las listas de las direcciones de los sitios web que las personas usaban. Ellis explic\u00f3: \u201cDigamos que t\u00fa eres mi objetivo. Puedo ver todos los sitios web de los que has guardado informaci\u00f3n y usar eso para planear un ataque. Los datos de todos los usuarios de LastPass est\u00e1n ahora en manos de un adversario\u201d. A continuaci\u00f3n, las lecciones que podemos aprender de esta brecha de seguridad para estar m\u00e1s seguros en l\u00ednea. El incidente de seguridad de LastPass es un recordatorio de que es m\u00e1s sencillo crear salvaguardas para nuestras cuentas m\u00e1s sensibles antes de que ocurra una violaci\u00f3n de seguridad que intentar protegernos a posteriori. A continuaci\u00f3n, algunas de las mejores pr\u00e1cticas que todos debemos seguir con nuestras contrase\u00f1as; cualquier usuario de LastPass que dio estos pasos antes de tiempo habr\u00eda estado relativamente seguro durante este incidente reciente.\n\u2022 None Crea una contrase\u00f1a compleja y \u00fanica para cada cuenta. Una contrase\u00f1a fuerte deber\u00eda ser larga y dif\u00edcil de adivinar. Por ejemplo, emplea estas frases: \u201cMe llamo \u00cd\u00f1igo Montoya. T\u00fa mataste a mi padre. Prep\u00e1rate para morir\u201d. Y convi\u00e9rtelas en esto, al usar la inicial de cada palabra y un punto de exclamaci\u00f3n para las \u00edes: \u201cMl!m.Tmamp.Ppm\u201d. Para aquellos que usan un administrador de contrase\u00f1as, esta regla de oro es de vital importancia para la contrase\u00f1a maestra que da acceso a tu b\u00f3veda. Nunca reutilices esta contrase\u00f1a en ninguna otra aplicaci\u00f3n o sitio web.\n\u2022 None Para tus cuentas m\u00e1s importantes, agrega una capa adicional de seguridad con la autenticaci\u00f3n de dos factores. Para esta configuraci\u00f3n hay que generar un c\u00f3digo temporal que debe ser ingresado, adem\u00e1s de tu nombre de usuario y contrase\u00f1a, antes de que puedas iniciar sesi\u00f3n en tus cuentas. La mayor\u00eda de los sitios de los bancos te dejan configurar tu n\u00famero celular o direcci\u00f3n de correo electr\u00f3nico para recibir un mensaje que contenga un c\u00f3digo temporal para conectarse. Algunas aplicaciones, como Twitter e Instagram, te permiten usar las llamadas aplicaciones de autenticaci\u00f3n como Autenticador de Google y Authy para generar c\u00f3digos temporales. Pero recuerda que no es culpa tuya Aclaremos una cosa importante: siempre que los servidores de cualquier empresa sufren una filtraci\u00f3n y se roban los datos de los clientes, es culpa de la empresa por no protegerte. La respuesta p\u00fablica de LastPass al incidente hace recaer la responsabilidad en el usuario, pero no tenemos por qu\u00e9 aceptarlo. Aunque es cierto que practicar \u201cbuenas pr\u00e1cticas de contrase\u00f1as\u201d habr\u00eda ayudado a mantener una cuenta m\u00e1s segura en caso de brecha, eso no exime a la empresa de su responsabilidad. Aunque el incidente de seguridad de LastPass puede parecer que condena al servicio, los gestores de contrase\u00f1as en general son una herramienta \u00fatil porque hacen m\u00e1s conveniente generar y almacenar contrase\u00f1as \u00fanicas y complejas para nuestras numerosas cuentas de internet.\n\nLa seguridad en internet a menudo involucra sopesar conveniencia contra riesgo. Ellis, de Bugcrowd, manifest\u00f3 que el reto con la seguridad de las contrase\u00f1as era que cuando las mejores pr\u00e1cticas eran demasiado complicadas, la gente se iba por lo que fuera m\u00e1s simple (por ejemplo, usar contrase\u00f1as f\u00e1ciles de adivinar y repetirlas en varios sitios). As\u00ed que no descartes los gestores de contrase\u00f1as. Pero recuerda que la brecha de LastPass demuestra que siempre est\u00e1s tomando un riesgo cuando le conf\u00edas a una compa\u00f1\u00eda que almacene tus datos delicados en su nube, a pesar de lo conveniente que es tener tu b\u00f3veda de contrase\u00f1as accesible desde cualquiera de tus dispositivos. Eren, de Barracuda, recomend\u00f3 no emplear administradores de contrase\u00f1as que almacenen la base de datos en su nube sino, m\u00e1s bien, elegir uno que guarde tu b\u00f3veda de contrase\u00f1as en tus propios dispositivos, como KeePass. Esto nos lleva a mi \u00faltimo consejo, que puede aplicar para cualquier servicio en l\u00ednea: siempre ten un plan para retirarte con tus datos (en este caso, tu b\u00f3veda de contrase\u00f1as) en caso de que algo suceda que te haga desear salirte. Para LastPass, la compa\u00f1\u00eda muestra en su sitio web los pasos para exportar una copia de tu b\u00f3veda a una hoja de c\u00e1lculo. Despu\u00e9s, puedes importar esa lista de contrase\u00f1as a otro gestor de contrase\u00f1as. O puedes conservar el archivo de la hoja de c\u00e1lculo solo para ti, almacenado en alg\u00fan lugar seguro y conveniente para tu uso. Yo adopto un enfoque h\u00edbrido. Uso un gestor de contrase\u00f1as que no almacena mis datos en su nube. En su lugar, guardo mi propia copia de mi b\u00f3veda en mi computadora y en una unidad en la nube que yo mismo controlo. Podr\u00edas hacerlo utilizando un servicio en la nube como iCloud o Dropbox. Esos m\u00e9todos tampoco son infalibles, pero tienen menos probabilidades que la base de datos de una empresa de ser objetivo de los hackers.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nSusan M. Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said she was leaning toward a quarter-point move at the central bank\u2019s Feb. 1 meeting.\n\nSusan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said she was leaning toward a quarter-point interest rate increase at the central bank\u2019s next meeting \u2014 a slowdown that would signal a return to a normal pace of monetary policy adjustment after a year in which officials took rapid action to slow the economy and contain inflation. Fed policymakers raised interest rates to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent in 2022 from near zero, an aggressive path that included four consecutive three-quarter point adjustments. Officials slowed down with a half-point rate move in December, and a few of the Fed\u2019s regional presidents have in recent days suggested that an even smaller adjustment could be possible when the Fed releases its next decision on Feb. 1. Ms. Collins added her voice to that chorus \u2014 but even more declaratively, making it clear that she would at this point support slowing to rate adjustments of 25 basis points, or a quarter point. Changing policy more gradually would give the central bank more time to see how its actions affect the economy and whether they were working to contain rapid inflation. \u201cI think 25 or 50 would be reasonable; I\u2019d lean at this stage to 25, but it\u2019s very data-dependent,\u201d Ms. Collins said in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday. \u201cAdjusting slowly gives more time to assess the incoming data before we make each decision, as we get close to where we\u2019re going to hold. Smaller changes give us more flexibility.\u201d\n\nMs. Collins is one of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional bank presidents and among its 19 policymakers. She does not have a formal vote on rate changes this year, but she will join in deliberations as the decision is made. Ms. Collins said she favored raising interest rates to just above 5 percent this year, potentially in three quarter-point moves in February, March and May. \u201cIf we\u2019ve gone to slower, more judicious rate increases, it could take us three rate increases to get there \u2014 and then holding through the end of 2023, that still seems like a reasonable outlook to me,\u201d she said. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Higher interest rates slow the economy by making it more expensive to borrow money, which weighs on home buying, business expansions and big purchases. But the full effect takes time to play out, so policymakers are conscious that relentlessly driving borrowing costs higher would risk overdoing their policy response: slowing growth more drastically, and leaving more people out of work, than is strictly necessary to restrain inflation. But Fed officials are also worried about underdoing it. They want to make sure that they fully tame today\u2019s rapid inflation, because allowing price increases to remain rapid for too long could cause consumers and businesses to become used to them and adjust their behavior. At that point, inflation would be an entrenched feature of the economy, which could make it much harder to vanquish.\n\nTo strike a balance between the two risks, Fed officials are slowing down interest rate increases but also pledging to keep rates high for some time, hoping that the combination will mitigate the risk of a painful recession while assuring investors and households that Fed policymakers remain serious about combating inflation. \u201cI think of smaller increases as what resolute looks like right now,\u201d Ms. Collins said. Inflation is now beginning to slow as price increases for goods moderate and global supply chains heal. Consumer Price Index data for December, scheduled for release on Thursday, are expected to show that overall inflation stalled last month compared to November, though prices likely continued to climb after stripping out food and fuel costs. Prices overall probably climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier, down from 7.1 percent in November, economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast. But even as inflation slows, returning it fully to the Fed\u2019s target \u2014 which it defines as 2 percent using a separate but related inflation measure \u2014 could be a challenge. Prices for a number of services have been climbing quickly, and central bankers think they could remain stubbornly high as worker shortages prod companies to pay more. Firms are likely to try to pass those price increases along to their customers. That is why Fed officials are looking for signs that the labor market is slowing notably, ones that have so far been elusive. Employers have continued to hire at a rapid clip in recent months, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low and wage growth is unusually robust. Understand Inflation and How It Affects You\n\u2022 None Federal Reserve: Federal Reserve officials kicked off 2023 by grappling with a thorny question: How should central bankers understand inflation Federal Reserve officials kicked off 2023 by grappling with a thorny question: How should central bankers understand inflation after 18 months of repeatedly misjudging it\n\u2022 None Social Security: The cost-of-living adjustment, which helps the benefit keep pace with inflation, is set for 8.7 percent in 2023. The cost-of-living adjustment, which helps the benefit keep pace with inflation, is set for 8.7 percent in 2023. Here is what that means\n\u2022 None Tax Rates: The I.R.S. has made inflation adjustments for 2023, which The I.R.S. has made inflation adjustments for 2023, which could push many people into a lower tax bracket and reduce tax bills\n\u2022 None Your Paycheck: Inflation is taking a bigger and bigger bite out of your wallet. Now, it\u2019s going to Inflation is taking a bigger and bigger bite out of your wallet. Now, it\u2019s going to affect the size of your paycheck in 2023 The current pace of job gains is \u201cclearly above what is sustainable,\u201d Ms. Collins said, explaining that it is important to see the job market slow across a range of measures, from payroll growth to wage gains. But most economists expect a more marked slowdown to take hold in the coming months, and Fed officials are waiting to see if that outlook is realized.\n\nMary Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Ms. Collins\u2019s colleague, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week that either a quarter-point or a half-point rate adjustment would be possible at the upcoming meeting, suggesting that it might be a good idea to slow down. \u201cWhen you\u2019re being seriously data-dependent, doing it in more gradual steps does give you the ability to respond to incoming information and account for those lags,\u201d she said. Ms. Daly does not have a policy vote this year. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and also a nonvoter in 2023, said at a conference last week that a half or three-quarter point move could be on the table, explaining that he was \u201cvery open to both\u201d depending on incoming data. But Fed officials have also emphasized that their fight against inflation isn\u2019t over, and that it is important for investors to understand that, because policy changes trickle out to influence the real economy through financial markets. They have repeatedly underlined that the key to wrangling inflation lies in keeping rates high for a sustained period, not in continuing to rapidly adjust them. \u201cWe\u2019ve really moved into the second phase of our work: The first phase, it was about being aggressive,\u201d Ms. Collins said Wednesday. \u201cNow that we\u2019re in restrictive territory, I continue to believe that what I think of as \u2018judicious\u2019 moves are the right way to get there.\u201d",

Go ahead and let the catalogs\u2019 vivid descriptions and photographs seduce you into trying something unfamiliar. Mr. Schuyler (who goes by Drew) always does. Some of his impulse purchases of annual flowers in recent Januarys have resonated with visitors at Untermyer Gardens Conservancy, the 43-acre public landscape in Yonkers, N.Y., where he is the assistant head gardener. They include the orange-red tassel flowers (Emilia coccinea) that call in autumn\u2019s migrating monarch butterflies. And the four-inch-wide, deep orange zinnias (Zinnia elegans Inca) that called out to an R&B artist who was filming a music video at the garden and snagged one as an impromptu prop.\n\nThe master plan for Untermyer\u2019s extensive display beds, borders and containers had been designed well in advance, with more than 8,000 young plants, or plugs, ordered to match. Then some irresistible oddballs ended up in a shopping cart on a winter whim. But for each happy afterthought, Mr. Schuyler promptly took the next step: He married every impulse with an equal measure of discipline, studying up on exactly how \u2014 and when \u2014 to sow those seeds. \u201cI approach it the way I approach cooking,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is to look at a ton of recipes and then find some middle ground to guide me.\u201d When he saw a catalog photo of purple bell vine (Rhodochiton atrosanguineum), he imagined how it would look cascading out of hanging baskets rather than climbing. Its flowers are extravagant, with an extra-long, maroon-purple clanger dangling from each fuchsia bell; its distinctive leaves are heart shaped, with toothed edges. But the plant was unfamiliar and proved to have particular needs: Both light and warmth are required for germination, and it can sometimes take more than a month for seedlings to emerge. Good to know, or he might have given up on it too soon.\n\nEach acquisition and any secrets revealed \u2014 the ideal sowing depth and temperature requirements, for instance \u2014 make their way onto Mr. Schuyler\u2019s spreadsheet, arranged in order of when the seeds will be sown. Here\u2019s how to calculate that: Subtract the number of weeks each variety requires indoors from when you plan to transplant it into the garden. The earliest possible set-out date is based on how long before or after the final frost a variety can be safely set outside, according to your research. (This online calculator can help.) Open the cheese drawer of the Untermyer staff refrigerator, and you\u2019ll see corresponding evidence of such planning among the packets in cold storage. Multiples are joined by rubber bands, a Post-it note affixed to each little bundle to indicate the intended start date. Cosmos, zinnias, marigolds and Mexican sunflowers (Tithonia rotundifolia), for instance, are marked to get going together on Apr. 1.\n\nSuccessions: Plan Now to Fill Holes Later Growing flowers from seed also empowers the gardener to produce backup seedlings to swap in later, as early plantings tire \u2014 a moment when nurseries are no longer stocking transplants. Don\u2019t expect a flowering annual to carry on from spring through fall any more than you would expect a row of lettuce to, Mr. Schuyler advised. Even the longest bloomers have their limits. \u201cWe think of something like Cosmos as all-summer blooms, but even Cosmos peters out,\u201d he said. \u201cOnes you sow in April are going to be done by August; ones you sow in July will take you to November. This isn\u2019t a one-and-done situation.\u201d\n\nMr. Schuyler cultivated his propagation skills as a student at the Longwood Gardens Professional Horticulture Program, in the Brandywine Valley area of Chester County, Pa. Producing thousands of plants in a large-scale greenhouse setting requires a modular system: Everything at Untermyer Gardens is produced in four-inch pots, with 15 to a flat. Rather than seeding into trays of individual cells, each variety is first sown thickly into one of those pots. It typically grows there until the first true leaves appear, although robust growers may be ready for the next step when they still have only seed leaves, or cotyledons. Then the sturdiest among each thicket of tiny seedlings is moved up to its own pot, a process called pricking out (see the slide show for how-to tips). At home, you could just move each into its own cell.\n\nHow deep should you sow? Research whether a particular seed should be covered or if it needs light for germination. \u201cIf it says it wants light, I\u2019ll just press the seed in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it says cover, I\u2019ll lightly cover.\u201d Sift, don\u2019t smear. Applying an uneven covering of germination mix by hand and spreading it with your fingers risks moving seed into clumps. Use a wire colander instead to sift a layer on top. The finishing touch: A top dressing of granite poultry grit (available at Tractor Supply Company) helps keep the soil surface clean, reducing disease. Is heat required? Varieties that require heat to germinate should go onto an electric heat mat. But remove the seedlings promptly upon germination, or risk weakening them. When watering, think mist, not deluge. \u201cI had a teacher at Longwood who said that you have to keep a \u2018crystalline fairy energy\u2019 in the greenhouse, and I think that\u2019s pretty much the best advice I\u2019ve ever gotten,\u201d Mr. Schuyler said. \u201cJust keep things light; we\u2019re not trying to pummel these seedlings. You just want to mist them.\u201d The Solo 418 one-liter, one-hand sprayer would handle a few flats; in a bigger setting, Mr. Schuyler uses a hose-end mist nozzle, like the Dramm 510.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA decade after the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal health insurance marketplace was created, its outsize \u2014 and improbable \u2014 popularity in South Florida persists.\n\nObamacare Is Everywhere in the Unlikeliest of Places: Miami\n\nMIAMI \u2014 L\u00eddice Hern\u00e1ndez opened an insurance agency last year on a busy street, affixing to the storefront a logo that has become deeply familiar in South Florida: a white sun rising over the red stripes of the American flag, all encased in a big, blue O. Similar displays are common along some of Miami\u2019s main thoroughfares, almost 13 years after President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health policy, the Affordable Care Act, became law and critics branded it with his name. Everywhere you look, especially during the open enrollment period that runs from November to January: Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare. \u201cIf we don\u2019t use it,\u201d Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez explained of the moniker, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know that we sell it.\u201d And in Miami, people really want it. On its face, the program\u2019s outsize popularity in South Florida remains one of its most intriguing data points. The evidence is visible in every Obamacare logo deployed \u2014 not just on storefronts but on trucks, flags and billboards \u2014 to sell health insurance, as agents in the crowded local market jockey to enroll people. This year\u2019s open enrollment period ends on Sunday.\n\nFlorida has far more people enrolled in the federal health insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act than any other state does, a distinction that has been true since 2015. Driving those numbers has been the Miami area, where older, Republican-leaning Hispanics appeared loath to embrace government-subsidized health insurance when the law was enacted. At the time, it ignited some of the most pitched partisan battles in the nation\u2019s recent history. In particular, some Miamians who had fled left-wing leaders in Cuba and other Latin American countries chafed at the law\u2019s requirement \u2014 later eliminated \u2014 that people have health coverage or face a penalty, which critics decried as \u201csocialism.\u201d The region has only tilted more Republican since then, flipping red in the governor\u2019s race last year for the first time in two decades. Yet in 2022, the two ZIP codes with the most enrollees in Affordable Care Act coverage nationwide were in Doral and Hialeah, cities west and north of Miami known for their right-leaning Venezuelan American and Cuban American communities. And the county with most enrollees in the country remained Miami-Dade.\n\nSo is the ubiquitous logo, which got its start as the symbol for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said Sol Sender, who designed it. It was never intended to represent the health care law, Mr. Sender said, calling its co-opting by enterprising insurance agents \u201cjust pretty organic.\u201d\n\u2022 None Obamacare: A decade after the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal health insurance marketplace was created, its outsize and improbable popularity persists in the unlikeliest of places: A decade after the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal health insurance marketplace was created, its outsize and improbable popularity persists in the unlikeliest of places: South Florida\n\u2022 None Drug Costs: Medicare reforms embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act Medicare reforms embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act will bring savings to seniors this year . But some lawmakers are already aiming to repeal the changes.\n\u2022 None Medical Debt: To address the high cost of health care, local governments are turning to the American Rescue Plan to To address the high cost of health care, local governments are turning to the American Rescue Plan to wipe out residents\u2019 medical debt . Experts caution that it is a short-term solution.\n\u2022 None Medicare Advantage: Federal officials are Federal officials are proposing tougher rules for these private plans , in response to complaints that too many claims have been wrongly denied and that marketing of the plans is deceptive. Which is not to say that policyholders, while glad to have coverage, are always happy with their plans. Gisselle Llerena, one of Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s clients said she had been unable to get her insurer to sign off on a test her doctor recommended. \u201cI have an M.R.I. pending from a century ago,\u201d Ms. Llerena, 50, said in Spanish as she recently dropped in on Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s office in a modest strip mall. \u201cBut the insurance doesn\u2019t want to cover it.\u201d Still, Ivan A. Herrera, the chief executive of the Miami-based UniVista Insurance agency, which caters to Hispanic people and prominently advertises Obamacare plans, said he has seen plenty of evidence that the coverage has helped people. \u201cI know customers who have had open-heart surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never went to the doctor. They never had a blood test. They never visited a specialist. And now they can take care of themselves.\u201d Each year, Mr. Herrera\u2019s business has \u201cdoubled the amount of people that we have in Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cObamacare is massive.\u201d\n\nAbout 2.7 million Floridians out of the state\u2019s population of about 22 million enrolled in a plan through the federal insurance marketplace, which the health law created, in 2022. Compared with Texas, which has about 30 million people but only about 1.8 million enrollees, \u201cFlorida is like an A.C.A. monster,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a charity focused on health. The average monthly premium last year for Floridians with marketplace plans was $611, and for those who qualified for federal premium subsidies, the average amount was $552 per month, slightly higher than the national average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy group. Early federal data suggests enrollment has jumped again for 2023, with 15.9 million plan selections nationally in the federal marketplace and those run by states, including almost 3.2 million \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the total \u2014 in Florida. That Obamacare has become part of the fabric of Florida life is also striking given the state\u2019s early opposition to the law, led by Rick Scott, then the Republican governor. Mr. Scott, who is now a U.S. senator, barred \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 those who helped people sign up for coverage \u2014 from state health department offices in an effort to undermine enrollment. The Republican-controlled State Legislature has not expanded Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income people, as allowed under the Affordable Care Act, making Florida one of only 11 holdout states. About 790,000 currently uninsured Floridians would be eligible for expanded Medicaid, according to Kaiser; without it, other low-income residents have turned to the federal marketplace for subsidized coverage, which is one reason Florida has such high enrollment.\n\nObamacare is also popular in the state because it is home to many retirees who are younger than 65 and not yet eligible for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older people. Others opt for the health insurance because they have recently moved from other states and may be in between jobs. And many employers in the state do not offer working Floridians robust benefits that include health care coverage. \u201cIn South Florida especially, you\u2019ve got a lot of people who are working in entertainment or restaurants, where they don\u2019t have an offer of health insurance,\u201d said Karoline Mortensen, an associate dean and professor of health management and policy at the University of Miami. That is especially true for Hispanics, she added. When the federal health insurance mandate lapsed, Dr. Mortensen found that some Latinos dropped their coverage, suggesting that they had gotten insurance only because they were required to. But Hispanic people still continued to get medical care at far higher rates than they had before the federal marketplace was created in 2013, she said. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that Florida is the state with the second-highest percentage of eligible people who have enrolled in an Affordable Care Act plan, said Cynthia Cox, a Kaiser vice president. She credited local leaders and insurance agents with promoting the law\u2019s benefits, even when the state did not. Similarly, Dr. Mortensen referenced a moderate Republican state senator who, when the federal marketplace opened, urged his constituents to enroll. Ilse Torres, an insurance agent in Miami, said she had educated her clients \u201cbit by bit\u201d that Obamacare is not health coverage, as many of them assume, but rather a law that created a federal marketplace and required insurers to cover pre-existing health conditions. After Republicans in Congress tried but failed to repeal the law during the Trump administration, Ms. Torres said, the marketplace stabilized, drawing more major insurers and attracting new policyholders.\n\nMs. Hern\u00e1ndez, who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but later registered as a Republican, lamented that Congress had not updated the Affordable Care Act to make more people permanently eligible for subsidies to help cover their insurance premiums. (Subsidies were temporarily expanded through the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act, and are in effect through 2025 \u2014 a major reason for the recent enrollment bumps.) But she was pleased, she said, that Republican lawmakers had stopped trying to repeal the law. \u201cObamacare needs to be fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I saw how easy it was to get it, I was like, \u2018Oh my God, people don\u2019t know about this. Why don\u2019t more people get it?\u2019\u201d She and her family are now insured through the program.",

            "content": "THE GHOST AT THE FEAST: America and the Collapse of World Order, 1900-1941, by Robert Kagan\n\nRobert Kagan is the most significant writer of the subspecies of the American foreign policy elite that was once notoriously \u2014 and mistakenly \u2014 labeled \u201cneoconservative.\u201d As Kagan has long and justly protested, there is nothing particularly \u201cneo\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d about America\u2019s attempts to shape the world in its image. The founders saw the nation as \u201cHercules in a cradle.\u201d Thomas Jefferson envisioned a vast \u201cempire for liberty.\u201d William Seward declared America\u2019s purpose was \u201cto renovate the condition of mankind.\u201d For decades, Kagan has tried to persuade his countrymen not to forfeit their geopolitical birthright.\n\nIn a series of nimble polemics, and in expansive, finely wrought historical works, Kagan has spun variations on his theme: America\u2019s unfolding purpose is to be the world\u2019s organizing power, it owes this sense of mission to deeply ingrained American ideals, and the chief threat to this will-to-primacy comes not from without, but from within.\n\nA veteran of the Reagan administration, Kagan rose to prominence in the 1990s, when he co-founded the Project for a New American Century, a think tank devoted to the pursuit of \u201cbenevolent global hegemony.\u201d In \u201cParadise and Power,\u201d published in the early months of the second Iraq war, Kagan argued that the United States \u201cmust live by a double standard\u201d: proclaim a rules-based order, but maintain a monopoly on treaty-breaking and violence to advance human progress. By 2012, when U.S. interventionism seemed to be in tatters, Kagan was determined to stay the course. In \u201cThe World America Made,\u201d Kagan argued that America was not in decline, but in denial. He gamely advanced what some have called the George Bailey doctrine: When the \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d protagonist tours a world without him, he encounters a hellscape. America, for Kagan, is the Jimmy Stewart of the world order: If it isn\u2019t there, then \u2014 as the title of Kagan\u2019s last book delicately phrased it \u2014 \u201cthe jungle grows back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ghost at the Feast\u201d is the second volume of a projected trilogy. The first, \u201cDangerous Nation\u201d (2006), focused on the United States getting its own continent in order. The new book spans the era between 1898 and 1941. As the 19th century drew to a close, Kagan writes, \u201cAmericans had no grand international plan and no clear direction.\u201d Other nations were taken aback by how faintly American power registered in their world \u2014 \u201cthe ghost at all our feasts,\u201d per the British diplomat Harold Nicolson. The Spanish-American War is conventionally considered America\u2019s imperial turn, when it acquired its first colony, fought Indigenous rebels overseas and decided, in the words of William James, \u201cto puke up its ancient soul \u2026 in five minutes without a hint of squeamishness.\u201d For Kagan, it was a far more wholesome affair. Business interests in the United States were against the war; the most ardent backers of the interventions were the self-identifying \u201cpopulists.\u201d For Kagan, it is crucial to show that America\u2019s early adventures abroad were not elite conspiracies, but moral undertakings with broad popular support. The United States may not have become a world power in 1898, Kagan claims, but the nation did become more conscious of its capacities.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHanwha Qcells expects to make solar panels and their components in the United States to take advantage of President Biden\u2019s climate policies.\n\nThe climate and tax bill President Biden signed in August to increase the use of green energy and electric cars while expanding domestic manufacturing appears to be yielding some results. A Korean solar company, Hanwha Qcells, announced on Wednesday that it would spend $2.5 billion to build a large manufacturing complex in Georgia. The plant will produce critical components for solar panels and build complete panels. If realized, the company\u2019s plans could bring some of the supply chain for solar energy, which is largely based in China, to the United States. Qcells, which has its headquarters in Seoul, said it was making the investment to take advantage of tax credits and other benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act, the law Mr. Biden signed last summer. The manufacturing complex is expected to create 2,500 jobs in Cartersville, Ga., roughly 50 miles northwest of Atlanta, and at an existing plant in Dalton, Ga. Production at the new plant is expected to start in 2024. The company opened its first solar panel manufacturing plant in Georgia in 2019, quickly becoming one of the largest U.S. producers \u2014 by the end of last year, it was cranking out 12,000 panels a day. The company said its new complex would increase its capacity to 60,000 panels a day.\n\n\u201cAs demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we\u2019re ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American-made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels,\u201d Justin Lee, chief executive of Qcells, said in a statement. Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia, and the state\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, have aggressively courted renewable energy, battery and automotive companies to the state. Several of those investments have come from South Korea, including a planned electric vehicle plant by Hyundai.\n\n\u201cWith a focus on innovation and technology, Georgia continues to set itself apart as the No. 1 state for business,\u201d Mr. Kemp said in a statement. In 2021, Mr. Ossoff introduced a bill, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, that would have provided tax incentives to solar manufacturers. The bill was later incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nUnder the legislation, businesses receive a tax credit at every stage of the supply chain. The act includes an estimated $30 billion in production tax credits to accelerate manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and for the processing of critical minerals. The law also offers an investment tax credit to companies that build factories that produce electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process. Those and other provisions are intended to reduce reliance on China, which dominates the supply chain for crucial raw materials and components for batteries and solar panels. In addition to the fear that the United States was losing ground in important technologies, lawmakers have also been concerned that some Chinese producers are using forced labor. \u201cI wrote and passed into law legislation precisely intended to attract this type of manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest solar manufacturing in U.S. history coming to Georgia. This economic and geostrategic competition will continue, but my law has brought the United States back into the fight to secure our energy independence.\u201d Lawmakers and administrations from both parties have long sought to boost a domestic solar manufacturing industry, including by imposing tariffs and other restrictions on imported solar panels. But such efforts have, so far, achieved only modest results. Most of the solar panels installed in the United States are imported. The new plant \u201cwill bring back our supply chains so we aren\u2019t reliant on other countries, lower the cost of clean energy, and help us combat the climate crisis,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement. \u201cAnd, it will ensure that we manufacture cutting-edge, solar technology here at home.\u201d The Qcells project and others could reduce U.S. reliance on imports, but not quickly. China and other Asian countries have had a huge head start in assembling panels and producing the parts that go into them. Governments there have also used subsidies, energy policy, trade agreements and other tactics to help domestic producers. While the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred new investment, it has also raised tensions between the Biden administration and U.S. allies like France and South Korea.\n\nFor example, the law offers tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric cars, but it is only available on vehicles made in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Consumers seeking to buy models made by Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia would not be eligible for at least two years until the company\u2019s new Georgia plant begins production in 2025. Still, energy and auto executives have said that on the whole, the legislation should benefit their businesses, which struggled to get important parts when the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine wrecked global supply chains. Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition, said he expected more companies to announce plans for new solar equipment factories in the United States in the first six months of the year. His group estimates that between 2030 and 2040, U.S. plants will be able to meet all of the country\u2019s demand for solar panels. \u201cWe see this in the medium to longer term as a very, very large contributor to lower prices in the United States,\u201d Mr. Carr said referring to the cost of panels. Several other solar companies have announced new U.S. manufacturing plants in recent months, including CubicPV, a start-up backed by Bill Gates that plans to begin production of solar panel components in 2025. Another company, First Solar, said in August that it would build its fourth panel manufacturing plant in the United States. First Solar plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its operations and add 1,000 jobs.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn assailant injured six people with what French authorities described as a sharpened metal hook. The motive was not immediately clear.\n\nA man went on a violent, unprovoked stabbing spree on Wednesday at the Gare du Nord in Paris, injuring six people and causing brief panic at one of Europe\u2019s busiest train stations until he was shot and arrested by the police. Investigators were not immediately able to identity the suspect, who attacked his victims with a metal hook, and the motive for his assault was not clear, the French authorities said. But none of the injuries were expected to be life-threatening, and the episode was not currently being treating as a terrorist attack. G\u00e9rald Darmanin, the French interior minister, told reporters at the station that at 6:42 a.m., an \u201cextremely threatening individual\u201d had stabbed several bystanders in front of the station before continuing inside, during the busy commuter rush. The assault was sudden, random and extremely violent, according to Laure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, who said in a statement on Wednesday evening that the suspect had stabbed his first victim at least 20 times with a metal hook that had been sharpened and wrapped with string, \u201callowing a better grip.\u201d\n\nBorder police officers who were stationed at the Gare du Nord, as well as off-duty officers who were armed and present, responded within a minute, Mr. Darmanin said. Two of the police officers fired three shots at the suspect and subdued him, he said. The suspect was arrested and hospitalized with serious injuries and has not yet been questioned by police, according to Ms. Beccuau, who has opened a criminal investigation for attempted murder. The attack injured six people: two men and three women ages 36 to 53, and one of the border police officers. Five of the victims were slightly wounded, and the sixth sustained more serious injuries, but his life was not in danger, Ms. Beccuau said. Gare du Nord, in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, is one of the largest transit hubs in the French capital, with service to northern France and beyond, along with a Eurostar terminal for travelers heading to Britain. It is used by over 220 million people every year, according to official statistics. \u201cWithout the extremely fast police response there would certainly have been deaths,\u201d Mr. Darmanin said at the station, which the police partly cordoned off for much of Wednesday but was otherwise functioning normally.\n\nOne witness, identified only as Lilie, told RTL radio that she was near the assailant when he started to attack two people, causing immediate panic. \u201cEveryone started to run all over the place and to shout,\u201d she said. \u201cOthers tried to subdue the man, but he seemed very aggressive and attacked anyone who tried to stop him.\u201d \u201cWe were shaken,\u201d she said of her experience. \u201cWhen you think about it, it could have been us, because were just two meters away.\u201d Ms. Beccuau said that investigators had not been able to fully identify the suspect, who was shot twice in the chest and once in his right arm and was still being operated on as of Wednesday night. She said that his fingerprints had matched several aliases recorded in police databases, but she did not provide any details about a criminal record. He appeared to be in his 20s and to have been born either in Libya or in Algeria, Ms. Beccuau said, but she did not confirm or comment on French news reports, citing anonymous sources, that said he had been ordered to leave the country last summer. The French government has come under pressure in recent months over the issue of foreigners who commit crimes in France even though they are under deportation orders. In October, the killing of a 12-year-old schoolgirl fueled outrage, especially on the right, after the main suspect was identified as an Algerian woman who had been ordered to leave France. France was struck by large-scale Islamist terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016, followed by a string of smaller but still deadly shootings and stabbings in subsequent years, often carried out by lone assailants. While terrorist attacks have receded from the headlines in France, the country is still on high alert and the authorities say that the police and intelligence services regularly foil plots. Mr. Darmanin said last month that the authorities had thwarted 39 Islamist attacks and nine far-right attacks since 2017.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nKashmir\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, he gave voice to the rich culture of a bitterly divided territory and helped give his mother tongue a distinct literary identity.\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Rehman Rahi, a celebrated Kashmiri poet who devoted his life to promoting and preserving the Kashmiri language and gave its poetry a distinct identity, died on Monday at his home in Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s biggest city. He was 97. Throughout his career as a writer and university professor, Mr. Rahi was committed to Kashmiri, a language he considered the source of Kashmiri identity and essential for preserving the ancient culture of a divided territory. He published more than a dozen books of poetry and prose in Kashmiri and is credited with restoring the language spoken by more than six million people to the realm of literature, lifting it out of the shadow of Persian and Urdu, which once dominated the literary scene in Kashmir, a disputed territory that straddles India and Pakistan. \u201cHe introduced intellectual richness, modern sensibility and accessibility to Kashmiri language and poetry,\u201d Muhammad Amin Bhat, a Kashmiri television anchor and president of Adbee Markaz Kamraz, the region\u2019s oldest literary organization, said in an interview this week. \u201cWithout a doubt, he was the greatest living poet of modern Kashmiri language.\u201d\n\nOver a career that spanned many decades, Mr. Rahi won dozens of awards, including the Padma Shri, India\u2019s fourth-highest civilian honor, in 2000, and in 2007 the Jnanpith Award, India\u2019s top literary prize, becoming the first Kashmiri to do so. In 1961, he won a literary award from India\u2019s National Academy of Letters, for his poetry anthology \u201cNawroz-i-Saba\u201d or \u201cAdvent of the Spring Breeze,\u201d (1958). Like most Kashmiris, Mr. Rahi grew up speaking conversational Kashmiri, but the language had been removed from schools \u2014 the Indian government viewed it as subversive \u2014 and its formal speech had fallen into disuse. In the 1950s, he attended a poetry reading in the village of Raithan in central Kashmir, where a Kashmiri poem was greeted with tremendous applause. Mr. Rahi then went onstage and read his work in Urdu, then the region\u2019s official language. \u201cNo one understood it,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times last year. \u201cThat day I started learning Kashmiri.\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of his long love affair with the language, which he described in his 1966 poem \u201cHymn to a Language\u201d: O Kashmiri language!\n\nI swear by you,\n\nyou are my awareness,\n\nmy vision too the radiant ray of my perception\n\nthe whirling violin of my conscience! He also promoted Kashmiri in more concrete ways. He was one of the biggest supporters of a campaign to restore the language to schools, an effort that finally succeeded in 2000. He helped recruit teachers and scholars to teach Kashmiri and created a course to teach it to children. More recently, his poems addressed the despair of the Kashmiri people living at the heart of a bitter and longstanding dispute between India and Pakistan. It may not be possible to speak, what can we do?\n\nIt may not be possible to bear burdens of the heart, what can we do?\n\nThe flower may refuse to blossom but does it have the right?\n\nThere is a fire burning in its bosom, what can we do? Rehman Rahi was born Abdul Rehman Mir on May 6, 1925, into a poor Muslim family in the Wazpora area of the city of Srinagar. His father, Ghulam Muhammad Mir, a day laborer, died when Rehman was 14; his mother, Rahat Begum, was a homemaker. After the death of his father, he was raised by a maternal uncle. Rehman studied Persian at Sri Pratap College and English at Kashmir University, both in Srinagar, earning a master\u2019s degree in each language. He started writing while in college, adopting the pen name Rehman Rahi. He worked briefly as a clerk in the department of Public Works, earning just a few cents a month and sometimes traveling dozens of miles to northern Kashmir for his job. He then joined a regional Urdu-language newspaper, Khidmat, as an opinion writer. In 1947, the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into India and Pakistan, leading to widespread violence between Muslims and Hindus and cleaving what had been the princely state of Kashmir.\n\nFor years, Mr. Rahi wrote about the pain and anguish that the upheaval had inflicted on millions of ordinary people and how it had shaped their experiences and encounters. He also started writing poetry. In 1964, he joined the Persian department of Kashmir University as a lecturer, and in 1979 switched to the recently created Kashmiri department. He married Zareena Mir, who died in 2019. Along with his son, Dr. Ahmad, Mr. Rahi is survived by two other sons, Dr. Javed Iqbal and Dr. Farhad Hussain; a daughter, Nighat Nowsheen; and five grandchildren. He retired from the university in 1985. Mr. Rahi was sometimes criticized for having failed to engage with the brutal conditions faced by many Kashmiris, who have been oppressed by both Indian security forces and Kashmiri militants fighting for independence from India. While working for the newspaper Khidmat, he joined the Progressive Writer\u2019s Association, which was affiliated with India\u2019s Communist Party, and early in his career he had a reputation as a progressive poet. But he later denounced Communism and became more guarded about his political thinking. As Kashmir plunged deeper into turmoil after an insurgency began in 1989, Mr. Rahi\u2019s poetry grew more somber, expressing anguish over the mounting violence, yet he continued to avoid addressing the politics around it. He saw literary modernism as a new framework for examining the human condition. Abir Bazaz, a professor of Kashmiri literature at Ashoka University, outside of New Delhi, said Mr. Rahi\u2019s reticence had been a valid response to the conflict.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe companies, which mainly served the Orthodox Jewish community, billed the government for services that they never provided, federal prosecutors said.\n\nA man who has operated at least four Brooklyn education companies billed the government for more than $1 million in child care services that he never provided, cashing in on programs meant to aid low-income families, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Wednesday. The executive, Martin Handler, 48, was arrested Wednesday and charged with theft of government funds and wire fraud conspiracy, among other crimes. Also charged were four of his partners, including his younger brother. In a yearslong fraud, Mr. Handler and a co-defendant stole about $2.8 million through companies, some of them secretly owned, overbilling and using the proceeds to dole out no-show jobs, purchase real estate and buy an array of historical religious artifacts at auctions, prosecutors said. Mr. Handler runs several companies that primarily serve Orthodox Jewish children, including in the fervently religious Hasidic community. In addition to child care companies, he also operates firms that are among the top-earning providers of special education services in Jewish religious schools, known as yeshivas. In all, his education companies have received tens of millions of dollars in government funding annually.\n\n\u201cThe defendants brazenly participated in schemes that stole from programs meant to benefit society\u2019s most vulnerable members,\u201d said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. \u201cTheir schemes used children as currency.\u201d State law requires all private schools to provide an education comparable to what is in public schools. In 2015, New York City\u2019s education department said it would investigate complaints about the quality of secular education in schools in the Hasidic Jewish community. Here\u2019s a timeline of the investigation: July 2015: Graduates of Hasidic religious schools, known as yeshivas, wrote a complaint about the poor secular education they received. Then-Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration opened an investigation into the schools, but it soon stalled, plagued by delays and a lack of cooperation from the yeshivas. November 2018: The state released updated rules outlining what nonpublic schools like yeshivas must teach and for how long \u2013 with consequences for schools that did not comply. Hasidic leaders sued, and the rules were thrown out in court in 2019. December 2019: The city Department of Investigation found the de Blasio administration delayed a report on the schools. A few days later, the city finally released findings: only two of 28 yeshivas that officials visited were offering a basic secular education. The investigation has not concluded, and the city has done little to follow up. Sept. 11, 2022: A New York Times investigation found scores of schools are systematically denying children a basic education, a violation of state law that has trapped generations of students in a cycle of joblessness and destitution. Even so, The Times found, these institutions have collected more than $1 billion from city, state and federal sources in the past four years alone. Sept. 13, 2022: The State Board of Regents voted unanimously to approve rules that would force Hasidic yeshivas and other private schools to prove they are offering basic secular instruction. The vote came after four years of tumultuous debate about how the government should regulate the schools. Oct. 6, 2022: The New York education commissioner ruled that a large boys' yeshiva in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is violating state law by failing to provide a basic secular education. This is the first time the state has taken action against a Hasidic boys' school. New York City had earlier recommended the school be found in compliance with the law. Oct. 24, 2022: The operators of the largest private Hasidic school in New York State admitted to diverting millions of dollars from government programs in a widespread fraud scheme, paying teachers off the books and receiving reimbursement for student meals that they never actually provided. The case is being handled by the public corruption unit of Mr. Williams\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Handler pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, as did his co-defendants, said his lawyer, Gedalia M. Stern. \u201cThe government has many of the facts in the indictment wrong, and Mr. Handler looks forward to demonstrating that,\u201d he added. For years, Mr. Handler has also been one of the top-earning special education providers in New York City private schools. His special education companies received about $17 million last year, records show. The companies were among the organizations described in a New York Times investigation last month that found that special education providers in the Orthodox and Hasidic communities had received a windfall of taxpayer money for services that were sometimes not needed, or even provided.\n\nThe Times had reported in September that scores of Hasidic boys\u2019 yeshivas in Brooklyn and the lower Hudson Valley have collected about $1 billion in taxpayer money in recent years while failing to provide a basic secular education. The alleged fraud involving the child care companies began several years ago, when Mr. Handler, who was then the executive director of a nonprofit day care company that provided services all across the city, secretly acquired the company and then used it to fraudulently bill the government, according to the indictment. At that day care center, Mr. Handler and some of his partners created a \u201cfake after-school program\u201d that sought reimbursement for caring for children who were not actually enrolled, prosecutors said. Mr. Handler also opened another company and created a partnership between the two, lying to the government about it, according to the indictment. Mr. Handler also funneled about $118,050 monthly to pay off a loan that he took from a business partner, a co-defendant in the case, prosecutors said. Mr. Handler gave the partner\u2019s wife and grandson no-show jobs with salaries of $90,000 in total and bought the partner\u2019s wife a luxury sport utility vehicle, prosecutors said. The indictment said that the government is seeking to have Mr. Handler forfeit seven properties across Brooklyn, Staten Island, the lower Hudson Valley and south Florida, as well as several religious items, including a copy of a book personally inscribed by a prominent Talmudic scholar in the 1700s, along with a booklet dating from nineteenth-century Baghdad and a list of blessings printed by silk-weavers in sixteenth-century Bologna, Italy. The announcement on Wednesday marked the second time in recent months that federal prosecutors have taken aim at Orthodox and Hasidic education providers. In October, the state\u2019s largest Hasidic boys\u2019 yeshiva, the Central United Talmudical Academy, in Williamsburg, admitted to illegally diverting millions of dollars from government programs as part of a deal to avoid federal prosecution.\n\nAt least one of Mr. Handler\u2019s special education companies, Kids Domain, provides services at that school. Mr. Handler acquired another one of his companies, Special Education Associates, in 2012 after its former owner pleaded guilty to defrauding the government. In recent years, that firm has been sued several times in lawsuits that have accused it of discriminating against women and not paying its rent and other bills. Kids Domain and Special Education Associates are both run from the same building in Borough Park, Brooklyn, where Mr. Handler\u2019s child care businesses were also located. While all the companies are supposed to operate independently, two former employees told The Times last month that students attending the preschool programs were sometimes urged to seek services from the special education companies, regardless of whether they needed them.",

            "content": "The big factor depressing attendance this year was Covid, which had two effects, one temporary and one most likely permanent. The temporary way is that some people stayed away from New Orleans because they were sick with Covid or were worried about catching it.\n\nThe possibly permanent change is that during the two years the conference wasn\u2019t held live, one of its important functions fell away. It used to be that about 1,500 Ph.D. candidates would attend to look for jobs and about 2,000 professors would come to interview them, in hotel suites. Now those initial interviews are happening online by video, and no one seems interested in going back to the old way, which was inconvenient for all and uncomfortable for many female candidates. (Another depressant this year is that some economists stayed away in protest of Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban, which was triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade.)\n\nThe question people were asking one another in New Orleans is whether the event can survive without what for many was its reason for being: hiring. At the beginning of the weekend I was worried, but by the end I started to be reassured. Susan Athey, an economist at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business and the president of the American Economic Association, told me she\u2019s predicting that attendance next year in San Antonio will be slightly higher than it was in New Orleans, \u201cbased on the positive experiences people had being back in person and further improvements suggested by members for next year.\u201d\n\nBreadth and depth matter, the new president said. There are plenty of smaller, narrower economic conferences, but if you want to learn about topics outside your specialty or catch up with old colleagues who have gone in other directions, there\u2019s nothing better than the annual A.S.S.A. meeting, said Athey, who is also chief economist of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice.\n\nDaron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told me he enjoyed this year\u2019s meeting more than past ones because he was able to participate in more sessions instead of interviewing grad students all weekend. He said the current level of attendance might be more or less the new steady state. Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, said the most important part of the conference is the serendipitous hallway conversations.",

            "description": "As a professor of criminology and a former F.B.I. special agent, I am frequently surprised by the misperceptions of what criminologists study. ",
            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Dr. Fox is an associate professor in the criminology department at the University of South Florida, a co-director of the U.S.F. Center for Justice Research & Policy and a former F.B.I. special agent.\n\nCrime is a constant in American life. We see it portrayed on television and in films, see it debated in the media and by politicians, and unfortunately some of us experience it in our lives. Criminology, the scientific study of the causes, impact and prevention of crime, is, by contrast, a little-known field. While it is a relatively young discipline, it has become a fast-growing academic field, with American colleges awarding over 11,000 degrees in criminology during the 2020-21 school year alone. With the recent murders of four young students at the University of Idaho and the arrest of a suspect, Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student in criminology at Washington State University, questions have been raised about his choice of educational discipline \u2014 and whether his decision to research the psychology of criminal decision-making may have been some kind of omen. Was Mr. Kohberger studying criminology to learn how to commit a crime? There are thousands of criminologists in the United States, and I\u2019m not aware of a single one who has ever been accused of committing a heinous crime like this.\n\nAs a professor of criminology and a former F.B.I. special agent, I am frequently surprised by the misperceptions of what criminologists study and what we train our students to do. Many people assume that criminologists are experts in profiling serial killers, forensic analysis, solving cold cases and other \u201ctrue crime\u201d topics. While we are often asked to opine on high-profile crimes because of our expertise in criminal behavior and the workings of the criminal justice system, most criminologists\u2019 work focuses on developing and testing theories of criminal behavior and applying rigorous scientific methods to develop evidence-based policies and programs for the police, prosecutors, social workers and other criminal justice practitioners to use to better prevent and reduce crime. In other words, our field is dedicated to developing better policies and practices to prevent crime. It is not focused on serial killers or forensics, as most people may think. If Mr. Kohberger was trying to improve his ability to commit or get away with the killings he is accused of, there were easier and better ways to do so than to spend tens of thousands of dollars, go through years of advanced studies and conduct the sophisticated research required for a doctoral degree in criminology. Also, if he did commit these crimes, ostensibly helped by his criminological research, why were such basic mistakes made, such as, according to a police affidavit, leaving behind clues including a knife sheath with his DNA at the crime scene and cellphone tower records? Mr. Kohberger\u2019s interest in criminal decision-making is another red herring. A study I recently conducted on the perceived risk of being caught after committing a crime showed that aspiring criminologists, such as Mr. Kohberger, are actually poor judges of true apprehension risk, worse than the general public, jail inmates and prolific violent offenders. In fact, criminology students routinely overestimate the risk of apprehension by large margins as compared with actual risk, likely contributing to their tendency to not engage in crime. If criminologists had insight into how to offend more effectively, evade law enforcement or otherwise reduce the risk of being caught for a serious crime, the data from criminology students would indicate as such. But that just isn\u2019t the case. Some of the confusion around the study of criminology, I believe, is rooted in the \u201c\u2018C.S.I.\u2019 effect\u201d: the unrealistic expectation of forensics and criminal investigations that became widespread after the \u201cC.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d television series became popular in the early 2000s. Despite \u201cC.S.I.\u201d being science fiction \u2014 one forensic scientist has estimated that 40 percent of the science depicted on the show is completely made up \u2014 research shows that the show has an impact on how the public perceives crime and forensics, the evidence jurors expect to see in order to deliver a guilty verdict in court, how the police and prosecutors handle cases and even how offenders attempt to cover up their crimes.\n\nThe \u201cC.S.I.\u201d effect is exemplified in a 2008 National Institute of Justice publication in which a juror complained that the police did not do a thorough job because \u201cthey didn\u2019t even dust the lawn for fingerprints\u201d and a prosecutor lamented that jurors expect \u201cthe most advanced technology possible, and they expect it to look like it does on television.\u201d Other television shows, such as \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d and \u201cMindhunter,\u201d have similarly led the public to believe that criminologists are all criminal profilers when in reality profilers are an extremely small segment of the larger discipline. The gap between fact and fiction seems to have expanded to have an impact on public perceptions of criminology now, too. If anything, criminology is one of the reasons we\u2019ve had so many breakthroughs that have led to declines in rates of both crime and incarceration, innovation in policing and crime prevention, and a reduction in systemic disparities in the criminal justice system. While I valued my experience as a special agent in the F.B.I., I quickly realized that crime was hardly affected by law enforcement\u2019s reactive efforts, and only by studying the causes of crime, and proactively intervening on them, could I make a real change in the world. This is what criminologists like myself aim to do every day. One thing I\u2019ve learned through more than a decade of research and my time in the F.B.I. is that some people are capable of doing horrible things that most of us could never stomach. This almost never has anything to do with their chosen field of study, employment, marital status, intellect or many other features that society often cites to make sense of why certain people do heinous things. We try to make sense of tragedy because we often feel that doing so will allow us to regain control in our lives and prevent future tragedy from occurring to us. In this case, it might make us feel safer to believe that something overt, such as someone\u2019s field of study, is a red flag for extreme violence, as opposed to, say, a personality feature that is difficult to detect. This leads us to think that we can identify a person with an aptitude to commit such a crime and prevent the individual from victimizing us. The field of criminology aims to identify the complex latent risk factors for crime and develop more effective and efficient ways to address them. As we learn more about Bryan Kohberger in the coming months, we will be confronted by the complex set of factors that could have contributed to him allegedly committing these crimes. This is the exact reason we need criminology \u2014 to study these factors and develop responsive interventions and prevention strategies so we can stop more crimes from occurring in the future.",

A hurricane in November is rare, but Mr. Jones could read the signs: A powerful storm was forming. After all, as a meteorologist at The New York Times, it\u2019s what he was hired to do.\n\nMr. Jones spoke to his boss, John Keefe, the lead editor of the Weather Data team, a group formed last year that is focused on covering extreme weather events. \u201cI think we need to write this story,\u201d Mr. Jones recalled telling Mr. Keefe. \u201cThis is really happening.\u201d\n\nSo the Weather Data team, in close collaboration with The Times\u2019s Graphics desk, began working on an interactive article, with maps and rainfall forecasts, that would track the progress of the system as it raced across the Atlantic, then turned into Hurricane Nicole by the time it hit the Bahamas. On Nov. 10, Nicole became the first hurricane to come ashore on Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast since Katrina in 2005.\n\nWeather has always been part of The Times\u2019s coverage. Short forecasts have appeared on the front page since 1897. In recent years, interactive features, such as The Upshot\u2019s probability-based snow forecast and the Graphics desk\u2019s seasonal wildfire tracker, have offered readers more immersive weather reporting.",

            "content": "The first-year Republican lawmaker, representing parts of Queens and Long Island, admitted to lying about his background, education and finances.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRepublican officials in New York sharply denounced the embattled representative, even as leaders in Washington have said they will not push him to step down.\n\nWESTBURY, N.Y. \u2014 Dozens of Republican officials in New York State, including four recently elected congressmen, urged Representative George Santos to resign on Wednesday in a fracturing of local party support for Mr. Santos. Their call represented a sharp break from congressional Republican leaders, who insisted they would not push the embattled congressman to resign. Even as Mr. Santos\u2019s former allies in New York insisted that his fabrications on the campaign trail had significantly violated the public trust, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that he not only would resist calls to push Mr. Santos out, but that he planned to seat him on a congressional committee. \u201cThe voters elected him to serve,\u201d Mr. McCarthy told reporters in Washington, adding that Mr. Santos \u201chas to answer to the voters and the voters can make another decision in two years.\u201d Mr. Santos, who was elected to represent New York\u2019s Third Congressional District, a consequential swing district in Queens and Long Island, emphatically resisted calls to leave office, saying on Twitter that he remained committed to serving the people of his district.\n\nBut at a news conference, Representative Anthony D\u2019Esposito, whose district neighbors Mr. Santos\u2019s, said that Mr. Santos had so deeply lost the faith of voters on Long Island that he did \u201cnot have the ability\u201d to adequately serve in the House of Representatives. Mr. D\u2019Esposito, who joined the event via video from his office in Washington, added in a statement that he would not associate with Mr. Santos and would encourage \u201cother representatives in the House of Representatives to join me in rejecting him.\u201d In the hours that followed, three other first-term Republican congressmen joined the push: Nick LaLota, who also represents parts of Long Island; Nick Langworthy, the state Republican chair whose district is in New York\u2019s rural Southern Tier; and Brandon Williams, whose district covers an area near Syracuse.\n\u2022 None An Investor\u2019s Experience: Andrew Intrater, a wealthy businessman, Andrew Intrater, a wealthy businessman, has been in touch with the Securities and Exchange Commission about Representative George Santos\u2019s dealings with a company accused in a Ponzi scheme.\n\u2022 None Tilting to the Hard Right: Mr. Santos\u2019s actions in and out of the House chamber so far this year suggest that his stance in Congress Mr. Santos\u2019s actions in and out of the House chamber so far this year suggest that his stance in Congress will be further to the right than the one he adopted on the campaign trail.\n\u2022 None Clothes Make the Con Man: To look the part he conceived for himself, Mr. Santos went deep into the costume department of the popular culture hive mind and To look the part he conceived for himself, Mr. Santos went deep into the costume department of the popular culture hive mind and built his cover story garment by garment\n\u2022 None Holes in the Gate-Keeping System: Interviews and documents obtained by The Times show that Interviews and documents obtained by The Times show that some Republicans had indications far earlier than the public did that Mr. Santos was spinning an elaborate web of deceits. The calls for Mr. Santos to step down were the sharpest denunciation yet of the congressman\u2019s behavior from Republicans after reporting in The New York Times uncovered that Mr. Santos had made false claims about his educational and professional background and raised questions about his business, his financial disclosures and his campaign expenses. The Nassau County party chairman, Joseph G. Cairo Jr., said that Mr. Santos, a first-term Republican, had lost the support of Republicans in his district, saying that Mr. Santos\u2019s campaign was one of \u201cdeceit, lies, fabrication.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s disgraced the House of Representatives, and we do not consider him one of our congresspeople,\u201d Mr. Cairo said at the news conference. \u201cToday, on behalf of the Nassau County Republican Committee, I am calling for his immediate resignation.\u201d Leaders outlined a scenario in which Mr. Santos would be cut out of the day-to-day functioning of local government, barring him from local meetings and events. Constituents of his with requests would be referred to other representatives. While such moves would hamper Mr. Santos\u2019s reach, they could also curtail basic constituent access and potentially hinder the government\u2019s ability to address local needs. In response, Mr. Santos said on Twitter that he was committed to serving his constituents, \u201cnot the party & politicians.\u201d He added that he regretted hearing that Long Island officials would \u201crefuse to work with my office to deliver results to keep our community safe and lower the cost of living.\u201d The unified outcry from Nassau County Republicans adds to the pressure facing Mr. Santos, who is currently the subject of inquiries by federal and local prosecutors over whether his financial dealings or lies on the campaign trail warrant criminal charges.\n\nThis week alone, Mr. Santos, 34, has been the subject of two formal ethics complaints. On Tuesday, two Democratic lawmakers filed a formal complaint asking the House\u2019s bipartisan Committee on Ethics to investigate whether Mr. Santos ran afoul of the law when he filed his required financial disclosures late and without key details about his bank accounts and business. A day earlier, a watchdog group, the Campaign Legal Center, called on the Federal Election Commission to investigate the congressman, accusing him of improperly using campaign funds for personal expenses, misrepresenting his spending and hiding the true sources of his campaign money.\n\nBrazilian law enforcement officials have also said they intended to revive fraud charges against Mr. Santos tied to a 2008 incident involving a stolen checkbook, after the case was disclosed in The Times\u2019s report. The calls by Mr. D\u2019Esposito, Mr. LaLota, Mr. Langworthy and Mr. Williams for Mr. Santos\u2019s resignation could create a lane for other Republican House members to join them, though none did so immediately. The party holds a slim majority in the House, giving it little political incentive for pushing Mr. Santos to step down. Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado, said he believed Mr. Santos\u2019s actions were wrong. But he blamed Democrats for failing to raise concerns about Mr. Santos before his election and said there was little chance of removing him from Congress now. \u201cIf the Democrats had done their research and exposed things, the voters would have had more information,\u201d Mr. Buck said. \u201cI think what he did was wrong, but whether he gets a committee assignment is up to Kevin,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. McCarthy. Mr. Santos\u2019s committee assignment remained unclear on Wednesday, but he did not receive a spot he coveted on the House Committee on Financial Services. Mr. McCarthy had said earlier in the day that Mr. Santos would not get a spot on choice committees. In the weeks after The Times\u2019s story, Mr. McCarthy largely remained silent about the ongoing controversy, including reports by CNBC and The Washington Times that someone working with Mr. Santos\u2019s campaign impersonated Mr. McCarthy\u2019s chief of staff in order to raise money from donors. Mr. Santos supported Mr. McCarthy in his protracted fight to become speaker last week.\n\nWere Mr. Santos\u2019s seat to become vacant, a special election would be held to fill it. Mr. Cairo said it was too early to speculate whether his party had potential candidates in mind. Mr. Cairo\u2019s rebuke, in particular, represents a significant break between Mr. Santos and an organization that was integral in helping the congressman secure his seat, which covers a large swath of Nassau County and a much smaller section of northeast Queens. Mr. Cairo was among roughly 30 local and federal Republicans who attended the news conference to castigate Mr. Santos and call for his resignation. The Nassau Republican Committee confirmed that it had refunded the more than $120,000 that funds associated with Mr. Santos had given to the county committee. Mr. Santos\u2019s claims about his Jewish ancestry and his family\u2019s experience with the Holocaust, which multiple media organizations have since called into question, drew particular anguish. Once describing himself as a \u201cproud American Jew,\u201d Mr. Santos has since walked back that assertion, saying instead that he was \u201cJew-ish.\u201d The Nassau County executive, Bruce Blakeman, said that Mr. Santos\u2019s claims were beyond the pale, particularly given the large population of Holocaust survivors and their descendants in Nassau County. \u201cIt is simply tragic and outrageous and disgusting,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba at his birthday party in Entebbe, Uganda, in May.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nGen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba has been positioning himself as Uganda\u2019s next leader. But his provocative tweets have unnerved Ugandans and put his father in a bind.\n\nKAMPALA, Uganda \u2014 He has boasted that he could capture the capital of neighboring Kenya in two weeks. He has offered a dowry of 100 cows to marry Italy\u2019s new female prime minister. And he has claimed that the majority of \u201cnon-white\u201d people around the world supported Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. With a barrage of provocative, late-night Twitter posts in the last year, Muhoozi Kainerugaba \u2014 the 48-year-old son of the president of Uganda, and a military general \u2014 has unnerved Ugandans and regional allies, and become an embarrassment for President Yoweri Museveni, who has chided his eldest child publicly, apologized on his behalf and promised that his son would leave Twitter altogether. But General Kainerugaba is still tweeting, raising his public profile as he tries to position himself to succeed his father, a close Western military ally whose landlocked nation receives almost a billion dollars in development assistance each year from the United States. General Kainerugaba has vowed not to \u201cstop until we are in complete control\u201d of Uganda. His father has held an increasingly authoritarian grip on the country for 37 years, a six-term president who at 78 has already begun receiving endorsements to run in the 2026 elections. Ugandan political experts say he is unlikely ever to relinquish power.\n\nBut as President Museveni\u2019s vigor wanes, experts say he is looking to preserve his family\u2019s dominance and trying to line up his son as a successor. Yet he is coy about fully backing him, in part because of his exasperation with the stream of erratic tweets his son has shared with his over 650,000 followers, according to several Uganda analysts and Western officials. \u201cEven as he encourages him to become a public figure, Museveni now realizes that he is not in full control of his son,\u201d said a senior Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \u201cHe is not in the same caliber politically as his father and he is quite self-absorbed and that informs people\u2019s assessment of whether he is suitable for the presidency.\u201d The question of succession has taken center stage in Uganda, one of many African countries ruled by aging strongmen. Some African leaders have set up their children, wives or other relatives as successors. Other leaders have tried to lay the groundwork for successors, but failed \u2014 as in Zimbabwe, Egypt and Angola, where the ruling dos Santos family lost control when its patriarch stepped down.\n\n\u201cDue to Museveni\u2019s advancing age, there\u2019s a lot of pressure building on the question of succession and Muhoozi is an insurance policy,\u201d said Michael Mutyaba, a Ugandan researcher and political analyst. \u201cHe is meant to act as a shock absorber.\u201d General Kainerugaba declined multiple requests for an interview through a spokesman, and President Museveni\u2019s spokesman did not respond. Since coming to power in 1986, Mr. Museveni has changed laws to stay in office, suspended dozens of nongovernmental organizations, and subjected activists and opposition members to arbitrary detention, disappearances and torture. Two years ago, the president declared victory after a bloody election replete with accusations of vote tampering.\n\nThe flood of tweets from General Kainerugaba has revived questions about an alleged scheme, known as the \u201cMuhoozi Project,\u201d to groom the president\u2019s son for power. The government has denied that there ever was any such plan. But with the recent tweets, there is renewed apprehension about dynastic rule. Mr. Museveni\u2019s family is deeply entrenched in power. His wife, Janet, is the minister of education and sports. His brother Salim Saleh is an influential businessman and serves as a military adviser. His son-in-law, Odrek Rwabwogo, is a presidential adviser who harbors political ambitions.\n\nGeneral Kainerugaba has held several strategic positions in the military and is a special adviser to his father. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What\u2019s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. Last March, the general tweeted his intention to retire from the army, a precondition to running for office in Uganda. The decision caught military officials by surprise. He later retracted it, saying he would retire in eight years. His offhand tweets about the war in Ukraine have especially discomfited his father, according to two people familiar with those discussions. Mr. Museveni has said he wished to remain neutral about the war in Ukraine. When General Kainerugaba voiced support for President Vladimir V. Putin, the president stated that his son was \u201cspeaking for himself.\u201d In October, when General Kainerugaba threatened to capture the Kenyan capital, the president asked Kenyans for forgiveness. He then fired General Kainerugaba as commander of the country\u2019s land forces \u2014 although he promoted him from lieutenant general to a full general \u2014 and said he directed him to stay off Twitter and cease commenting on other nations\u2019 internal affairs.\n\nDavid Kabanda, a lawmaker with the ruling National Resistance Movement party and a staunch supporter of General Kainerugaba, said in an interview, \u201cIt is high time for President Museveni to hand over power to the next generation.\u201d Over the years, Mr. Museveni has amended the Constitution, to remove presidential term and age limits, allowing him to retain power. He could similarly lay the groundwork for his son\u2019s eventual accession to power, Mr. Mutyaba, the analyst, said. Last year, some members of the ruling party suggested that the president should be elected by lawmakers and district officials instead of the general population, which would make it easier for his son to attain the high office. \u201cThey will keep changing the rules and amending to get what they want,\u201d Mr. Mutyaba said.\n\nGeneral Kainerugaba was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, while his father fought the government of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. His name, Muhoozi, means \u201cthe avenger,\u201d the president has said. He has three younger sisters: Natasha, Patience and Diana. He was shy at school, according to three friends, but showed interest in the debate club. He spent hours reading about military strategy and revolutionary leaders like Mao Zedong, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, they said. His friends described him as a good listener and generous to a fault. But by his early 20s, General Kainerugaba was predisposed to bombastic declarations, telling a conference in 1995 that Uganda would \u201cnever have lasting peace\u201d unless wealthy Ugandans ruled the nation.\n\nHe has said he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, in Britain, but the school declined to comment for privacy reasons. He finished a 10-month course in 2008 at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He published a book on the history of modern Ugandan resistance battles. His pugilistic approach to politics was evident after 2012, when he became the head of the restructured Special Forces Command, an elite private unit tasked with protecting Mr. Museveni and his interests. The outfit has been accused of carrying out human rights violations, particularly around the 2021 elections. General Kainerugaba has also personally faced accusations. He was named in a complaint alleging a wave of abductions and abuse, filed in the International Criminal Court by Bobi Wine, a musician turned politician who ran for president against Mr. Museveni in 2021.",

Do you follow the lives of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex?\n\nDid you pay attention to their wedding in 2018? Their announcement in 2020 that they would be stepping back from their royal duties? Have you watched \u201cHarry & Meghan,\u201d the recent Netflix series that took viewers behind the scenes of their lives?\n\n\u201cSpare,\u201d the hotly anticipated memoir by Prince Harry, has captivated people across the world. It was released on Tuesday and is shaping up to be one of the year\u2019s biggest books.\n\nWill you read the book? Do you care about Harry and Meghan\u2019s story? Or have you had enough?\n\nIn \u201c11 Takeaways From Prince Harry\u2019s Memoir, \u2018Spare,\u2019\u201d the staff of The New York Times\u2019s Books department highlights from the book. Here are a few excerpts:\n\nThe morning after Diana, Harry\u2019s mother, died in a car crash in Paris, Charles, his father, woke him up to tell him what had happened. \u201cHe sat down on the edge of the bed,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cHe put a hand on my knee. Darling boy, Mummy\u2019s been in a car crash.\u201d He went on, \u201cThey tried, darling boy. I\u2019m afraid she didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Harry writes that \u201cnone of what I said to him then remains in my memory. It\u2019s possible that I didn\u2019t say anything. What I do remember with startling clarity is that I didn\u2019t cry. Not one tear. Pa didn\u2019t hug me. He wasn\u2019t great at showing emotions under normal circumstances, how could he be expected to show them in such a crisis? But his hand did fall once more on my knee and he said: It\u2019s going to be OK. That was quite a lot for him. Fatherly, hopeful, kind. And so very untrue.\u201d Press leaks from his family were common, he says According to the book, Charles and sometimes Camilla approved damaging press leaks about Harry and William. On one occasion, Harry writes, Charles \u2014 advised by a spin doctor \u2014 cooperated with the tabloids on a story about Harry and drugs to bolster his own faltering reputation. \u201cNo more the unfaithful husband, Pa would now be presented to the world as the harried single dad coping with a drug-addled child.\u201d Much later, in 2019, Harry writes, William was \u201cseething\u201d because \u201cPa and Camilla\u2019s people had planted a story or stories about him, and Kate, and the kids, and he wasn\u2019t going to take it any more. Give Pa and Camilla an inch, he said, they take a mile.\u201d Fear of public speaking morphed into a fear of crowds, and then full-blown anxiety attacks on the cusp of his 30th birthday. In the book, Harry sees the afflictions as a form of PTSD, attributing them to both his military service and the death of his mother. When he told his father what was happening, Charles said: \u201cI suppose it\u2019s my fault. I should\u2019ve got you the help you needed years ago.\u201d Harry writes: \u201cI assured him that it wasn\u2019t his fault. But I appreciated the apology.\u201d\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\u2022 None What is your reaction to the new book by Prince Harry? Are you fascinated by the lives of Harry and Meghan and by the royal family in general? Why or why not?\n\u2022 None If you are not particularly interested in Harry and Meghan, what do you think accounts for the worldwide attraction, if not obsession, with them?\n\u2022 None Which, if any, of the takeaways from the article grab your interest and why?

What might be the positive effects of their speaking out on their private lives?\n\u2022 None In the guest essay \u201cPrince Harry and the Value of Silence,\u201d Patti Davis, the daughter of President Ronald Reagan, writes that while Prince Harry\u2019s experiences with his family matter, \u201cnot every truth has to be told to the entire world.\u201d And Sarah Lyall, a reporter for The Times, wonders if Harry and Meghan\u2019s prolonged campaign to tell their story \u2014 and to present themselves as victims of the British royal family, the tabloid press, and critics and haters everywhere \u2014 is turning public sympathies against them. Do you agree with either of these takes? Is sharing your private life \u2014 your feelings, your truth, your grievances \u2014 publicly a good thing?

            "section": "New York",
            "content": "The founders of the new law firm said emergent anti-democratic acts around the country led them to form their new firm.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMark F. Pomerantz, Carey R. Dunne and Michele Roberts, the former head of the N.B.A. players union, will launch a pro bono law firm, the Free and Fair Litigation Group.\n\nLast year, Mark F. Pomerantz and Carey R. Dunne were leading the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation into Donald J. Trump\u2019s business practices. Now, they have turned their attention to a broader phenomenon that they say the former president represents: threats to democracy in the United States. Mr. Pomerantz and Mr. Dunne, who resigned last year when the district attorney decided not to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump, said they have formed a pro bono law firm that aims to stem the tide of anti-democratic policies proliferating around the country. The firm \u2014 the Free and Fair Litigation Group, which opens its doors this week \u2014 is also led by Michele A. Roberts, the former head of the union that represents professional basketball players. All three founders have extensive experience as litigators, and they plan to defend policies they see as just and bring lawsuits challenging those they believe are undemocratic, the three founding partners said in an interview. Their work will initially focus on voting rights, gun control and free speech.\n\n\u201cAs I see it, we\u2019re now faced with not just one politician, but really with a national movement that\u2019s aimed at rolling back decades of rights and constitutional principles,\u201d Mr. Dunne said. In the two years since Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen helped spark a violent riot at the Capitol, election denial has only grown within the Republican Party. Mr. Trump is once again a leading contender for president, and the House is in the hands of Republicans \u2014 many of whom voted against certifying President Biden\u2019s election victory. Against that backdrop of deep political polarization, it remains to be seen how much of the new firm\u2019s ambitious agenda can be accomplished, particularly if its cases reach a Supreme Court that has taken a sharp rightward turn.\n\nThe new firm differs from larger groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Brennan Center for Justice, which conduct lobbying and research in addition to their work in court, because of its singular focus on litigation. The venture was a product of serendipitous timing: three busy lawyers who found themselves with nothing on their dockets in the spring of last year. Ms. Roberts, an experienced litigator, had just retired as executive director of the N.B.A. Players Association. Mr. Pomerantz, a well-known defense lawyer who also served as the criminal division chief at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, came out of retirement in early 2021 to lead the district attorney\u2019s investigation into Mr. Trump. He resigned in February of last year, as did Mr. Dunne, another prominent litigator who oversaw the Trump investigation and successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court twice in the fight over a subpoena for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns. Although Mr. Pomerantz and Mr. Dunne had begun to present evidence to a grand jury about the former president\u2019s business practices by early last year, the new district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, developed concerns about proving the case and decided not to seek to indict Mr. Trump at that time, prompting the resignations. The investigation, which began under the prior district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is now continuing under Mr. Bragg, who also recently secured the conviction of Mr. Trump\u2019s company.\n\nWhile the new law firm currently has no plans to take on Mr. Trump directly, its mission was in some sense inspired by his influence over the Republican Party and the Supreme Court, to which he appointed three conservative justices. \u201cTrump is obviously the poster boy for increased authoritarianism,\u201d said Mr. Pomerantz, who has written a book about his time investigating Mr. Trump that Simon & Schuster announced on Wednesday would be published in February. \u201cHe personifies the problem, but he\u2019s far from the only manifestation of the problem.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump has slammed Mr. Pomerantz publicly, calling him a \u201clow-life attorney\u201d who \u201cis a \u2018Never Trumper\u2019 and a Hillary Clinton sycophant.\u201d The firm\u2019s first case involves gun control policies under attack in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling last year expanding the right to carry firearms outside the home. The firm is defending four Colorado towns, each with bans on carrying assault weapons in public, that were sued by a gun rights group after the court\u2019s decision. The case is scheduled to go to trial this fall. Measures like Florida\u2019s \u201cStop W.O.K.E.\u201d law, which limits talk of race, gender and nationality in schools and the workplace, are also of interest at the new firm. It has begun examining the possibility of bringing a First Amendment lawsuit focused on similar laws in other states that prohibit diversity training in the workplace. The firm is also developing plans to challenge Florida\u2019s arrest of a number of people with criminal histories who were able to register to vote in the 2020 election even though their past convictions should have barred them from doing so. Although criminal charges against some of those people have been dismissed, the firm is researching the possibility of suing the state for having violated the Voting Rights Act, arguing that the arrests discourage legal voting by people with criminal convictions. \u201cIt\u2019s just disgraceful,\u201d Ms. Roberts said, adding that the case had hit home for her as someone who is concerned with voting rights and with \u201clegislative changes to election laws in various states.\u201d To litigate the cases, the firm will turn for support to a roster of prominent law firms and advocacy groups.\n\nIn the Colorado gun control case, the firm is working with Everytown for Gun Safety, the group founded by the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as well as Davis Polk, Mr. Dunne\u2019s former firm. On the Florida voting rights case, they have met with a group called Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group aiming to curb authoritarian politics, as well as Paul Weiss, where Mr. Pomerantz was a partner for many years. Mark Pomerantz and Mr. Dunne led the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s inquiry into Mr. Trump until they resigned last year. The outside firms are providing their resources on a pro bono basis. The new firm\u2019s board of directors will also include a number of boldfaced names from the criminal justice world, including Tali Farhadian Weinstein, a former general counsel at the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office who was a Democratic candidate for Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Free and Fair\u2019s executive director will be Danny Frost, a lawyer who served as a senior adviser and spokesman in the district attorney\u2019s office under Mr. Vance, when Mr. Dunne and Mr. Pomerantz were working on the Trump investigation. Thus far, the firm has mostly accepted donations from friends and professional acquaintances but in the coming months will ramp up their fund-raising now that the I.R.S. has certified the firm as a nonprofit. Originally, the principals had expected that getting authorized for tax-exempt status would take half a year. Then they learned that they could make an emergency application to the I.R.S., \u201cbut only if what you\u2019re providing is so desperately needed by the country that you can claim emergency treatment status,\u201d Mr. Dunne said. They filed their application in October. Within 14 days, they had received the emergency approval.",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTheir early inaction in Sunday\u2019s riot shows how security forces can help empower violence and deepen the threat to democracy.\n\nThe mob attack on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on Sunday was a sudden and major test of the country\u2019s resilience. And at least at the start, a conspicuous absence of police security was a factor as supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro surged to the Congress, Supreme Court and Presidential Palace. The reasons for that delay are not completely clear, but some senior officials are now accusing the capital security forces of delaying more out of intent than confusion. Brazil\u2019s justice minister, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, said that there were far fewer officers present than had been agreed upon in the security plan made days earlier. And one Supreme Court justice has issued an arrest warrant for the top capital security officer. Videos circulated online of the officers who were present appearing to escort protesters on their way to the federal buildings, and pausing to snap selfies with them. By the end of the day, things had changed. New contingents of officers arrived, and they regained control over the capital buildings. Over 1,200 people were detained, more than 700 of whom were accused of having participated in the violence. The authorities have now moved on to arresting those suspected of organizing or financing the riots. Two government security officials are also accused of aiding the riots through criminal negligence or complicity.\n\nBut by the time the arrests began, the damage had been done. Buildings from all three branches of the federal government had been ransacked, and valuable works of art vandalized.The police are usually the first line of response to such mass action, and that gives them tremendous power to affect outcomes. Those early hours were an object lesson in the way that police inaction can empower political violence and exacerbate the threats it poses to democracy. And that may be particularly true in Brazil, where one of the vital questions facing the newly elected government is how much to try to reform or constrain the security sector. Judged by the rioters\u2019 own stated goals, the violent attack in Bras\u00edlia was a failure. The events on Sunday did not lead to a military coup, which many of those present had been calling for over the past 10 weeks. Naunihal Singh, the author of \u201cSeizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,\u201d posits that the costs of military coups have become so high, in terms of capital flight, regional sanctions and other forms of international pressure, that it would now be highly unlikely for one to happen in a country like Brazil. Thousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Mass Attack: After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. Here is what went wrong\n\u2022 None The Investigations: Authorities face Authorities face several major questions as they piece together how rioters briefly seized the seats of Brazil\u2019s government.\n\u2022 None Digital Playbook: Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Many are drawing a comparison to the Jan. 6 attack\n\u2022 None The Role of the Police: Their early inaction in the riot shows Their early inaction in the riot shows how security forces can help empower violence and deepen the threat to democracy. Indeed, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva remains secure in the presidency, and Mr. Bolsonaro remains in Florida. And the attack has drawn widespread opposition from the public and condemnation from lawmakers. On Monday, the heads of all three branches of the government issued a rare joint statement condemning the violence. It is possible that the backlash to Sunday\u2019s events will discredit Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters and drain energy from their movement. Yanilda Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a Harvard University political scientist who studies policing and democracy in the Americas, noted that opposition to the violence in Bras\u00edlia within the government, public opinion and news media commentary has been far more unified than the reaction to the Jan. 6 attacks in the United States two years ago. If that opinion holds, and the protest movement fractures under the disapproval, then the risk of further violence would be fairly low.\n\nBut that could change, particularly as the government begins prosecuting the hundreds of people arrested for participating in the riot. The new administration \u201chas to prosecute these people, and is going to prosecute these people,\u201d said Amy Erica Smith, a political scientist at the University of Iowa who studies Brazilian politics and democracy. \u201cBut prosecuting them may also be destabilizing.\u201d It\u2019s important, too, to know that a sudden military coup is not the only way that political violence can undermine democracy. The police in Brazil have a history of using strategic inaction as a political tool, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. Her research found that in S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1980s, for instance, the police let riots unfold during a time of economic crisis in order to generate a sense of panic in society that would put pressure on politicians. And in 2013, after the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo delayed overtime payments to the local military police, they were deliberately lax in policing a major cultural festival, leading to a spike in crime and a slew of bad headlines for the mayor. Now, she sees a risk that pro-Bolsonaro factions within the police or other security services could \u201cstand with their arms crossed\u201d rather than stopping political violence in the future. There are allegations that deliberate inaction already played a role in Sunday\u2019s riot. On Tuesday, Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice (and a polarizing figure in his own right, who has been accused of severely overstepping his authority), said that investigators had found evidence that security officials knew violence was brewing but did not stop it. He issued an arrest warrant for Anderson Torres, the man effectively in charge of security for the capital, in response to a request by the federal police. \u201cThe risk is of a slow erosion of institutions and norms,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. In the worst-case scenario, bottom-up political violence, combined with targeted inaction from elements within the police or other security services, could add up to \u201ca slow-building coup, almost an everyday coup.\u201d One reason for that kind of strategic inaction might be support for Mr. Bolsonaro, who is widely believed to be the preferred candidate of the police and military rank and file. But another, perhaps more likely, motivation is that many within the security establishment fear that Mr. Lula's policies could threaten the security forces\u2019 status, privileges or immunities.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro embraced the military and the police as a matter of political identity as well as policy. As a legislator, he dedicated his vote to impeach Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Lula\u2019s handpicked successor, to the man who had tortured her when she was imprisoned under the military dictatorship. As president, he expanded immunity for police officers who used deadly force, increased military pensions and appointed military officials to powerful cabinet positions. \u201cSecurity forces have gotten away with a lot of things in recent years. Police violence has gone mostly unchecked,\u201d said Christoph Harig, a research fellow at Technical University Braunschweig in Germany who studies policing and civilian-military relations in Brazil. \u201cThere are so many cases of innocents being killed, mostly by police, or sometimes the army on internal missions, where those killers have gotten away with very lenient sentences. It\u2019s this impunity that\u2019s prevalent in a lot of the Brazilian police and military.\u201d Mr. Lula does not share that political affinity for the security forces, and has signaled that he wants to limit the role of the military in politics. Many wonder how far he will go in reversing Bolsonaro-era policies, or whether he might try to go further, as he did in 2009, when he proposed a truth commission into dictatorship-era torture and other crimes and a review of the law that provided amnesty for them. (He was forced to drop the proposal after multiple senior military officials threatened to resign in protest.) Mr. Harig noted that military officials in Bras\u00edlia defended the pro-coup demonstrators as \u201cpeaceful protesters\u201d and allowed them to camp outside military headquarters as their numbers grew over the past 10 weeks. That effectively sheltered the pro-coup movement, though the military leadership itself refused to actually support or conduct a coup. That may pose an object lesson to the government, Mr. Harig believes, on the importance of remaining on good terms with the military. He cited Mr. Lula\u2019s appointment of Jos\u00e9 Mucio as the defense secretary, a civilian but one widely seen as friendly to military interests, as a sign that such pressure had been effective. \u201cI think these protest camps have been sort of useful idiots for the military in recent weeks,\u201d Mr. Harig said. \u201cThey won\u2019t accept any threats to their institutional privileges.\u201d Ms. Smith, the Iowa professor, said that she thinks Mr. Lula will be able to shore up enough support within the military and police to crack down on violent protests as needed. But if he doesn\u2019t, and the protests expand into attacks on crucial infrastructure like oil refineries, becoming a kind of low-level insurgency, she believes that could be politically destabilizing \u2014 and perhaps fatal to his presidency.",

The figure marked the largest first-day sales for any nonfiction book ever published by Penguin Random House, the world\u2019s largest publisher. The memoir\u2019s strong debut, while extraordinary, wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. An explosive tell-all by a self-exiled prince seemed from the start to be as close to a sure bet as one can get in the fickle publishing business. Sales have been building for months, especially in the days before publication, when the book\u2019s contents started to become public in unintentional leaks and in high-profile interviews. \u201cWe sold books in every location \u2014 and we sold a lot of them,\u201d said Shannon DeVito, the director of books at Barnes & Noble. \u201cSome people came in right before work, some people came in on their lunch break, some people came in after,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the velocity of sales throughout the day was gigantic.\u201d\n\nThe magnitude of its sales puts \u201cSpare\u201d among some of the best-selling hardcover books in recent memory. Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cA Promised Land\u201d sold more than 887,000 copies across formats in the United States and Canada on its first day of publication, according to its publisher, Penguin Random House. Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cBecoming,\u201d also published by Penguin Random House, sold more than 725,000 units in the U.S. and Canada on its first day, the company said. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

NPD BookScan tracks print sales independently, and will report the first week of sales for \u201cSpare\u201d on January 19. In Britain, \u201cSpare\u201d set a record for first-day sales of a nonfiction book, selling 400,000 copies, including pre-orders, according to the publisher, Transworld Penguin Random House. Transworld has already ordered an additional 200,000 copies of the book, according to Larry Finlay, its managing director. \u201cThe only books that have sold faster in a day have been about the other Harry, Harry Potter,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThe public appetite is enormous.\u201d The critical reception of \u201cSpare\u201d has been mixed, with some reviewers praising the prose but questioning whether Harry went too far into airing petty grievances. \u201cThe prince claims to have a spotty memory \u2014 \u2018a defense mechanism, most likely\u2019 \u2014 but doesn\u2019t appear to have forgotten a single line ever printed about him and his wife, and the last section of his tell-all degenerates into a tiresome back-and-forth about who\u2019s leaking what and why,\u201d the New York Times critic Alexandra Jacobs wrote in her review.\n\nSome critics in Britain wrote about the book in baffled tones, lobbing superlatives that were not always complimentary. A review in The Guardian called it \u201ca flawed attempt to reclaim the narrative\u201d that is \u201cby turns sympathetic and absurd.\u201d A critic writing for the BBC called it \u201cthe weirdest book ever written by a royal\u201d and said that it sometimes reads like \u201cthe longest angry drunk text ever sent.\u201d In The Independent, a reviewer said the memoir was \u201crichly detailed and at times beautifully written,\u201d adding that \u201cif Harry is going to set fire to his family, he has at least done it with some style.\u201d What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What\u2019s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. By the time the book was released, many of its most incendiary claims had already been picked apart in the press. The week before publication, The Guardian ran an article that detailed a physical confrontation between Prince William and Prince Harry; as Harry describes it in the book, William knocked him to the floor. That same week, copies of \u201cSpare\u201d accidentally went on sale early in Spain and were snatched up by news outlets. Dozens of stories followed from around the world: Prince Harry said in the book that he killed 25 people in Afghanistan. Prince Harry wrote that his brother encouraged him to dress as a Nazi for a costume party. Prince Harry lost his virginity to an older woman in a field behind a bar. The steady drip of revelations led some observers to question whether the book itself would hold any new information. Rather than dissuading buyers, the news media frenzy that followed each new release appeared to help the book sell. \u201cWe were like, is this going to damage sales, do people think they\u2019ve read the story?\u201d Finlay, Transworld\u2019s managing director, said. \u201cThe headline grabbing parts are interesting, but it\u2019s not the most interesting thing about the book. I think all it\u2019s done is stoke the public interest.\u201d ReaderLink, a major book distributor, said pre-orders jumped after the article in The Guardian detailing the scuffle between the brothers. Waterstones, a bookstore chain in Britain, saw a surge of in-store reservations after the article, according to James Daunt, who heads the company. The question becomes whether \u201cSpare\u201d continues to sell briskly, or if interest will fade as the news media storm calms. Before the book\u2019s publication, some in the industry thought interest would peter out after strong initial sales. But DeVito said Barnes & Noble expects the book to be one of the biggest releases of 2023. She added that the \u201cexpertise and talent\u201d of the book\u2019s ghostwriter, J.R. Moehringer, would help make the book\u2019s appeal lasting. (In the acknowledgments, Harry calls Moehringer his \u201ccollaborator and friend, confessor and sometime sparring partner.\u201d) ReaderLink, which supplies books to major retailers like Target and Walmart, said it had ordered about 300,000 copies of \u201cSpare.\u201d But rather than shipping all the books out to ReaderLink at once, Penguin Random House held some of them back so they could rush the books directly to stores in case so much of the book leaked that the publishing date had to be moved up.\n\nThat threshold was never crossed, however, and the books went on sale as planned, on Tuesday. Even that was a victory of sorts for the publisher, which had to contend with shifting publication dates as the memoir was delayed \u2014 Harry got cold feet about the process at times, said book industry executives with knowledge of the process. In the acknowledgments, Harry thanked top Penguin Random House executives for their patience and \u201cunderstanding as timelines changed, not once, but twice.\u201d Harry\u2019s thorough account of his family\u2019s endless drama has also raised questions about what, if any, material of interest remains for any future projects he and his wife, Meghan, might pursue. \u201cSpare\u201d was sold for a rumored sum of $20 million as part of a multi-book deal, with flexibility as to the number and type of books Harry and Meghan could produce, according to people with knowledge of the acquisition process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such negotiations are private. In a series of interviews to promote the memoir, Harry was occasionally asked about the leaks that preceded its publication, and why, if he so despised the media scrutiny that had caused such chaos in his life, he was offering the public more information about his family. His answer was that by publishing a memoir, he was trying to put many of the rumors to rest by speaking up. \u201cThe last few days have been hurtful and challenging,\u201d he said during an interview with Stephen Colbert. \u201cHopefully now that the book is out, people will be able to see the context.\u201d",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "I eke an apology out of my younger daughter several times a week. She is generally a serene child, but when she loses her temper she can go from bleating lamb to aggressive honey badger in seconds. She only acts like this at home, and often her upset is focused on her older sister for some perceived injustice \u2014 \u201cShe only wants to watch \u2018Friends\u2019 and it\u2019s boring!\u201d Because she\u2019s the younger sister and only 6, and doesn\u2019t yet have the verbal dexterity to spar with words, she occasionally resorts to charging and tackling. I\u2019m pretty sure she doesn\u2019t feel particularly remorseful about sacking her older sister. But when this occurs, I insist that she apologize and agree that we don\u2019t put our hands on anybody \u2014 even when we\u2019d rather watch \u201cFull House.\u201d Deep down, I think we both know this is a farce and that she might wake up and tackle her sister again tomorrow, but I still find worth in going through the motions of apology, though I\u2019m not always sure why. I was thinking of this when I read \u201cSorry, Sorry, Sorry: The Case for Good Apologies,\u201d a helpful new book by Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy. They argue that apologizing well is a difficult art, and that we\u2019d be a more just and kind society if more people \u2014 including our young children, celebrities and politicians \u2014 learned how to do it. The authors list the qualities of good and bad apologies. The No. 1 reason they give for not apologizing at all is: \u201cYou don\u2019t mean it.\u201d As they explain, \u201cYou\u2019ll just apologize badly and risk making things worse.\u201d They have six and a half concise and straightforward rules for a good apology, and these apply to villains of all ages: \u201c1. Say you\u2019re sorry. 2. For what you did. 3. Show you understand why it was bad. 4. Only explain if you need to; don\u2019t make excuses. 5. Say why it won\u2019t happen again. 6. Offer to make up for it.\u201d The additional half-step is to listen.\n\nI agree with Ingall and McCarthy that grudging apologies, especially those from public figures, can often backfire \u2014 we\u2019ve all rolled our eyes at the \u201cif I offended anyone\u201d frame \u2014 though I think that in some circumstances, a sorry that might not be full-throated still has its place. In the kid context, it\u2019s pretty straightforward: I don\u2019t want to let my kid think it\u2019s OK to body-slam someone without making amends, and I don\u2019t want her to think she can skate through life without even attempting to remedy or reflect on her mistakes. In the context of public figures \u2014 the P.R. mea culpa, as it were \u2014 there are endless examples of famous and semifamous people making not-so-great apologies. Many of them trip up on step 4: They include a lot of excuses and explanations for their behavior that wind up coming off as defensive and not really contrite. A recent example that springs to mind is the kerfuffle involving comments Whoopi Goldberg made about the Holocaust, several months after she was briefly suspended from her job at \u201cThe View\u201d for making similarly inaccurate remarks about the Holocaust \u2014 a depressingly frequent topic of unconvincing celebrity apologies of late. If you missed it: In January 2022, Goldberg claimed, incorrectly, that the Holocaust was \u201cnot about race,\u201d quipping, \u201cThis is white people doing it to white people, so y\u2019all going to fight amongst yourselves.\u201d After she dug herself in deeper during an interview with Stephen Colbert, she apologized in a way that seemed earnest, or at least checked the boxes of a robust apology, saying, \u201cit is indeed about race because Hitler and the Nazis considered Jews to be an inferior race.\u201d She added: \u201cWords matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments, as I said, and I stand corrected. I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know and y\u2019all know, because I\u2019ve always done that.\u201d But more recently she has appeared to walk back that very solid apology, to the extent that I now wonder about its sincerity: In December, in an interview with The Times of London, she suggested that the Holocaust wasn\u2019t originally about race and went on to say: \u201cYou could not tell a Jew on a street. You could find me. You couldn\u2019t find them. That was the point I was making. But you would have thought that I\u2019d taken a big old stinky dump on the table, butt naked.\u201d Following that interview, she apologized again, saying \u201cI was asked about my comments from earlier this year\u201d and that she \u201ctried to convey to the reporter what I had said and why, and attempted to recount that time. It was never my intention to appear as if I was doubling down on hurtful comments.\u201d To be clear: As a Jewish person descended from Holocaust survivors, I still admire Goldberg and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s antisemitic, though I realize others may disagree. I gained a lot of insight into her outlook, and her desire to speak her mind at the potential cost of transgression, in this excellent profile by Jazmine Hughes in The New York Times Magazine.\n\nI support Goldberg\u2019s right to speak her mind, including when I disagree with her and when she\u2019s pretty clearly wrong. Still, I wish she would cut short her comment-apology cycle on this topic, because the exercise makes me question what the point even is. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done much to further the public\u2019s understanding of the Jewish community\u2019s history, or really helped take the temperature down in our overall discourse \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t that be the goal here? While I don\u2019t think she meant any harm, I also felt like her succession of statements added up to more chum for the perpetual outrage cycle. As my colleague Jessica Bennett put it last year: \u201cInstead of leaving us feeling healed, or as if there is a rightful place for accountability in our world, all this apologizing seems to, instead, have had a flattening effect.\u201d And while there are obviously big differences between a celebrity\u2019s complicated relationship with public statements and quotidian disputes among siblings, I think the act of apologizing has some universally applicable qualities. When you apologize, you\u2019re offering vulnerability, opening the door for someone to judge and forgive you \u2014 something Goldberg admirably did, but then kind of stepped on with her muddled follow-on thoughts. Ingall and McCarthy write that a strong apology is valorous, that \u201cthe aftermath of a good apology can improve the lives and spirits of everyone it touches.\u201d I called them and asked about seemingly forced apologies \u2014 both my daughter\u2019s and those of various luminaries \u2014 and my mixed feelings about them. Specifically, I asked whether, despite their caution against apologies one doesn\u2019t really mean, there might be some value in a not entirely sincere \u201csorry.\u201d They told me that an imperfect apology from a public figure can be a teaching tool for us and our kids. \u201cOne thing you can do is talk with your kids about the crappy apologies that you see. Right? \u2018Let\u2019s discuss why this is crappy. Let\u2019s discuss what this person could have done better,\u2019\u201d Ingall said. McCarthy said that we can get our children involved in figuring out how to make a better apology: You can ask your kids what they might say instead that would better repair the situation. They also affirmed that there\u2019s value in pushing your kids to apologize even if they don\u2019t feel it in their hearts. Both Ingall and McCarthy said you can encourage your kid to apologize for breaking the house rules against name calling and fighting even if she doesn\u2019t feel truly bad about being so incensed that she felt the urge to charge her sister like an ornery rhino. She might still feel aggrieved, her sister might still be on guard, but at least the whole house can move on (for now). Ingall and McCarthy also made the point that an important part of learning the art \u2014 the skill \u2014 of apologizing is accepting that your apology might not fix the situation for everyone. \u201cBeing uncomfortable because you\u2019re in the wrong and not being instantly rescued are all really good life lessons for kids,\u201d Ingall said. Those are lessons most of us adults still struggle with from time to time, pushing back against full accountability with defensiveness, whether we\u2019re famous or not. I hope for my daughter that even though she has to be nudged to apologize, the importance of the practice will eventually sink in. Unlike a celebrity\u2019s relationship with the public, my kid\u2019s relationship with her sister is one that will surely endure many cycles of harm and repair.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWarm gestures by the American president have helped cement a critical relationship with a Mexican leader whose cooperation on migration, climate change and the drug trade is crucial.\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 It was only about two years ago that Mexico\u2019s leader would not even recognize President Biden\u2019s election victory. But on Monday, the two men were standing side by side at Mexico\u2019s national palace, locked in a group hug with their wives. The Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, later called his American counterpart \u201ca visionary president,\u201d saying \u201cthere would be no other leader\u201d who could unify the Western Hemisphere. It was a remarkable turn in a critical relationship that started on uneasy footing, but has shifted in part because Mr. Biden has invested heavily in personal diplomacy with the Mexican head of state \u2014 and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has realized how beneficial it is to be on friendly terms with the United States. Significant challenges remain pressing on both sides of the border, and the two countries are not always aligned on how to contain an extraordinary movement of people across the Americas, curb the surging trade in fentanyl or combat climate change.\n\nThe meeting between Mr. Biden, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, known as the North American Leaders Summit, concluded on Tuesday without yielding much in the way of new policies. And it\u2019s unclear whether any of the warm gestures on display at the summit will translate into more lasting cooperation on those contentious issues. At a news conference on Tuesday evening, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador stressed the importance of leaving behind \u201chegemonic interventionism,\u201d saying the three countries must treat each other \u201cas good neighbors, economic allies and as friends.\u201d Energy remains a sticking point, as the United States and Canada have accused Mexico of violating a free-trade agreement with policies that boost a state-owned electrical utility over international companies. But the gathering did send a clear message: Years after former President Donald J. Trump at best neglected \u2014 and at worst battered \u2014 partnerships in North America, the United States is back on better terms with some of its closest allies. \u201cThis trip is a good opportunity for President Biden to deepen his personal engagement with President L\u00f3pez Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s an important dimension to this.\u201d\n\nSenior Biden administration officials have recognized that the rapport between the two leaders was key to securing deeper collaboration from Mexico\u2019s government in stemming the historic flows of people arriving at the U.S. border. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have both of you as partners \u2014 and, might I add, friends \u2014 as we work together to realize a shared vision for North America,\u201d Mr. Biden said to his Canadian and Mexican counterparts at Tuesday\u2019s news conference. Mr. Biden has been focused on building personal ties with the Mexican leader, said a senior state department official not authorized to speak publicly. The official noted that the U.S. president chose Mexico as his first trip to any country in the Western Hemisphere and that the two leaders speak regularly on the phone. The friendly exchanges represent a notable shift from the way the relationship began. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador was among the last world leaders to congratulate Mr. Biden on his election victory in 2020, insisting on waiting \u201cuntil all the legal issues are resolved.\u201d The first time the two men got on the phone after the election, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador went out of his way to praise the \u201cvery good relationship\u201d his country had established with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between AMLO and Biden started off on the wrong foot,\u201d said Martha B\u00e1rcena, who was appointed by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 2018 to 2020. While Mr. Trump had called some Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and threatened America\u2019s closest economic partner with a trade war, he adhered to at least one principle that Mexico\u2019s leader valued: mostly staying out of the country\u2019s business. Mr. Trump did effectively browbeat Mexico into accepting a large number of migrants expelled from the United States, but in turn, he left Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to pursue an ambitious domestic agenda without saying much about the sometimes damaging effect on American interests. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador feared that largely hands-off approach would change with Mr. Biden, partly because the Mexican leader saw Democrats as more interested in imposing their values on Latin American countries, current and former officials from both countries said.\n\nBut in recent months, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s stance has appeared to soften. The Mexican leader, in his morning news conferences, has spoken about Mr. Biden in glowing terms, praising him as \u201cresponsible, sensible\u201d and \u201crespectful.\u201d What changed? Analysts point to Republicans\u2019 disappointing showing in the midterms and Mr. Biden\u2019s recovery in public opinion polls, a sign that the U.S. president might be politically stronger than many in Mexico expected. More urgent for Mexico\u2019s leader, though, are elections in his own country. This year will mark the beginning of campaigns for the 2024 presidential contest in Mexico, in which Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is barred from running again. But he is expected to have significant say in who from his Morena party will run to succeed him \u2014 and fight to cement his legacy with another six-year term. The Mexican president recognizes that the U.S. administration \u2014 which holds enormous economic and political sway in Mexico \u2014 could make it difficult to carry out the sweeping changes he promised to bring to the country after winning an overwhelming victory in 2018. For Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, it is now more valuable than ever to extinguish any whiff of antagonism between the two governments. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want the U.S. government to be supportive of the opposition \u2014 or an open critic of his policies,\u201d Ms. B\u00e1rcena said. \u201cIt\u2019s smarter to be on better terms with the U.S. government than how he was at the beginning.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Biden, landing an hour away from the capital was a small price to pay for placating a leader whose cooperation \u2014 on migration, energy and trade \u2014 is more important than ever. \u201cFor AMLO this is a get, being seen as respected by the U.S. president for his vision of policymaking, for his leadership,\u201d said Shannon O\u2019Neil, a Mexico expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe bet by the U.S. is, we\u2019ll give him the optics, and then he\u2019ll be more amenable to give us the substance.\u201d The ride from the airport, said Mr. Sullivan, gave the two leaders \u201cthe chance to just have a one-on-one chat,\u201d about \u201chow they\u2019re seeing the world right now, what\u2019s on their minds. I think they both got a lot out of it.\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador raved about how the American president \u201chimself showed me how the buttons worked,\u201d the Mexican leader said, referring to the vehicle\u2019s controls. \u201cPresident Biden is a friendly person.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe U.S. job market has staged a remarkable rebound since the start of the pandemic almost three years ago. The latest government data, released on Friday, showed that 2022 was the second-best year on record in terms of raw job growth, behind only 2021. Yet the number of people available to work remains substantially smaller as a share of the population than before the pandemic, and some key economic policymakers seem to have all but given up hope that it will grow much in the years ahead. The country has a \u201cstructural labor shortage\u201d that is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said last month. If Powell and his colleagues are right, their prediction has big implications for the U.S. economy. A smaller pool of workers makes it harder to rein in inflation because companies have to raise pay \u2014 and, most likely, prices \u2014 as they compete for workers. And beyond the inflation debate, an economy in which fewer people are working is one that cannot grow as quickly as in the past. Are they right? Many economists offered similar warnings of a labor shortage after the last recession ended in 2009. Instead, the work force staged an impressive rebound.\n\nIn today\u2019s newsletter, I want to talk about one reason the workers defied expectations a decade ago but are unlikely to now: baby boomers. The share of adults who were working or looking for jobs plummeted during the brutal recession and anemic recovery that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Many forecasters expected it to keep falling as the enormous baby boom generation moved toward retirement. Many boomers put off retiring, however. In 2019, just before the pandemic, 57 percent of Americans in their early 60s were still working, compared with 46 percent of that age group two decades earlier. Improved health and shifting industry patterns \u2014 more jobs in offices, fewer in factories \u2014 played a role. So did sheer financial necessity: The housing bust and stock market collapse left many people without enough savings for retirement. Instead of dropping, the share of workers and job seekers leveled off starting in about 2014, then began to rise slowly toward the end of the decade. That shift partly reflected the strengthening economic recovery, which drew workers off the sidelines as wages rose and opportunities improved. But the importance of the baby boomers is hard to overstate: Virtually all of the growth in the labor force between the end of the Great Recession and the start of the pandemic a decade later came from workers 55 and older. But not that late The outsize importance of the boomers is the result of the generation\u2019s size: Some 76 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964. By comparison, just 47 million people were born into the so-called silent generation that preceded the boomers, and 55 million into Generation X. By working just a few years longer than anticipated, the boomers helped reshape the entire labor market for a decade.\n\nSome people plan to keep working into their 70s or beyond, but many do not. The huge increase in home prices and, until last year, the stock market left many with healthy retirement accounts. Others would like to keep working but can\u2019t because of ill health or age discrimination. The pandemic, which made in-person interactions particularly dangerous for older workers, accelerated their departure from the work force. Among Americans ages 55 to 64 \u2014 the oldest members of Generation X and the youngest boomers \u2014 the share of people who are working or seeking jobs has rebounded to its prepandemic level. But for those 65 and up, that rate remains depressed. My colleague Jeanna Smialek recently talked to one couple, Alice and Howard Lieberman, who illustrate this trend. The pandemic, and the shift to hybrid instruction, led Mrs. Lieberman to retire from her teaching job earlier than planned, in her late 60s. Her husband retired, too, so they could spend their golden years together. Now, they have left work behind for good. Even without the pandemic, the Liebermans would have retired eventually. The recent decline in the work force \u201cwas baked in the cake after the baby boom that followed World War II,\u201d Aysegul Sahin, a University of Texas economist, told Jeanna. Other forces could still help counteract the retirement wave. Remote work could make it easier for people with disabilities, parents of young children and others to return to or find work. Increased immigration, if Congress were to allow it, could provide a new pool of potential workers. And the last economic recovery demonstrated the power of a strong job market to attract workers. But the economic tailwind that the boomers have generated for decades is now blowing in the other direction.\n\u2022 None Billions of dollars in federal infrastructure spending will create jobs and could avert a rise in unemployment.\n\u2022 None Powell said that elected officials, not the Federal Reserve, should set climate policies.\n\u2022 None The House voted to investigate law enforcement and national security agencies. Republicans promised to scrutinize what they see as an effort to silence conservatives.\n\u2022 None The classified documents found in President Biden\u2019s former office at a Washington think tank included information on countries from when he was vice president.\n\u2022 None Different numbers of documents, different responses: Here\u2019s how the Biden discovery compares to Donald Trump\u2019s handling of sensitive materials.\n\u2022 None Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat, is running for Dianne Feinstein\u2019s Senate seat in 2024. Feinstein, 89, hasn\u2019t said whether she will seek re-election.\n\u2022 None An 18-year-old mayor hopes to turn things around for his Arkansas city.",

We cannot simply take stock of how we might look to someone else.\n\nThis is part of the appeal of portraiture. It is not the objective reality of who we are but a version of how someone else sees us, translated onto the page or the canvas. It always astounds and moves me to think, while in art museums, that before photography, the only simple way to see a static image of yourself was through the brush or the pen or the chisel, necessarily filtered through another person\u2019s creative intelligence. Standing in front of John Singer Sargent\u2019s portrait of Gretchen Osgood Warren and her daughter, we see not just what they might have looked like but the specific things Sargent saw: the high pink of Warren\u2019s cheeks, the dreaminess of her daughter\u2019s expression, the silvery pink of her dress, the candles behind them fading in paint strokes into the background. The way her shawl trails off to the floor, gray and vague, is something only Sargent might have seen and painted.\n\nCameras have gradually made it unexceptional to see images of ourselves, but there is still something magical about having another person pay this kind of sustained creative attention to you. This is part of why people pay for boardwalk caricatures and commission portraits of themselves in oils. There is real delight in seeing how someone else sees us, experiencing a strange, maybe tenuous connection with their artistic vision. Or, perhaps, with their attention: A portrait, after all, is the fruit of intense aesthetic focus, and what could be more flattering than having that focus fixed on yourself?\n\nLensa borrows, in an impoverished way, from that appeal. But of course these images are not how another person sees us. They are the naked eye of an inhuman intelligence, combining features mathematically, lips and nose and eyes added up into an approximation of you. There is not, I think, real potential for beauty here \u2014 not because the images are produced algorithmically (I believe it is possible for computers to create compelling artwork), but because the avatars seem to me to satisfy neither realism nor artistry. They live between the two and are mostly good for evaluating, once again, versions of how we might look. Their style mimics fantasy characters, comic books and heroes, imagining you into a flattering spotlight \u2014 but even in this they fail to elevate you specifically, instead sliding your image into generic visual tropes. You could be anyone, and in fact, you are!\n\nThe fundamental appeal of apps like this is, of course, to our own self-involvement. Much has already been said about the way the internet fuels self-obsession by pushing us to perform for others: On Facebook, people announce banal life developments and political opinions; on Instagram, we interrupt our fun to show others how much fun we\u2019re having; on Twitter, we mine our personal lives for laughs. But there is also something to be said about how digital tools can function like fun-house mirrors, feeding a wholly private fascination with ourselves. I can\u2019t help staring at Lensa\u2019s hundred semireal versions of my face. (Actually, 110: There was a bonus of 10 \u201cHoliday Spirit\u201d styles, including one in which I stared down moodily while wearing a Santa hat.) I didn\u2019t share these avatars with others. Even those who did post theirs shared only a fraction of what was produced. These images seemed intended to be marveled at in private. They are like the lists people post of the year\u2019s best moments, or recollections of dreams \u2014 things that, even when shared with others, are always more interesting to ourselves.",

Kathy Hochul said she nominated Judge Hector LaSalle to become the state\u2019s top judge because he was the right person to \u201cbring a fractured court together.\u201d\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has not given up on her nomination of Hector LaSalle to lead the state Court of Appeals, but the Legislature could refuse to approve him.\n\nAllegations of racism and racial pandering. Complaints about left-wing insurgents and right-wing courts. And dire forecasts about the fate of abortion access, organized labor and legal protections for criminal defendants. It is the kind of political firestorm that typically accompanies the nomination of prospective U.S. Supreme Court justices. But this time, it is playing out in New York, in an ugly squabble that leaves Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, at risk of becoming the first governor in New York to have her nominee for the state\u2019s top judge get rejected \u2014 at the hands of her own party. Ms. Hochul\u2019s choice of Hector D. LaSalle, an appellate court justice and a former prosecutor, as her nominee for chief judge of the Court of Appeals, the state\u2019s highest court, has turned into an unexpectedly fierce battle, with an emboldened Democratic Legislature standing in the governor\u2019s way. When he was on the short list for the job last fall, the New York State Bar Association gave Justice LaSalle its highest rating, \u201cwell qualified.\u201d After his nomination, the organization\u2019s president described him as an \u201coutstanding choice,\u201d praising his \u201cremarkable intellect and deep practical knowledge of the courts.\u201d\n\nBut if the lawmakers vote as they have pledged to in recent weeks, Justice LaSalle appears to face near-certain defeat in the State Senate, which is responsible for confirming nominees \u2014 if he is even able to make it past the chamber\u2019s Judiciary Committee. The committee is expected to consider his nomination in the coming days, ahead of a Jan. 22 deadline. At issue is the judge\u2019s voting record, with a critical mass of Democrats in Albany \u2014 who hold a supermajority in the Legislature \u2014 saying he is too conservative to lead the seven-member court. The dispute has pitted a crop of Latino and other minority lawmakers \u2014 who embrace him as the state\u2019s prospective first Latino chief judge \u2014 against left-leaning lawmakers, who say that his decisions reveal stances taken against unions, reproductive choice and the rights of defendants. Justice LaSalle\u2019s defenders say the opposition has mischaracterized a handful of the judge\u2019s cases, and other Democrats have praised both his record and judicial approach. \u201cIn his 14 years on the bench and throughout his distinguished legal career in public service, Justice Hector LaSalle has established a strong record as a brilliant lawyer and a scrupulously fair and thoughtful jurist,\u201d said Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, in a statement supporting the nomination. The intraparty battle is bound to test Ms. Hochul\u2019s political strength against a State Senate that has increasingly lurched to the left and appears eager to assert its growing sway in the State Capitol. It has also raised questions about how Ms. Hochul, who appeared blindsided by the opposition, may have misjudged the shifting political winds in Albany and whether she failed to lock up sufficient support for Justice LaSalle in advance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of frustration on the left with some of the decisions coming out of the federal courts,\u201d said Jonathan Lippman, a former chief judge for the court who retired in 2015 and has voiced support for Justice LaSalle. \u201cBut you can\u2019t compare apples to oranges.\u201d Opposition to Justice LaSalle\u2019s nomination has focused on several appellate cases where he joined the majority opinion, but did not write it. Office of Governor Kathy Hochul, via Associated Press Justice LaSalle, 54, is the presiding justice of the Appellate Division of the Second Judicial Department of the New York State Supreme Court, which handles civil and criminal appeals from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Westchester and a half-dozen other counties. He was elected as a State Supreme Court justice in 2008 in Suffolk County, and in 2014, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appointed him associate justice of the appellate court he now leads. Justice LaSalle\u2019s critics have pointed to several appellate cases as evidence that he is conservative, pro-prosecutor, anti-union and anti-abortion. In those cases, the judge joined \u2014 but did not write \u2014 the majority opinion, making it difficult to discern his personal legal reasoning. In a 2014 decision, People v. Corbin, Justice LaSalle joined a majority denying a defendant\u2019s appeal of a conviction on a weapons possession charge, on the grounds that the defendant had knowingly waived the right to an appeal when he pleaded guilty to the crime two years earlier. The defendant had argued, after his plea, that the original police search had been illegal; the appeals court said that the trial record showed that the trial judge and his lawyer had correctly advised the defendant that he could not retroactively challenge evidence once he entered a guilty plea. Some organized labor groups have objected to Justice LaSalle\u2019s 2015 vote in a defamation case that arose from a lawsuit filed by Cablevision against the communications workers union and two union members over statements made in a town-hall meeting.\n\nA lower court had dismissed the case under a state law that prohibits companies from suing unions and their representatives for labor-related activities. The appeals panel agreed that the suit against the union itself must be dismissed, but said it could proceed against union representatives who had been acting on their own. In 2017, Justice LaSalle joined a unanimous opinion that ordered the New York attorney general to narrow a subpoena issued to the operator of anti-abortion \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers.\u201d The subpoena was issued as part of an investigation by former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into whether the operator, Evergreen Association, Inc., was engaged in the unauthorized practice of medicine, and sought information about the organization\u2019s promotional literature, corporate structure and staff. Evergreen challenged the subpoena as a politically motivated attack and sought to have it quashed entirely. The opinion held that some of the attorney general\u2019s demands were too broad and infringed on the organization\u2019s First Amendment rights. \u201cThere is no question that the attorney general\u2019s investigation is of the utmost importance to protecting the health and safety of women,\u201d the opinion says. \u201cHowever, it is equally important that such investigation be carried out with respect and sensitivity to the constitutional rights of those involved.\u201d Justice LaSalle\u2019s defenders have said that these cases hinged on procedural and legal matters and that the rulings did not reflect the justice\u2019s underlying beliefs. The cases \u201cdo not stand for anything that the progressives say they stand for,\u201d said Vincent Bonventre, a professor at Albany Law School who follows the Court of Appeals. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s conservative. I would say that he\u2019s not liberal. He\u2019s probably pretty moderate.\u201d Jay Jacobs, the state Democratic Party chair, said that he believed the battle over Justice LaSalle had more to do with political flexing than with the judge\u2019s legal philosophy. \u201cThe progressive left, the very progressive left, the far left, as I refer to them, determined that they wanted to use this as, in my judgment, a power play,\u201d said Mr. Jacobs, who has repeatedly come under fire from left-wing lawmakers for his stewardship of the party.\n\nMr. Jacobs added that he felt that recent election results \u2014 in particular last summer\u2019s primary, in which Ms. Hochul cruised past a progressive challenger, Jumaane Williams \u2014 gave her the right to choose whom she pleases. Some political consultants wondered why the governor did not use her leverage to help assure Mr. LaSalle\u2019s nomination and avoid an ugly public battle. The nomination was announced on Dec. 22, when the Legislature had returned to Albany to give itself a $32,000 pay raise \u2014 a move that required the governor\u2019s approval and could have been used to help her with Mr. LaSalle. By then, it was already clear that the process to replace Judge DiFiore, who was reviled by many left-wing Democrats, could devolve into a bitter fight. A group of 20 Senate Democrats indicated that they preferred a candidate who had been a civil rights lawyer or public defender. Justice LaSalle was neither; he had previously been a bureau chief in the Suffolk County district attorney\u2019s office and an assistant attorney general. The governor, however, ultimately chose him, seeing him as one of the most qualified candidates on the short list and his nomination as an opportunity to elevate a Latino to the upper echelons of state government, according to Hochul officials. The Senate must vote to accept or reject him within 30 days of his nomination. But first the judiciary committee, dominated by Democrats, must hold hearings. \u201cI don\u2019t think the nominee has the votes,\u201d said State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Democrat who chairs the committee. Ms. Stewart-Cousins also cast doubt on Mr. LaSalle\u2019s prospects, saying last week in a podcast interview with Gotham Gazette, \u201cI do not see this ending in the way that the governor wished it would.\u201d\n\nThe sheer numbers don\u2019t seem to favor Mr. LaSalle at this moment: The Judiciary recently expanded from 15 to 19 members, a change that Senate Democrats have said was routine, but that Mr. LaSalle\u2019s defenders saw as a plot to stack the committee with \u201cno\u201d votes. If the judge\u2019s nomination reaches the floor, at least a dozen of the 42 Democrats in the 63-seat State Senate have indicated that they would vote against confirming him \u2014 meaning that Ms. Hochul may have to rely on Republicans. \u201cOur conference believes he should get a fair hearing,\u201d said Senator Rob Ortt, the Republican who serves as minority leader. The governor has said she has no intention of withdrawing her nomination. \u201cI selected the very best person; Hector LaSalle has an exceptional record,\u201d Ms. Hochul said in Manhattan on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the person that\u2019ll bring a fractured court together, he\u2019ll be fair, he\u2019ll be just.\u201d A contingent of Latino leaders, including Representatives Adriano Espaillat and Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, have also rallied passionately around Justice LaSalle, organizing a Latinos for LaSalle coalition. They see Justice LaSalle\u2019s nomination as a major milestone in a state with a dearth of Latino representation at a statewide level, but it has also pitted them against a crop of mostly younger, more left-leaning Latino officials who have vocally opposed him. \u201cTo have the first Latino and Puerto Rican nominated, and to have his record distorted the way it\u2019s been distorted, I think is unfair,\u201d said Luis Sep\u00falveda, a Democrat from the Bronx who is Puerto Rican and a member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cI can\u2019t say blindly that this guy is crazy conservative the way they\u2019re trying to picture him.\u201d For his part, Judge Lippman seemed disconsolate about the characterizations of Justice LaSalle as a conservative, which he said is \u201cnothing like the person that I know.\u201d",

The days are full of ice storms, frostbite, sleet and flu \u2014 a hilariously exaggerated yet accurate take on what seems like a never-ending month. It is true that after the fa-la-la-or-else frenzy of the holidays, a dry January, a gym January or even a new-you January can feel like a shivering slog.\n\nBut maybe there\u2019s another way to look at it. What if January could be quiet and centered, a period of calm reflection when it\u2019s too cold to go out and no one wants or expects anything social from you anyway? To me this is the ideal moment to hide in your house, cozy up near the stove and simmer a nice pot of stew. Go low and slow \u2014 after all, you\u2019ve got plenty of time this month.\n\nWhat will you put into your pot? Mine is usually full of beans, sometimes white beans and sausage with herbs, sometimes with carrots, fennel and other vegetables. Veggie lovers can fill theirs with mushrooms and dumplings (above); seafood eaters might whip up a savory shrimp Creole; omnivores can indulge in a Brunswick stew laden with chicken, corn, tomatoes and lima beans, or perhaps baek kimchi jjigae, made with white kimchi and pork shoulder. There are so many possibilities.\n\nAnd that isn\u2019t the only way to cook something low and slow; there\u2019s your oven, too. Ali Slagle has a new recipe for slow-roasted sweet potatoes that she starts in a cold oven so they become even sweeter. Sue Li\u2019s superb slow-roasted salmon with mushroom-leek broth won\u2019t take as long as Ali\u2019s homey slow-roasted chicken with garlicky green beans and sage, but both recipes are equally satisfying on a cold winter evening.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAlongside a winning \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore,\u201d our critic returned to four works at the Met in the middle of their runs to hear new rotations of artists.\n\nAs the first act of Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d ends, Violetta, a high-end prostitute, is suffering the symptoms of tuberculosis. A well-to-do young man\u2019s declaration of love shakes her seen-it-all cynicism; should she put an end to her life of pleasure and accept him? Screw it, she decides: As champagne fizzes of coloratura rise and rise, she declares that she is \u201cforever free\u201d and brings the curtain down in defiance. At the Metropolitan Opera in November, the soprano Nadine Sierra sang that moment with luxuriant ease and confidence, a woman certain that she still had all the time in the world. On Sunday at the Met, though, Ermonela Jaho \u2014 her tone far less plush than Sierra\u2019s and the aria less easy for her \u2014 made it a kind of mad scene. Violetta\u2019s fragility, her sleep-when-I\u2019m-dead mania, were scarily center stage. Same words, same notes, an entirely different effect: This is one of the best parts of my job. In addition to attending first nights at the Met with other critics \u2014 as on Tuesday, when a delightful revival of \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d opened with the power to make you giggle one minute and choke up the next \u2014 I spent the last few weeks returning to four classic titles in the middle of their runs to see them with new rotations of singers.\n\nThere is not the audience there once was to hear \u201cLa Traviata\u201d twice over a couple of months. There is not even the audience there once was to hear it twice over a couple of years. Which is something to mourn. Being a lover of the performing arts is about the thirst for the new play and concerto. But it\u2019s also about relishing the Hamlet of cool distance next to the one of slovenly aggression; about how Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony can be noble or ferocious in the hands of different orchestras and conductors; about how each new soprano increases our sense of what is possible in a work, and suggests how capacious we are, too. Not that every contrast is quite as extreme as in the Met\u2019s \u201cTraviata\u201d this season. In November I had been impressed by Sierra, who in her mid-30s is coming into her own vocally. But, as in her sumptuously sung \u201cLucia di Lammermoor\u201d last year, she has not yet solved one of opera\u2019s fundamental challenges: making rich, ample tone convey desperation, illness and frailty.\n\nDesperation, illness and frailty happen to be Ermonela Jaho\u2019s stock in trade. We often hear about opera singers being larger than life onstage; Jaho manages to be smaller, to give the sense of death incarnate, a walking, singing corpse. About 15 years Sierra\u2019s senior, she has a slender, meticulous sound that she doesn\u2019t push to be bigger than it is. Her \u201cAh, fors\u2019\u00e8 lui\u201d and \u201cDite alla giovine\u201d were murmured reveries, ghosts of tone; you got the sensation of thousands of people in the audience leaning in to overhear private musings. I can\u2019t remember experiencing such prolonged passages of extremely soft yet palpable singing in the Met\u2019s huge theater, which artists often think they need to scream to fill. Jaho can be shamelessly old-school; this was probably the most coughing I\u2019d ever heard from a Violetta, and her \u201cAddio, del passato\u201d in the final act milked every wide-eyed tremble and gasp for air. She didn\u2019t summon the fullness of voice that an ideal Violetta requires, at least at certain moments. But Jaho unsettlingly lives this unsettling opera, providing a sensitive, unique vision of a classic. The tenor Ismael Jordi, making his Met debut as Alfredo this season, was on Sunday a gawky more than dashing presence, who spread mellow legato lines like schmears of cream cheese. The baritone Amartuvshin Enkhbat is also making a company debut \u2014 this one rather more impressive \u2014 as Alfredo\u2019s father, the elder Germont, with his burnished-mahogany \u201cDi Provenza il mar\u201d providing the most deeply satisfying singing of anyone onstage. In another Verdi work, \u201cRigoletto,\u201d the shift of personnel marked a less dramatic change but resulted in a keen performance. On Dec. 17, the soprano Lisette Oropesa sang Gilda with a tone a few shades brighter and more finely vibrating than the softer-grain Rosa Feola had earlier in the fall.\n\nWhen \u201cAida\u201d \u2014 yet more Verdi \u2014 opened in the beginning of December, it was one of the season\u2019s shakier efforts, with Latonia Moore struggling in the title role. Michelle Bradley had always been scheduled to take on the part in the new year, but her entrance was accelerated when Moore dropped out after the first performance. I returned on Dec. 27, and found Bradley in pleasant form: a demure, even reticent Aida. The tenor Brian Jagde was more nuanced, if also less steady, than he had been in his unrelenting first performance a few weeks earlier. The mezzo-soprano Olesya Petrova, who stayed on in the run when Anita Rachvelishvili, who was supposed to replace her, canceled after a single evening, also seemed more settled in. The most salutary change was Kelsey, who turned from Rigoletto to Amonasro, and who gave his trademark smoky tone and aura of threat to a role that, earlier in the month, George Gagnidze had rendered merely tight and querulous. In the machine that is the Met\u2019s abridged holiday presentation of Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d the baritone Benjamin Taylor, the second-cast Papageno, was the highlight on Dec. 28, his voice compact yet resonant, his charisma easygoing without being cloying. But for charm, even he couldn\u2019t beat this \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore.\u201d Donizetti\u2019s comedy is one of my favorite operas, but it can easily go awry. While laugh-out-loud funny, it is not a farce. Bartlett Sher\u2019s quaint production interpolates a bit too much physical violence, presumably to raise the emotional stakes, but understands that the piece is at heart a small, sweet romance, drawing both smiles and tears.",

            "section": "New York",
            "content": "Proposed budget cuts for the New York City public library system have stirred opposition among supporters of the beloved institution.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nNew York\u2019s public libraries could be forced to cut their hours and programming. The City Council wants to protect their funding in the next budget battle.\n\nDuring his first year as mayor, Eric Adams said he was focused on ensuring that city government served the working-class New Yorkers who helped elect him. But now he is under fire for cutting funding for libraries \u2014 a critical lifeline for people who do not have internet access at home or who need after-school tutoring and English language instruction. The proposed cuts of $13 million this fiscal year and more than $20 million next year have sparked concern among families, elected officials and library leaders. Libraries could respond to the trimmed budget by scaling back hours, workers or programming. With more than 200 locations across the city, the public library system is a beloved institution where children learn to love books and recently arrived migrants become acclimated to their new home. Before the pandemic, city libraries typically saw about 35 million annual visitors, and many New Yorkers have started to return.\n\nLibrary leaders raised the alarm about the budget cuts at a recent City Council hearing, which Gothamist first reported. Anthony W. Marx, president of the New York Public Library, said that worrying about where to cut was keeping him up at night, and library leaders added that their services were needed more than ever following the disruption of the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019d have no choice but to do less, and that would be a great shame for the city,\u201d said Nick Buron, the chief librarian at the Queens Public Library. City Council leaders are gearing up for a battle with Mr. Adams about his cuts to libraries and other programs like free preschool for 3-year-olds and funding for the City University of New York. A group of 13 left-leaning council members called the mayor\u2019s recent budget adjustments \u201ccruel and dangerous\u201d and argued that they would make the city less stable. Adrienne Adams, the City Council speaker, said in an interview that the Council would oppose cuts to key services during the next budget cycle, which will begin in earnest on Thursday when Mayor Adams is expected to release his preliminary budget for the next fiscal year. \u201cThe Council has a different vision for our city,\u201d said Ms. Adams. \u201cIt focuses on investing in the essential services that our communities rely on to be healthy and safe and that really address the root causes of our greatest challenges.\u201d\n\nMs. Adams, who is not related to the mayor, has been increasingly critical of Mr. Adams, even though they are both relatively moderate Democrats from Queens. They have had public disagreements over his budget cuts to schools and his handling of the migrant crisis. As he enters his second year in office, Mr. Adams has argued that broad cuts are necessary across city agencies to address a dismal financial forecast. The city is expected to have a deficit of nearly $3 billion next year as federal pandemic aid ends and tax revenue falters. In an interview, Mr. Adams said he took \u201cno joy\u201d in cutting money for schools and libraries but that it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d for him not to reduce city spending. \u201cWe made tough fiscal decisions in spite of the people who continually attacked us for it, but the decision was right for New Yorkers,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Amaris Cockfield, said in a statement that the Adams administration valued \u201cthe important role libraries play in our community\u201d and would work with library leaders to \u201cimplement savings initiatives in a way that does not reduce services to New Yorkers.\u201d The city spends roughly $400 million annually on public libraries \u2014 a small fraction of its $100 billion budget. During the city\u2019s last financial downturn, under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, funding for libraries was constantly under threat.\n\nJohn Hyslop, the president of a union that represents library workers in Queens, said he was worried that the city would close libraries on Saturdays as it had considered doing during past budget battles. He said that it was difficult during the Bloomberg years for libraries to plan for the future with so much uncertainty, and that the situation improved under Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cBill de Blasio benefited from a booming economy, but he didn\u2019t play games with our budget,\u201d Mr. Hyslop said.\n\nThe City Council often acted as the \u201csavior\u201d for libraries, Mr. Hyslop said: \u201cThat\u2019s who we have to rely on to come bail us out.\u201d The last few years have been tumultuous for New York City\u2019s libraries. They were closed for months at the height of the pandemic and then offered \u201cgrab and go\u201d books after they partially reopened. Toddler story times that were once boisterous events went virtual. As branches began to fully reopen in 2021, city libraries eliminated all late fees in an effort to get people to return. At a time when the city is seeing record homelessness, libraries serve an important role, often offering shelter during the day as well as internet access. Chi Oss\u00e9, a City Council member from Brooklyn who chairs the committee that oversees libraries, said he wanted to vote down the mayor\u2019s budget modification from December that included the additional cuts for libraries. \u201cIt would be really detrimental,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve trimmed so much fat already.\u201d But Ms. Adams, the Council speaker, said on Tuesday that the Council decided not to bring the budget modification to a vote. She framed the move as a \u201crebuke\u201d of the mayor\u2019s cuts while still preserving funding for nonprofits that could have been blocked. Without a yes-or-no vote, the $13 million in cuts to libraries for this year will take effect.\n\nMs. Adams, who once served on the board of the Queens Public Library, said she viewed libraries as \u201cintergenerational beacons\u201d and would work hard to spare them from further cuts. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how passionate I am about making sure that our libraries are intact,\u201d she said. Mr. Marx, the head of the New York Public Library, said in a statement on Tuesday that the budget cuts would \u201churt our patrons and the communities we serve\u201d and that he would \u201ccontinue our talks with Mayor Adams and the City Council to preserve our levels of funding.\u201d The Bronx Library Center, the largest public library in the Bronx, was busy on a recent afternoon. Dozens of people waited in the basement for English classes or to apply for an IDNYC card, a municipal identification card that is often used by immigrants. The library has been a welcome center for a recent wave of migrants arriving from the Mexican border, and long lines start to form outside the library an hour before it opens in the morning.\n\nSadou Barry, an immigrant from Senegal, arrived hoping to join an English writing class. He said he started coming to the library a few months ago to study English grammar books. \u201cIt gives us a chance to have an opportunity,\u201d he said. Melvin Nunez, 17, said he visited the library when he was bored and wanted to get away from home, and that it felt like a refuge. He read \u201cDeadpool\u201d comic books and worked on his homework. \u201cI get some places need to get some cuts, but I don\u2019t believe that it should be something so important to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cLibraries are very important things for the community.\u201d",

Vikings who lived in the area used a rainbow of colors \u2014 red, blue, yellow, green, pink, purple \u2014 when making textiles, shields and ship sails thousands of years ago. Centuries later, the Danish architect Verner Panton made vibrant shades of orange and violet a hallmark of his furniture and interiors. Even Arne Jacobsen, the architect and interior designer whose midcentury modern Egg and Swan chairs advanced the minimalist style of decorating, occasionally favored maximalist elements of Denmark\u2019s past. Mr. Jacobsen made the Egg and Swan chairs in 1958 as part of a project to design the original interiors at the SAS Royal Hotel in Copenhagen, where he decorated rooms in teal bedspreads and curtains with a graphic pattern of semicircles. (As Mr. Manville put it, Mr. Jacobsen\u2019s vision for the hotel, which is now a Radisson, did not include \u201ca white room.\u201d)\n\nWhen he was at Georg Jensen, which was founded in 1904, he began an initiative to reproduce some of the company\u2019s stainless-steel wares in color. Finding the right palettes took time, said Mr. Manville, who now oversees the home division at Moda Operandi, the online luxury goods retailer. One of those wares, the Koppel pitcher, was released last year in cobalt blue, pistachio green and other hues, under the direction of Georg Jensen\u2019s current creative director, Ragnar Hjartarson. The colors chosen for the pitcher came from original product sketches done in the 1950s. Georg Jensen introduced the colorful Koppel pitchers as other heritage Danish brands started to offer their own vibrant takes on classic pieces. Louis Poulsen, a lighting maker, released its PH 5 pendant lamp in new pastels last September, about three years after it introduced the lamp in orange and green hues. And in 2020, the china manufacturer Lyngby released its Rhombe pattern, a style created in 1961, in colors including cobalt blue, mustard yellow and pink. A resurgence in bold Danish d\u00e9cor has been even more noticeable in emerging brands, whose founders described their work as an antidote to the subdued sensibility that has long pervaded their culture. In Denmark and other Scandinavian countries, a conduct code known as janteloven encourages blending in over standing out. \u201cDenmark had become this decorative no-go land,\u201d said Arne Jensen, a drapery designer who started his line, Arne Aksel, in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a white or gray or beige box for what \u2014 20, 25 years? I think people have had enough.\u201d\n\nMr. Jensen, 59, specializes in floor-to-ceiling curtains in sumptuous textiles (satin, corduroy, velvet) that are sold in colors including maroon, yellow-gold and a rich-looking green called \u201cmoney.\u201d Pernille Rosenkilde, 32, an influencer and stylist, had the drapes made in a semi-sheer, peach-colored fabric for the bedroom of her apartment in Copenhagen\u2019s Vesterbro neighborhood. Though Arne Askel is also based in Copenhagen, its curtains have \u201can Italian or French feeling,\u201d she said. Helle Mardahl, who in 2018 started a namesake line of vases, tableware, lamps and other decorative objects made of sherbet-colored blown glass, said her pieces were the opposite of the d\u00e9cor in the house where she grew up in Ballerup, Denmark.\n\nThe same could be said for Reflections Copenhagen, which sells surrealist mirrors shaped like lips and eyes as well as candleholders, book ends and tables made of vividly colored crystal. While Denmark is known for producing blown glassware, \u201cthere\u2019s no tradition here of fine crystal, and certainly not fun crystal,\u201d said Andrea Larsson, 50, who started the company with Julie Hugau in 2015. (Ms. Hugau left the business in 2020.) Last fall, Reflections expanded its wares to include porcelain plates in multicolor patterns. That same season, Akua, a company in Copenhagen that designs colorful blown-glass pieces made on the island of Murano near Venice, debuted its first collection.\n\n\u201cEmotions are rarely minimalistic or muted, and our designs reflect that,\u201d said Annika Agerled, 30, who oversees design at Akua, which she founded with Josefine Arthur. Ms. Agerled noted that younger d\u00e9cor brands like hers had followed in the footsteps of Hay, the Danish company founded in 2002 that offers a range of playful home furnishings designed by various makers. (In 2019, the American furniture conglomerate Herman Miller acquired a majority ownership stake in Hay.) Herle Jarlgaard, who in 2018 started the online home goods retailer FindersKeepers in Copenhagen with Rasmus Edlund, said that some of Denmark\u2019s emerging decorative artists introduced their lines after contemporary Danish fashion labels like Henrik Vibskov, Stine Goya and Ganni started making pieces that favored bright prints and patterns over monochrome palettes. Such clothes helped to spur an \u201coutbreak of self-expression,\u201d Ms. Jarlgaard, 35, said. \u201cWomen who\u2019d always just worn light or dark layers put on flowing floral dresses. They looked so free!\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWith a harsh winter putting sweeping offensives on hold, the war has shifted back to bloody battles of attrition like the one for the small city of Bakhmut and the smaller town of Soledar.\n\nKYIV \u2014 The head of a Russian mercenary group fighting in Ukraine claimed on Tuesday that his fighters had seized the town of Soledar, the site of brutal combat recently, which if true would mark the first significant Russian victory after months of setbacks. In a statement on the Telegram app, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin said troops of his Wagner Group were in control throughout the town, characterizing the remaining fighting as a mop-up operation \u2014 a claim that could not immediately be verified and was not confirmed by Ukraine. \u201cA cauldron has been formed in the center of the city, in which urban battles are being fought,\u201d Mr. Prigozhin said. Earlier in the day, Britain\u2019s defense ministry said in its daily intelligence update that Russian forces were likely in control of most of Soledar after four days of particularly intense fighting, with heavy casualties, against fierce Ukrainian resistance.\n\nIn a bloody back-and-forth over a small patch of territory, Soledar had become the focal point of Russia\u2019s monthslong campaign to seize the city of Bakhmut several miles to the southwest. The Kremlin has made Bakhmut, in turn, the centerpiece of its drive to occupy all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region, devoting resources and spilling blood there out of proportion to the city\u2019s size. The battle highlights the war\u2019s return to grinding attrition in the last two months, after a period of swift offensives over wide swaths of land. The fighting in Soledar has also brought national and international attention to a small town that was previously best known for its cavernous salt mine. \u201cEverything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said of Soledar in his Monday night video address. He asked the same question many analysts and experts were posing: \u201cWhat did Russia want to gain there?\u201d One answer may lie in the agenda of the Wagner Group and what it hopes to gain in terms of reputation if it manages to seize Soledar and even Bakhmut. It would allow the Russians \u2014 and Wagner \u2014 to claim at least a small triumph for their troubled war effort.\n\nBut more mobile operations are expected to return in the coming months, and Ukraine\u2019s intense lobbying for its allies to provide armored vehicles appears to be paying off. Britain\u2019s government confirmed on Tuesday that it is considering sending some of its Challenger II tanks to Ukraine \u2014 they would be the first Western main battle tanks supplied to Kyiv\u2019s forces \u2014 while Ukraine continues to press Germany for its Leopard II tanks. Last week, France, Germany and the United States all agreed to send armored fighting vehicles, which are less heavily armed and armored than tanks, to Ukraine for the first time. Russia has repeatedly warned the United States and its allies against sending more sophisticated weapons to Ukraine, calling it a provocation or escalation. Western officials have been wary of being drawn more deeply into the conflict, determined not to get involved in a direct confrontation with Russia, and continue to refuse combat aircraft and long-range missiles requested by Ukraine. But one taboo after another has fallen. After months of debate, the Biden administration has agreed to send a battery of the most advanced American air defense system, the Patriot missile, and Germany has said it will supply another. U.S. officials said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops would travel to Fort Sill in Oklahoma for training in using the Patriot, a complex system that can require close to 100 people to operate. A challenge throughout the war has been teaching Ukrainians to use unfamiliar weapons systems, and most of that training has taken place in Germany. The arrival of more tanks for Ukraine\u2019s embattled forces would come just in time. After nearly a year of heavy fighting, much of Kyiv\u2019s armored fleet has been worn down and is in desperate need of repair and replacement. Some Ukrainian units have suffered so many vehicle losses that captured Russian tanks make up large chunks of their inventory.\n\nUkrainian officials, while acknowledging the intensity of the battle in the Bakhmut area, have also suggested that losing the city to Russian forces would not be a major setback. Mr. Zelensky, in his overnight address, emphasized the broader goal of retaking all the Russian-occupied territory. \u201cThe result of this difficult and long battle will be the liberation of our entire Donbas,\u201d he said.

            "content": "Republicans, back in control of a chamber of Congress, are poised once again to leverage the debt limit to make fiscal demands of President Biden.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIf Congress fails to increase the government\u2019s borrowing limit in time, the result would be a shock to the economy and financial markets.\n\nThe U.S. Hit the Debt Ceiling. What Does That Mean and What Happens Now?\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Washington and Wall Street are bracing for a revival of brinkmanship over the nation\u2019s statutory debt limit, raising fears that the fragile U.S. economy could be rattled by a calamitous self-inflicted wound. For years, Republicans have sought to tie spending cuts or other concessions from Democrats to their votes to lift the borrowing cap, even if it means eroding the world\u2019s faith that the United States will always pay its bills. Now, back in control of a chamber of Congress, Republicans are poised once again to leverage the debt limit to make fiscal demands of President Biden. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned on Friday that she would have to undertake \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to continue paying the nation\u2019s bills beyond January if lawmakers did not act to raise the debt limit \u2014 and that her powers to delay a default could be exhausted by early June. The fight over the debt limit is renewing debates about what the actual consequences would be if the United States were unable to borrow money to pay its bills, including what it owes to the bondholders who own U.S. Treasury debt and essentially provide a line of credit to the government.\n\nSome Republicans argue that the ramifications of breaching the debt limit and defaulting are overblown. Democrats and the White House \u2014 along with a variety of economists and forecasters \u2014 warn of dire scenarios that include a shutdown of basic government functions, a hobbled public health system, and a deep and painful financial crisis. Speaker Kevin McCarthy signaled that he and his fellow Republicans would seek to use the debt limit standoff to enact spending cuts and reduce the national debt. He said that lawmakers very likely had until summertime to find a solution before the United States runs out of cash, a threshold that is known as \u201cX-date.\u201d \u201cOne of the greatest threats we have to this nation is our debt,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said on Fox News, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to just have this runaway spending.\u201d\n\nThat has introduced the very real likelihood of a debt limit breach. \u201cFiscal deadlines will pose a greater risk this year than they have for a decade,\u201d economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling, also called the debt limit, is a cap on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow via U.S. Treasury securities, such as bills and savings bonds, to fulfill its financial obligations. Because the United States runs budget deficits, it must borrow huge sums of money to pay its bills. The limit has been hit. What now? America hit its technical debt limit on Jan. 19. The Treasury Department will now begin using \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to continue paying the government\u2019s obligations. These measures are essentially fiscal accounting tools that curb certain government investments so that the bills continue to be paid. Those options could be exhausted by June. What is at stake? Once the government exhausts its extraordinary measures and runs out of cash, it would be unable to issue new debt and pay its bills. The government could wind up defaulting on its debt if it is unable to make required payments to its bondholders. Such a scenario would be economically devastating and could plunge the globe into a financial crisis. Can the government do anything to forestall disaster? There is no official playbook for what Washington can do. But options do exist. The Treasury could try to prioritize payments, such as paying bondholders first. If the United States does default on its debt, which would rattle the markets, the Federal Reserve could theoretically step in to buy some of those Treasury bonds. Why is there a limit on U.S. borrowing? According to the Constitution, Congress must authorize borrowing. The debt limit was instituted in the early 20th century so that the Treasury would not need to ask for permission each time it had to issue debt to pay bills. Here\u2019s a look at what the debt limit is and why it matters. What is the debt limit? The debt limit is a cap on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow to fulfill its financial obligations. Because the United States runs budget deficits \u2014 meaning it spends more than it brings in through taxes and other revenue \u2014 it must borrow huge sums of money to pay its bills. That includes funding for social safety net programs, interest on the national debt and salaries for troops. After a protracted standoff in late 2021, Congress agreed to raise the borrowing cap to $31 trillion. Although the debt ceiling debate often elicits calls by lawmakers to cut back on government spending, lifting the debt limit does not authorize any new spending and in fact simply allows the United States to finance existing obligations. In other words, it allows the government to pay the bills it has already incurred. When will we hit the borrowing cap? Ms. Yellen\u2019s declaration that a default could loom as early as June signaled that there was less time to resolve the matter than some had estimated even recently. Analysts at Goldman Sachs had put the date around August. The Bipartisan Policy Center, which closely tracks the debt limit deadline, projected last summer that the X-date would likely arrive no sooner than the third quarter of 2023.\n\nWhat happens if we actually go over that cliff? Just approaching a breach of the debt limit can hurt the economy. In 2011, congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama engaged in a standoff over spending and debt that was resolved just in time to avoid hitting the limit. That brinkmanship rattled investors, consumers and business owners, with concrete consequences. Stock prices plunged \u2014 and volatility in the market spiked \u2014 as lawmakers approached a debt limit breach. They did not recover for half a year. The cost of borrowing for corporations, which fluctuates with the level of risk that investors perceive in the economy, jumped substantially. That made it more expensive for companies to borrow to make new investments. Mortgage rates spiked similarly, hampering prospective home buyers. The credit agency S&P downgraded America\u2019s credit rating for the first time. Consumer confidence and small-business optimism both plunged during the crisis, as well. An actual breach would be far worse, economists warn. If the Treasury Department is unable to make payments to lenders who hold federal debt \u2014 what is known as a default \u2014 investors would demand much higher interest rates in the future to loan money to the government. It would be similar to what happens when borrowers miss credit card payments \u2014 their credit ratings go down, and the interest rate they pay often goes up. Such a scenario would add drastically to the government\u2019s interest payments, which the White House projects will cost the equivalent of 2.6 percent of the total American economy over the next decade, further squeezing the federal budget. It would also threaten to destabilize bond markets globally because U.S. Treasury bonds are largely seen as one of the safest investments in the world. That spiral would most likely occur even if the government maintains its payments to bondholders but is unable to pay other bills, like salaries for federal workers.\n\nPerhaps most immediately damaging to an already fragile U.S. recovery, the government would pull a huge amount of spending power out of the economy overnight if it breached the borrowing limit. By choosing not to pay some combination of Social Security checks, federal workers, bondholders and more, the government would be immediately killing the equivalent of one-tenth of American economic activity, Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated. \u201cIt\u2019s a large amount,\u201d said Alec Phillips, Goldman\u2019s chief political economist. \u201cYou just take 10 percent of the economy out of play for a bit until you resolve it.\u201d Researchers at Third Way, a Democratic think tank, estimated in December that a debt limit breach could kill up to three million jobs, add $130,000 to the cost of an average 30-year mortgage and balloon the national debt by an additional $850 billion.\n\nWhat are the options to avoid catastrophe? As a first step, to ward off default, Ms. Yellen said she would begin suspending new investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, and suspending reinvestment in the Government Securities Investment Fund of the Federal Employees Retirement System\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan to avoid breaching the debt limit. In the past, Treasury officials have discussed trying to prioritize certain payments \u2014 like military salaries \u2014 or delaying payments entirely for a certain period until the government has sufficient revenue to cover all of its bills. Either scenario would cause chaos in the financial markets and set off legal challenges. In late 2021, about a dozen officials in the department\u2019s Office of Fiscal Projections were tracking the size and timing of the nation\u2019s inflows and outflows of money to refine its estimates for the so-called X-date. They kept close tabs on fluctuations in nonmarketable debt, such as savings bonds, and coordinated closely with government agencies to determine their spending needs.\n\nJerome H. Powell, who is now the Fed\u2019s chair, once called the possibility of purposely buying defaulted Treasury debt \u201cloathsome.\u201d When the debt ceiling again emerged as a problem in 2013, Mr. Powell, who was then a Fed governor, worried that the central bank might make default more likely by advertising that it had a solid plan for dealing with one. \u201cIf it actually looks like a good game plan, then it will make it less likely that the Congress will feel enough pressure to actually raise the ceiling,\u201d he warned in a strategy call that October. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say today what I would and wouldn\u2019t do, if we have to actually deal with a catastrophe on this.\u201d Could such crises be averted in the future? Ms. Yellen has dismissed the viability of theoretical ideas to raise the debt limit, such as minting a trillion-dollar coin. But she has called for abolishing the statutory debt limit entirely, warning that the borrowing cap was \u201cdestructive\u201d to the U.S. economy and arguing that it was blocking the federal government from spending money that Congress had already authorized. Thus far, that recommendation has gone unheeded by Congress. Doing away with the debt limit, it seems, is even harder than raising it.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn off-season of three contract agreements, all in the hundreds of millions of dollars, finished as he was reintroduced by the Twins.\n\nIt was free agency disguised as a teen-drama series: hookups and breakups, jilted suitors, broken promises, whirlwind courtships on both coasts. The saga of Carlos Correa\u2019s next contract seemed so implausible \u2014 deals with three teams, each worth hundreds of millions of dollars, all in a 30-day span \u2014 that it must have been fiction. And perhaps it was all just a dream, a swirl of unfinished plotlines that ended up in the same place. On Wednesday, Correa rubbed his eyes, looked around and saw Minnesota. Again. He seemed to like the view. \u201cKylo is going to grow up to be Minnesota Nice, which I love, and we\u2019re very excited,\u201d Correa said, spotting his 13-month-old son in the crowd at a news conference at Target Field. \u201cI get more Jucy Lucys, also.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 13, Boras reached a 13-year, $350 million agreement for Correa with the San Francisco Giants, pending a physical exam. A week later, on the eve of a scheduled news conference, the Giants still had not made the deal official. They were concerned about Correa\u2019s right leg, which was surgically repaired in 2014. Boras then pivoted to the Mets, whose owner, Steven A. Cohen, agreed to pay Correa $315 million for 12 years \u2014 again, pending a physical exam. The Mets, it turned out, were just as wary as the Giants, and conversations about reworking the deal stretched into the new year. Fortunately for Correa, his old team was indeed Minnesota Nice: As Correa spanned the country looking for a new home, the Twins left the light on for him. \u201cI do feel fortunate to be sitting here today,\u201d said Derek Falvey, the Twins\u2019 president of baseball operations. \u201cBut it was always part of our mission from that point forward, when we found out there was potential uncertainty around the first landing spot, that we could figure out a way to bring him back here.\u201d\n\nBoras could confidently cite Correa\u2019s durability; he had played in 342 of a possible 384 games since the start of the 2020 season. But the 2014 injury, which occurred when Correa was a 19-year-old Class A prospect and caught his spikes while sliding, had surprising staying power as an issue. Correa had a fractured fibula and ligament damage from the incident, but his leg has been sound ever since. \u201cIt was shocking to me, because since I had the surgery, I never missed a game, I\u2019ve never gotten treatment on my ankle, my ankle\u2019s never hurt,\u201d Correa said, adding later, \u201cThroughout that whole month when people were speculating, I was running sprints, I was working out, I was taking ground balls, I was hitting. So it was more funny to me.\u201d Boras said the Twins\u2019 medical director, Christopher Camp, had a better understanding of Correa\u2019s \u201cfunctional fitness\u201d than surgeons who might base their opinions strictly on magnetic resonance imaging exams. The Mets were in no mood to elaborate Wednesday. General Manager Billy Eppler declined an interview request, and the team issued only a terse statement that was almost comical in its brevity: \u201cWe were unable to reach an agreement. We wish Carlos all the best.\u201d Correa, who would have played third base in Queens, was something of a luxury item for the Mets, who went 101-61 last season and retained all of their starting position players from the postseason. But the Mets\u2019 inability to finalize the deal cost them a highly motivated star who spoke openly Wednesday of wanting to reach the Hall of Fame.\n\nCorrea, 28, said he knew he needed many more productive seasons to get there. But as the Twins pointed out in a tweet after the news conference, Correa is off to a strong start: Only three shortstops in the expansion era (since 1961) have more wins above replacement through age 27 \u2014 Alex Rodriguez and the Hall of Famers Robin Yount and Cal Ripken Jr. Falvey said the Twins\u2019 familiarity with Correa made them comfortable with the risk of the deal, which could stretch to 10 years and $270 million based on options triggered by plate appearances or awards in the prior season. \u201cThis was us trying to balance some of the information we have and we\u2019ve learned through this process, but also our belief in the athlete, how he prepares, how he goes about his work on a daily basis,\u201d Falvey said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen in terms of taking care of himself and influencing others to take care of themselves in a way that\u2019s special and different.\u201d Minnesota finished 78-84 last season but spent 108 days atop the American League Central before the Cleveland Guardians passed them for good in early September. Correa said he had stayed in regular contact with teammates and staff, and spoke hopefully of winning a championship. If he does carry the Twins to the World Series \u2014 they have not been since 1991, three years before Correa was born \u2014 fans may forget his free-agent wanderings. In the spirit of Minnesota Nice, they may already forgive. \u201cAll that matters is that I\u2019m here,\u201d Correa said. \u201cI\u2019m going to represent the city. I\u2019m going to represent the organization. I\u2019m going to do it the right way.\u201d",

And on Friday night at a West Hollywood hotel bar, it was Steve Buscemi. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be so rude,\u201d said the 65-year-old actor, who sidled up to our table during an interview to say hello to Hsu. It turned out that Buscemi was a major fan of \u201cEverything Everywhere,\u201d the sci-fi hit in which Hsu plays the unhappy daughter of Michelle Yeoh\u2019s multiverse-skipping savior: He\u2019d seen the movie multiple times, including at an actors guild screening earlier that evening. Hsu, 32, is often stopped by people who love \u201cEverything Everywhere,\u201d but this was a pinch-me moment that she met with a big grin. Buscemi asked for a picture, and the buoyant Hsu leaped out of our booth to pose with him, then returned to her dirty martini. \u201cThat was crazy,\u201d she told me after he left. \u201cIt\u2019s all crazy!\u201d Though the film came out nearly a year ago, its award-season afterlife has proved so potent that \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d has begun to sound less like a title and more like the organizing principle of Hsu\u2019s day planner. On the day we met, she had just completed several interviews and a pit stop at the Palm Springs International Film Festival; a few days later, she\u2019d attend the Golden Globes, where her co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan and Yeoh were all nominated and where the latter two won major awards.\n\nHsu was not nominated for a Globe, and as the ensemble\u2019s least-known member, she has sometimes been left out of the awards conversation, though she did receive a Screen Actors Guild nomination on Wednesday morning. Funny and refreshingly honest, Hsu understands that nothing is guaranteed this awards season, and many may see her as an underdog. \u201cThe elephant in the room,\u201d she said, \u201cis the dark horse of me.\u201d Still, even if Hsu isn\u2019t as famous as her veteran co-stars, her presence is no less pivotal. In \u201cEverything Everywhere,\u201d Hsu plays Joy, who is crestfallen that her mother, a Chinese American laundromat owner named Evelyn (Yeoh), makes so little effort to understand her. It\u2019s crucial that we feel for Joy because we soon learn that in every other universe but ours, she\u2019s a flashy, universe-collapsing supervillain named Jobu whom our Evelyn is charged with defeating. Hsu drew a map to track how fed-up Joy became the nihilistic Jobu, and tried to imbue her baddie with a strong emotional core: Underneath it all, this is a supervillain who wants nothing more than to be embraced by her mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m witnessing other people\u2019s humanity in a way that is very alive,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, we did that. We did something that made people start crying even when they think about it.\u2019 And that\u2019s crazy. That came from our labor of love.\u201d Inside the World of \u2018Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019 In this mind-expanding, idiosyncratic take on the superhero film, a laundromat owner is the focus of a grand, multiversal showdown.\n\u2022 None Review: Our film critic called \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d Our film critic called \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d an exuberant swirl of genre anarchy\n\u2022 None The Protagonist: Over the years, Michelle Yeoh has built her image as a combat expert.

Two of the most talked-about movies of 2022, \u201cEverything Everywhere\u201d and \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d delve into nihilism through conceptual foodstuffs. What they do next is surprising Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. It\u2019s been almost a year since \u201cEverything Everywhere\u201d came out, and you\u2019re still going. How does it feel at this late date? A whole pandemic happened between when we filmed and now, so it\u2019s kind of surreal. Obviously, it\u2019s my first time on a press run like this, and it\u2019s been wild, but so many people haven\u2019t actually seen the movie yet, and it\u2019s been really delightful to still bring it into people\u2019s lives. I think its superpower is to somehow be able to make you feel a part of the mess of humanity again. To feel those roller-coaster feelings beside a stranger is a special thing. This script came to you shortly after you wrapped the third season of \u201cMrs. Maisel,\u201d which you shot alongside \u201cBe More Chill.\u201d Did you feel ready for it? That was the first year where I finally admitted to myself that I was an actor. I\u2019ve always been a little bit punk rock \u2014 probably in an impostor syndrome way \u2014 where everything always felt like an accident: How did I stumble onto Broadway? How did I stumble onto this TV show? And to do a show on top of that, it asked so much of my discipline and rigor that I was like, \u201cOK, this is what I do.\u201d And with that came a lot of responsibility and weight.\n\nBefore you had those stage and screen roles, you spent a lot of time doing experimental theater. Do you think you were rejecting the mainstream because you thought it might reject you? At the time when I was finishing school and living in New York, those roles were not available in the mainstream. And I had no interest in selling myself or just shrinking myself to an inappropriate cameo just so that I could say I added one more thing to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I remember in 2012, I went into a commercial audition and they were like, \u201cOK, could you do it again, but with a more Asian accent?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but this role is not for me. I don\u2019t do that and I\u2019m not interested in this part.\u201d I walked out and I was fuming. I sat next to this actor and asked him, \u201cDid they ask you to do an accent?\u201d He was Asian and spoke perfect English, and he was like, \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d And he said, \u201cI have no other choice.\u201d I understand that people want to make it and they only see one path and have to bend and fold to have a life in the arts, but I always thought if that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go for me, then I\u2019m going to work at a bar or in a wood shop. I have to make things that matter to me. Life is too short to completely dehumanize yourself. When you came on board \u201cEverything Everywhere,\u201d did you think about how the movie would resonate for people who also don\u2019t tend to see themselves onscreen? I knew the movie was going to be special, but I had no idea it was going to do what it has done. And it\u2019s been really healing for me to hear how many people have been affected by it. So many daughters and mothers have been coming to me crying, saying, \u201cI saw myself in the movie,\u201d or \u201cMy relationship with my mother is just like that.\u201d\n\nWhen you say that it\u2019s been healing, what was it healing in you? I don\u2019t know if I could ever make this film again because at that point in my life, I had nothing to lose. There really were no eyes on me, so I got to bring everything I value as an artist into that role, and the affirmation I have received has validated that the wildness and imagination inside of me is really resonating with a large mass of people. Your directors, Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, said this awards season has been emotional for the cast and crew. How have you experienced it? At the Gotham Awards, [the \u201cT\u00e1r\u201d director] Todd Field said we have to eradicate the word \u201cbest\u201d when we talk about how we value art, and I felt that so deeply. But also on the same evening, when Ke won best supporting actor, I stood up so fast and screamed so loud that I almost passed out. And then when we won best picture, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m not sentimental about this kind of stuff and yet I could not stop crying onstage. Why do you think you reacted that way? Even as a kid with ideas, I just never thought it could be me up there with my friends, making something I believe in that is being celebrated. I remember sitting in front of a TV when Halle Berry won at the Oscars \u2014 the only woman of color who\u2019s ever won best actress \u2014 and I don\u2019t remember anyone else who won that night, but I remember that moment. I\u2019ve been reflecting on that a lot, because I didn\u2019t realize how much I had deleted the possibility from my mind that I could actually ever be a part of this industry in a real way, doing something that I value and love. So to get to be there and feel this big hug from our peers felt completely surreal. I\u2019m still processing all of it. I\u2019m trying to allow myself to also feel vulnerable in this ride, because there are highs and there are definitely a lot of lows. I think the biggest thing I\u2019ve been trying to balance is how to genuinely receive the goodness while not protecting myself too much that I can\u2019t enjoy the ride. It\u2019s a sweet, sweet moment that may never come again. But also, you can\u2019t get attached to the sweetness, because then you start chasing something that\u2019s not real.\n\nTell me more about those highs and lows. After Jamie Lee Curtis saw the movie at South by Southwest, she took me aside and said, \u201cThis year is going to be a total roller coaster for you. Center yourself.\u201d And I remember thinking, \u201cJamie, listen, I\u2019m a grown-ass woman and I\u2019ve been around the block. I know how to stay centered.\u201d But as the year has unfolded, I\u2019ve realized how little I knew about anything. You have to hold onto your self-worth in such a profound way, and it\u2019s hard, because it feels like other people\u2019s opinions of you are going to affirm whether or not you get to keep making movies, which is such a crazy trap and also very real, right? But I\u2019ve had to continue to remind myself that I got to this moment without anyone ever knowing anything about me, so it really is just all about the work. And it\u2019s work that people are responding to with a lot of passion. Yeah, but this industry is weird. You have moments like the one we just had with Steve Buscemi, and then you also have moments where you walk on a carpet and people are like, \u201cLana Condor, Lana Condor!\u201d It was just once, but it was very pronounced. In everybody\u2019s defense, my mom also thinks I look like Lana Condor: She sent me a picture of Lana Condor a year ago and was like, \u201cYou look like this woman.\u201d But after the Lana Condor thing happened, we were at a screening in New York, and a bunch of people kept going up to my publicist and the Daniels\u2019 publicist, who are both Asian, and they were like, \u201cCongratulations, your performance is incredible.\u201d And they were like, \u201cHuh?\u201d So listen, this ride is amazing, but that is real. We have not transcended this moment, right? James Hong [who plays Yeoh\u2019s father] started acting at a time when people wouldn\u2019t even say his name, they would literally just call him \u201cChinaman\u201d and say \u201cGet on your mark.\u201d Michelle waited almost 40 years for her first chance of being No. 1 on the call sheet, and Ke left acting for [nearly] 20 years. As successful as this film has been, the biggest fear on the other side is \u201cWhat if this is my last chance?\u201d How different are you now than you were a year ago? The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from this past year is how to continue to show up for myself. This is not something I ever thought I would be in the conversation for, but I know I brought something to this project that is completely singular. Sometimes, things have made me want to just completely disappear into the background, but there are people who felt something in this character, people who are rooting for roles like this to exist, people who are rooting, also, for me to elbow more space or even just to stand here. And so it really is the masses that have been continuing to push me forward to show up for myself. Because as confusing as all of this is, I am so proud of our movie and what I was able to bring to it, and proud for it to be my big introduction to what I believe art can or should be. Whether that is clean enough for people to digest, that\u2019s a whole other story.",

            "content": "Butler ended with 35 points, yet needed only six field goals (on 17 shots) to reach that total.\n\nThe Heat broke a record that was held by two teams. The Utah Jazz shot 39 for 39 in 1982 (Danny Schayes was 14 for 14), tying a mark first set by the 1953 Fort Wayne Pistons (the Stuyvesant High School and Columbia University graduate and eventual convicted point shaver Jack Molinas was 11 for 11).\n\nThere have been a couple of close calls. In 2000, the Indiana Pacers were 40 for 41 (Jermaine O\u2019Neal missed one). In 1950, the Washington Capitols were 44 for 45. Dick O\u2019Keefe missed his only free throw, and the team folded before the season was over. Those two things were not related, probably.\n\nIn terms of free throws made, 40 is far from the record. That was set by the Phoenix Suns in 1990 when they shot 61 for 80. Though Suns fans were treated to a free-throw bonanza that night, the success rate was a pedestrian .763.\n\nBefore you dismiss the Heat\u2019s feat on Tuesday, consider that free throws are far from gimmes. N.B.A. teams this season are making about 78 of every 100 free throws. But that still leaves 22 that miss.\n\nIn perhaps the worst team performance ever, the Detroit Pistons somehow shot 3 for 17 in a 2017 game (they were also 3 for 23 from 3-point range and lost to the Pelicans by 23).

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFliers stranded by an F.A.A. system failure on Wednesday commended pilots and staff even as passenger advocates called the shutdown \u201cshocking\u201d and potentially avoidable.\n\nFrequent fliers know that feeling well, particularly as air travel has roared back from pandemic lows: Their flight has been delayed, and then they receive little information about when \u2014 or if \u2014 it will take off, stoking feelings of anger and hopelessness. But the Federal Aviation Administration system failure that caused more than 9,000 delays on Wednesday led to a slightly different dynamic for the frustrated passengers: This time, they didn\u2019t have the airline to blame. \u201cBecause it was a systemwide, nationwide thing, there was nowhere to direct your outrage, so everybody was being really helpful,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, a political consultant whose American Airlines flight was delayed in Albany, N.Y. \u201cAnd nobody was yelling at the T.S.A. agents.\u201d The outage that halted takeoffs for about 90 minutes on Wednesday morning was caused by the failure of a system that the F.A.A. uses to send timely safety alerts to pilots. Flights began to resume at around 9 a.m., the F.A.A. said, but the effects continued to snarl air traffic throughout the day.\n\nPaul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, which represents airline consumers, called the shutdown \u201cshocking\u201d and potentially avoidable. \u201cThe fact that this could happen at all shows the real vulnerabilities to the computer system that the F.A.A. operates,\u201d he said. The F.A.A. said it was still investigating the cause of the disruption to the NOTAM \u2014 short for Notice to Air Mission \u2014 alert system. There was no evidence of a cyberattack, said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary. Mr. Hudson said that while the cause of the disruption is still unknown, it is clear that the F.A.A. needs to update its computer system and conduct more \u201cstress tests,\u201d such as drills conducted at airports and by airlines to prepare for emergencies. In terminals across the country, just weeks after mass cancellations by Southwest Airlines left thousands of travelers stranded, many passengers were sanguine about yet another chaotic day for air travel. Bettina Incl\u00e1n, who was traveling to Houston from Washington, said her United pilot kept everyone on her delayed flight informed and calm.\n\n\u201cThe entire United team did really well in setting expectations, being honest on what they knew and didn\u2019t know, and what it all meant,\u201d she said. As Sara Hole, of Stamford, Conn., and her fianc\u00e9, Drew Tomlinson, waited by their gate at Newark Liberty International Airport on Wednesday morning, they got the impression that the American Airlines staff members were just as confused as the passengers. Over the intercom, an airline representative told them there was an F.A.A. \u201csystem outage,\u201d but there were few other details. \u201cThey have emphasized that they have all of the same information that we do,\u201d Ms. Hole said.\n\nSome of the passengers may have been accommodating, but their plans were no less ruined. Ms. McIntosh, who left for the airport at 4:30 a.m. to catch a flight to Raleigh, N.C., for a business meeting, eventually went back home when she realized she was going to miss most of it. Ms. Incl\u00e1n had to rearrange several meetings, and Ms. Hole said she and her fianc\u00e9 would probably miss their connecting flight in Phoenix, disrupting their planned hiking trip in Utah for Mr. Tomlinson\u2019s birthday. Several major airlines, including Delta, American and United, announced that they would waive any fees typically associated with changing flights because of Wednesday\u2019s delays and cancellations. The fact that the disruption came from the F.A.A. and not an airline dealing with overbooked flights may explain why many passengers were not as outraged as they might have been, said Mike Arnot, an industry analyst.\n\n\u201cSafety first, and that\u2019s the right call,\u201d he said. \u201cBy and large, this will be hopefully forgotten by most of the traveling public soon.\u201d Not everyone was so understanding. Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and the ranking member in the Senate aviation committee, called for accountability from the F.A.A. on what went wrong. \u201cThe flying public deserves safety in the sky,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe F.A.A.\u2019s inability to keep an important safety system up and running is completely unacceptable.\u201d Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 workers, said the disruption was a \u201cfrustrating\u201d reminder of the need to update the computer systems that airline crews rely on to operate. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out more about the root cause of the issue in the coming days,\u201d Ms. Nelson said, \u201cbut what\u2019s clear is the need for robust and stable funding this year to bring our aviation system into the 21st century.\u201d Paola Canales, who was flying Spirit Airlines to Honduras with a layover in Florida, said the malfunction made her worry about the integrity of the system. \u201cThink about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHacks happen all the time now.\u201d Sayron Stokes, a passenger headed from La Guardia to Oakland, Calif., on Southwest, said she was \u201cvery mad\u201d about the meltdown as she looked for a quiet corner of the airport for a nap on Wednesday. \u201cWe need to do something better,\u201d she said.\n\nUnlike Southwest\u2019s holiday season meltdown, when passengers aimed their anger squarely at the airline and some of its workers, the disappointment on Wednesday couldn\u2019t be pinned on a specific company or even severe weather. No matter the airline or the region of the country, everyone was in the dark. It led to confusing scenes in the early morning as the picture came into focus. Venus Marcil said she and her uncle were on their plane at Orlando International Airport, seatbelts fastened and their plane cleared for takeoff for their 7:25 a.m. Delta flight to New York, when the pilot said they would not be departing. The passengers deplaned, and she was told she would receive an update in about two hours. But that wasn\u2019t Delta\u2019s fault, she said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been transparent and timely with the communication,\u201d Ms. Marcil said of the airline.

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe ideal of art as a public good has fortified her long career and some 30 commissions around New York.\n\nThe artist Ann Gillen, who has spent her career creating public sculpture, largely within New York City, lives and works in a SoHo loft as close to the romantic conception of a SoHo artist loft as can be imagined. Expansive and drafty, it has remained largely unchanged since 1973, when Gillen met its departing occupant, the painter Norman Lewis, at a party, and arranged to move in. She lives modestly, ceding much of her space to her work: sculptures spread across the well-worn wood floor, demanding you move around them. A small seating area has been colonized by Gillen\u2019s prints and handmade artist books; a commanding aluminum triptych insinuates itself over the dining table. Toward the rear, a hand-built display case is neatly lined with hundreds of maquettes, pocket-size configurations of bent, vibrantly colored sheet metal \u2014 a museum in miniature representing decades of proposals, some realized, many not. Gillen has had successes. She has completed 30 major public, private and corporate commissions: sculptures for Bellevue and Lincoln hospitals; a permanent installation in CUNY\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism; a frieze for the Queens Public Library\u2019s Marathon Parkway branch; for Lincoln Center, \u201cProcessions\u201d (1994-1996), a series of gracefully simplified figures painted in the complex\u2019s underground garages and stairwells up to the Metropolitan Opera House. \u201cFlying Red\u201d (1987), an exultant sculpture of torqued cadmium-painted aluminum, still enlivens the sidewalk outside the Brutalist office tower at 909 Third Avenue.\n\nGillen is a total product of the city. Raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn by an art teacher mother and a lawyer-turned-private-investigator father, she attended the Pratt Institute, as her mother had, where she studied industrial design, and later earned an M.F.A. at Columbia University\u2019s School of the Arts in 1969. By that time, Gillen had already largely developed her aesthetic grammar: a sense of form that moves freely between figuration and abstraction, organic shapes that could seem to vibrate and that communicated the city\u2019s energies, both in its conscious and subconscious effects. One of her earliest works, \u201cLe Weekend Relief\u201d (1969), a 36-by-5 foot Masonite frieze, employs repeating forms of tightly coiled figures. Painted in primary colors, its parts function together as a group, or individually, as an idea that speaks to the nature of city life, its capacity to at once thrust us together and atomize us (a cobalt segment is included in the show).\n\n\u201cToward Civic Art,\u201d co-curated by the artist and independent curator Miles Huston, locates that spirit throughout the arc of Gillen\u2019s career. Her work begins with an understanding of public space as communal, vital to the health of a city. As with most aspects of art making, the nature of public art commissions shifted with the influx of money into the art world; where artists of Gillen\u2019s generation had to advocate for the funding of their work, mega-galleries were now able to pay for their artists\u2019 forays into public sculpture, a development that the city\u2019s arts administrators, of course, welcomed, but one in which concerns like Gillen\u2019s were no longer paramount. \u201cUsually when artists who have gallery practices are given a public commission, they\u2019re scaling something from that practice,\u201d Huston said. \u201cThat\u2019s different to Ann, whose subject was this civic sphere. It wasn\u2019t, \u2018Oh, here\u2019s an atrium, do something with it.\u2019 For Ann, the atrium meant something, or these plazas meant something.\u201d Perhaps as a holdover from her dealings with municipal bodies and selection committees, Gillen speaks in practical terms. Her formal approach is practical, too \u2014 and what can appear abstract is in fact highly logical. Her forms have a clear relationship to Hellenistic art. \u201cI said, all right, the Greeks were right,\u201d Gillen recalled, laughing. \u201cThe purity of three points\u201d \u2014 referring to three-point perspective, a basic drawing principle to give form depth \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s comfort in that.\u201d Her art is also deeply informed by the city\u2019s architecture and verticality, and the way the city bends the flow of people into its own shape. It shares the city\u2019s quality of resisting immediate interpretation, revealing its secrets only with sustained looking. A series of woodblock prints sequentially titled \u201cCrowd\u201d first suggest dissipating tributaries, but can also seem to resolve into the delicately gothic arches of Minoru Yamasaki\u2019s original World Trade Center towers. \u201cI realized years later what I was doing was the facades of buildings, distorted, because I rode my bike all over the city,\u201d Gillen said.\n\nGillen\u2019s work delights in making its construction visible and more beautiful for it: \u201cI had seen all the monuments in Rome, and they had bands of steel all over them \u2014 it\u2019s sort of hilarious and no one talks about it. And it\u2019s glorious. So I thought, That\u2019s it. Why not? For example, the Statue of Liberty. Most people think her two feet are holding her up, but there\u2019s a big internal structure. That\u2019s my art. How we\u2019re held to the earth, how we resist falling.\u201d Gillen is constantly thinking about how a sculpture functions in the public realm. \u201cI\u2019m not confined to a gallery in my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want light that shifts, you want to see how it works with people.\u201d Her humanist belief in the social function of art is a fulfillment of what Noguchi envisioned as a \u201cmaking and ownership of art \u2026 beyond personal possession \u2014 a common and free experience.\u201d (In a neat bit of New York public art harmony, Gillen often employed Structural Display, the same fabricator that Noguchi used, across the street from his home and studio in Long Island City, Queens.)\n\nGillen\u2019s most visible sculpture, \u201cFlying Red,\u201d which weighs a ton but retains the breezy feel of a paper crane, is emblematic of how she creates work that is exacting but not prescriptive, a quality the artist and curator Jenni Crain once referred to as a \u201cconsistent nerve and simultaneous gentleness.\u201d Crain, a fellow Pratt alumnus who died in 2021, championed Gillen\u2019s work, and in 2018 placed her in conversation with other women artists associated with the school, including Louise Bourgeois, Beverly Pepper and Deborah Willis. Gillen encountered twinned resistance in a New York enamored with minimalism or still in thrall to the rigid modernist diktats set by the art critic Clement Greenberg, and in an art world that was outright dismissive of women. \u201cI would get emotional, unfortunately,\u201d Gillen said, \u201cwhich never works. I said, \u2018I thought World War II was to get rid of fascism and here you are telling me that Greenberg has all the answers, which is ridiculous. And why are you obeying?\u2019 \u201d Gillen never relented. \u201cI had those teachers, mostly from the Bauhaus, who said, somehow, you have to do work that\u2019s meaningful to you, and just keep doing it. When I work I try to do what I want to do, what I absolutely must do. What is it that I want to do? That\u2019s the question, still to this day.\u201d",

            "content": "President Biden has said his staff has fully cooperated with the National Archives and the Justice Department.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe revelation is sure to intensify Republican attacks on the president, who has called former President Donald J. Trump irresponsible for hoarding sensitive documents at his estate in Florida.\n\nFollow for the latest on the discovery of the second batch of classified documents from Biden\u2019s vice presidency. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden\u2019s aides have found a new batch of classified documents at a second location associated with Mr. Biden, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. It was the second such disclosure in three days, and it was sure to intensify Republican attacks. Republicans reveled in the new disclosures, accusing Mr. Biden of hypocrisy in calling former President Donald J. Trump irresponsible for hoarding sensitive documents at his private club and residence in Florida. This week, the new Republican chairman of the House oversight committee issued a far-ranging request to the National Archives and Records Administration, which is supposed to receive all highly sensitive materials after an administration leaves office, for documents and correspondence. It is not clear where or when the records were recovered. But Mr. Biden\u2019s aides have scoured various places since November, when his lawyers discovered a handful of classified files, including briefing materials on foreign countries, as they closed a think tank office in Washington. The Justice Department is reviewing the discovery to determine how to proceed.\n\nBy contrast, the first set of documents found by Mr. Biden\u2019s lawyers was voluntarily returned to the archives in November, and had not been logged as missing. It is not clear if the archives had flagged the new materials. A spokesman for the archives declined to comment. The discovery of the second batch raises new questions about the handling of sensitive documents by a Biden team that has prided itself for adhering to norms and rules flouted by his predecessor.

But the circumstances of the two cases appear strikingly different. Unlike Mr. Trump, who resisted returning the records stored at Mar-a-Lago and failed to fully comply with a subpoena, Mr. Biden\u2019s team appears to have acted swiftly and in accordance with the law, immediately summoning officials with the National Archives to retrieve the files. The archives then alerted the Justice Department, according to the White House. \u201cAfter I was briefed about the discovery, I was surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken to that office,\u201d Mr. Biden said in Mexico. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the documents,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, refused to address the issue, saying it would be inappropriate to comment on a matter under review by the Justice Department. She also declined to provide details of searches undertaken by Mr. Biden\u2019s legal team after the first batch of files was discovered and did not respond when asked about the possibility that other sensitive materials dating to the Obama era were stored at other Biden-related locations. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go beyond what the president shared yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go beyond what my colleagues at the White House counsel shared with all of you as well.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, he took another step in keeping with his promise to hold the Biden administration accountable for what Republicans describe as politicizing federal agencies: pressing the Treasury Department for information about Mr. Biden\u2019s family finances. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Biden\u2019s staff have no idea how many classified documents are in Biden\u2019s former offices and are desperately looking for them,\u201d Tommy Pigott, the rapid response director of the Republican National Committee, wrote in an email.",

            "content": "Hace poco tuve una llamada de ocho minutos con mi buena amiga Tina, a quien conozco desde hace m\u00e1s de tres d\u00e9cadas. Parec\u00eda que nunca pod\u00eda contactarla (tiene un trabajo muy exigente) hasta que le envi\u00e9 un mensaje de texto hace unos d\u00edas proponi\u00e9ndole una llamada telef\u00f3nica de ocho minutos. Vamos, le dije. Puedes hacerlo. \u00a1El presidente de Estados Unidos probablemente podr\u00eda darme ocho minutos! Prometo no extenderme mucho. Escoge una hora. A la hora acordada, la llam\u00e9 por tel\u00e9fono. En poco tiempo, hablamos sobre la salud de nuestras madres, hicimos planes de cumplea\u00f1os, chismeamos sobre un amigo que renunci\u00f3 abruptamente a su trabajo y se mud\u00f3 a un peque\u00f1o pueblo mexicano, intercambiamos recomendaciones de libros y exploramos la posibilidad de la vida despu\u00e9s de la muerte (veredicto: no estamos seguras). De manera intensa, conversamos sobre todos los temas antes de que Tina anunciara que nuestros ocho minutos hab\u00edan terminado y, adem\u00e1s, hab\u00eda llegado a la tintorer\u00eda. Colgu\u00e9, sonriendo y tarareando una peque\u00f1a melod\u00eda. La hab\u00eda extra\u00f1ado y no me hab\u00eda dado cuenta hasta que escuch\u00e9 su voz. Tambi\u00e9n me sorprendi\u00f3 la cantidad de temas que cubrimos sin que la llamada se sintiera apresurada. Nuestra conexi\u00f3n fue breve, pero real.\n\nD\u00eda 2 del Reto de la felicidad: prueba hacer una llamada telef\u00f3nica de ocho minutos Hoy tu objetivo ser\u00e1 pensar en una persona que amas: alguien a quien extra\u00f1as, alguien con quien deseas conectarte m\u00e1s a menudo. Env\u00edale a esa persona un mensaje de texto r\u00e1pido (o un WhatsApp) pregunt\u00e1ndole si puede hablar por tel\u00e9fono durante solo ocho minutos, lo ideal es que sea hoy, pero si no, progr\u00e1malo para esta semana. Incluso puedes copiar y pegar este p\u00e1rrafo: \u00a1Hola! Le\u00ed esto en The New York Times y me hizo pensar en ti. \u00bfQuieres que tengamos una llamada telef\u00f3nica de ocho minutos esta semana? Despu\u00e9s de que hayan transcurrido los ocho minutos, decidan juntos cu\u00e1ndo ser\u00e1 su pr\u00f3ximo contacto, y luego respeten su compromiso de tiempo y desp\u00eddanse de inmediato. (A menos que tu amigo tenga alg\u00fan tipo de crisis, en cuyo caso es bueno estar en contacto de todos modos). Cuelga y disfruta de ese peque\u00f1o brillo de bienestar. Bob Waldinger, profesor de psiquiatr\u00eda en la Escuela de Medicina de Harvard y autor del libro de reciente publicaci\u00f3n The Good Life: Lessons From the World\u2019s Longest Scientific Study of Happiness, dijo que la mayor\u00eda de las personas ocupadas \u201ctienden a pensar que en un futuro nebuloso tendremos un \u2018excedente de tiempo\u2019 para hablar con los viejos amigos\u201d. Es posible que eso nunca suceda, as\u00ed que usa el tel\u00e9fono y el tiempo ahora mismo, afirma Waldinger. El valor de escuchar la voz de alguien Escuchar el sonido de la voz de un ser querido, dijo Claudia Glaser-Mussen, psicoterapeuta en la ciudad de Nueva York, \u201cte regula emocionalmente\u201d.\n\nEn ocho minutos, agreg\u00f3, \u201cpuedo llamar a mi amiga Mary Beth de la escuela secundaria y decirle: \u2018Te quiero mucho, esto es lo que est\u00e1 pasando\u2019 o \u2018Escucha, quiero contarte algo muy r\u00e1pido\u2019. Es un corto per\u00edodo de tiempo, pero puedes decir mucho, y hay tanta confianza como para que todas las hormonas del v\u00ednculo comiencen a moverse\u201d. Una conclusi\u00f3n r\u00e1pida, acordada de antemano, resuelve un problema de conversaci\u00f3n com\u00fan que fue revelado en un estudio de 2021. Los investigadores analizaron 932 conversaciones entre parejas de personas y descubrieron que casi nunca terminaban cuando ambas quer\u00edan. Algunas prefer\u00edan continuar, mientras que otras sintieron que la interacci\u00f3n se alarg\u00f3 demasiado. Cuando una persona termina la conversaci\u00f3n demasiado pronto, escribieron los investigadores, o conversa sin prestar atenci\u00f3n a las se\u00f1ales est\u00e1ndar de conclusi\u00f3n (como el uso de la palabra \u201cen fin\u201d), el resultado es lo que se conoce como un \u201cproblema de coordinaci\u00f3n\u201d. Una conversaci\u00f3n con un l\u00edmite claro de ocho minutos evita que suceda eso. Un estudio de 240 adultos realizado en 2021 revel\u00f3 que cuando los participantes recibieron breves llamadas telef\u00f3nicas varias veces a la semana, sus niveles de depresi\u00f3n, soledad y ansiedad se \u201credujeron r\u00e1pidamente\u201d en comparaci\u00f3n con las personas que no recibieron una llamada. Como escribe Waldinger en su libro, \u201calgunos ajustes en nuestras relaciones m\u00e1s preciadas pueden tener efectos reales en c\u00f3mo nos sentimos y en c\u00f3mo nos sentimos con respecto a nuestras vidas: se trata de una mina de oro de vitalidad a la que no le estamos prestando atenci\u00f3n\u201d.

De los archivos de la amistad: Rick y David En cada jornada del Reto de la felicidad en siete d\u00edas, de la secci\u00f3n Well, compartiremos historias de amistades significativas, recopiladas de los testimonios enviados por lectores de todo EE. UU.\n\nRick Knapp, de 73 a\u00f1os, conoci\u00f3 a su mejor amigo, David, durante su \u00faltimo a\u00f1o de secundaria en Maryland, y una tragedia compartida los uni\u00f3. Cuando hablaban sobre sus respectivas familias, se enteraron de que sus madres se hab\u00edan suicidado unos a\u00f1os antes. \u201cQu\u00e9 asombrosa \u2014tr\u00e1gica, pero asombrosa\u2014 coincidencia, especialmente en ese momento cuando hab\u00eda un gran estigma en torno al suicidio y los problemas de salud mental\u201d, dijo Rick. \u201cNadie hablaba de eso. Nuestros padres ni siquiera usaban la palabra \u2018suicidio\u2019\u201d. Durante cinco d\u00e9cadas, ambos hombres se han permitido mostrarse vulnerables sobre esas p\u00e9rdidas, y han actuado como terapeutas mutuos cuando no ten\u00edan acceso a un especialista. Seg\u00fan Rick, David tiende a ser m\u00e1s expresivo y emocional y eso lo ha ayudado a abrirse. Estos amigos rara vez han vivido en el mismo estado, pero se han comprometido a mantenerse en contacto. Cuando Rick serv\u00eda en la Fuerza A\u00e9rea y estaba apostado en Europa, los amigos se mandaban cintas de audio de un lado a otro, porque no pod\u00edan pagar las llamadas internacionales. Han intercambiado cartas y ensayos, y finalmente colaboraron en un libro sobre su amistad. Ambos aman la fotograf\u00eda y hacen viajes anuales con otros dos amigos para tomar fotograf\u00edas, relajarse y conectarse. \u201cPerder a mi madre fue una experiencia profundamente personal\u201d, dijo Rick. \u201cMi primera inclinaci\u00f3n fue retraerme. Sent\u00ed como si estuviera en una niebla durante varios a\u00f1os\u201d. Conocer a David cambi\u00f3 eso. \u201cEs como cuando levantas la v\u00e1lvula en la parte superior de una olla a presi\u00f3n\u201d, dijo. \u201cDe repente, el aire puede salir\u201d.",

            "section": "U.S.",
            "content": "Karon Blake, 13, was shot and killed in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, D.C., early Saturday by an armed man who went outside with a firearm after he heard noises, the police said.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nKaron Blake, 13, was killed early Saturday after a man armed with a gun went to investigate someone \u201ctampering\u201d with cars, the police said.\n\nJust before 4 a.m. last Saturday, a man emerged from a residence in Washington, D.C., when he heard noises and saw someone who appeared to be \u201ctampering\u201d with cars, the Metropolitan Police Department said. After an \u201cinteraction,\u201d the police said, the man fatally shot a 13-year-old named Karon Blake. While little has been said about what happened during the encounter between the man and the middle school student, the case has renewed concerns about armed citizens taking matters into their own hands as self-appointed enforcers of the law. And questions have been raised as to why the man has not been publicly identified or arrested. City Council members have spoken out. Officials at Brookland Middle School, where Karon was in the sixth grade, offered condolences and mental health services to his fellow students. The police said they were investigating and working with the U.S. attorney\u2019s office to review the case for potential charges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible situation and we have a 13-year-old that died and we don\u2019t have all of the facts,\u201d Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said at a news conference on Wednesday when she was asked about the level of anger in the community. \u201cAnd the people who are responsible for gathering the facts and making charging decisions are doing it just as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier news conference, on Tuesday, Chief Robert J. Contee III of the Metropolitan Police Department said that the case represented the \u201ctragic death of a son of our city,\u201d but emphasized that the department could not release details about what happened until an investigation was completed. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t allow this matter to divide our community,\u201d Chief Contee said. \u201cWe have people demonizing both sides and we don\u2019t even know all of the facts.\u201d Misinformation about the shooting, including images of \u201cpeople that have no connection to this case,\u201d has circulated widely on social media, the chief said, as have suggestions that race played a role. \u201cThere has been too much misinformation swirling around this incident,\u201d he said. It was not immediately clear what type of gun was used. Chief Contee said that no weapon had been recovered. He described the adult involved as an African American man who has a license to carry a concealed weapon and owns a registered firearm. At the news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Bowser confirmed that the man is a D.C. government employee and said that he had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe man called the police after the shooting and was performing CPR when officers arrived at the scene, Chief Contee said. The man then gave the officers a brief account of what had happened, the chief said. Investigators are examining surveillance video. If there was criminal intent and a crime occurred, a grand jury of D.C. residents would examine the case, the chief said. The chief declined to answer questions about where on his body Karon was shot and how many times, and whether the man\u2019s vehicle was among those allegedly being tampered with. A local law says nondeadly force can be used to protect personal property from theft or damage. The police said in a statement on Saturday that officers responded to the shooting on Quincy Street, in the Brookland neighborhood of Northeast Washington, at 3:56 a.m. The man \u201cheard noises and observed someone that appeared to be tampering with vehicles,\u201d the statement said, adding that he \u201cwent outside, armed with a registered firearm, to further investigate.\u201d \u201cThere was an interaction between a juvenile male and the male resident,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDuring the interaction, the male resident discharged his firearm striking the victim.\u201d Karon was taken to a hospital, where he died from his wounds, the statement said. Community leaders and activists have raised concerns in the days since the shooting. A D.C. Council member, Christina Henderson, said she was working to ensure the public school system had mental health support. \u201cProperty is not greater than life,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cKaron should be alive today.\u201d Zachary Parker, a D.C. Council member who represents the neighborhood where Karon lived, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that he had \u201cdeep concerns about neighbors taking justice into their own hands.\u201d He met with hundreds of community members on Tuesday about their concerns and requested the release of video related to the case.",

            "description": "How Jan. 8 confirmed two tendencies of contemporary populism.",
            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "For two years we have debated whether the essential feature of the Jan. 6 riot, the mob stirred up to storm the Capitol in frustration over the 2020 election, was the ambition in the background or the futility and unreality up front. The ambition, which belonged to Donald Trump and his shrunken inner circle, aimed to provoke a constitutional crisis, which was supposed to begin with Mike Pence\u2019s intervention and culminate, somehow, with the House of Representatives voting Trump into a second term. The futility belonged to the rioters, whose violence and vandalism was an expression of dreampolitik rather than a coup \u2014 its plan for success nonexistent, its end in mass arrests and imprisonment foreordained. And the challenge of analyzing Jan. 6 is that these elements existed together, in an unstable mixture that could theoretically inspire all kinds of imitations \u2014 some empty and grifting and fantastical, some destabilizing and deadly serious. Now we have the first major international imitation of our Capitol riot \u2014 the riots that took over government buildings in the Brazilian capital last weekend in the name of the defeated populist president Jair Bolsonaro. And whatever you make of the original, so far the imitation falls decisively into the unreal-and-futile category. The rioters wanted Bolsonaro back in office as the Jan. 6 protesters wanted Trump to continue in the White House. They believed that the Brazilian presidential election had been stolen much as Trump\u2019s supporters believed that Joe Biden had stolen the 2020 election. Their rhetoric echoed the language of American Trumpists.\n\nBut their homage to Jan. 6 was just that: an act of pure performance unmoored from the realities of power. The timing was the tell. Instead of attempting to halt the work of government or disrupt a transfer of power, the Brazilian rioters stormed into Bras\u00edlia Three Powers Square at a time when its crucial buildings \u2014 the Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace \u2014 were largely empty. The Congress wasn\u2019t in session, the already-invested President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was away touring flood damage; Bolsonaro himself was hanging out in Florida, not hovering nearby. There was no handover of power to forestall, no government to seize, no leader to restore. The only reason to mount such a protest now, it seemed, was the date: Jan. 8 is close enough to Jan. 6 to provide the necessary imitative frisson. Even writers who make it their business to be alarmed by the perils of populism seemed a bit baffled by all this. \u201cToday\u2019s riot makes more sense if the point was to create a visual echo of what happened in Washington,\u201d wrote Anne Applebaum of The Atlantic, as opposed to actually blocking Lula \u201cfrom exercising power.\u201d In the same publication, Yascha Mounk called the scene \u201csurreal,\u201d featuring rioters who \u201cseemed almost to be cosplaying American insurrectionists.\u201d And since the Jan. 6 experience was itself thick with forms of cosplay \u2014 the QAnon Shaman and the people snapping selfies were engaged in a lark, not a serious political intervention \u2014 the Brazilian imitation felt even more distant from reality, a LARP (live action role play) of a LARP. Since Bolsonaro, like Trump, really was elected president, you can\u2019t dismiss all of his populism as simple unreality, any more than you can dismiss the violence that accompanied both of the January protests. (Though the rising violence in Peru, which has been roiled by protests on behalf of a left-wing president who was forced out after attempting to rule by decree, probably deserves more attention than the Brazilian riots at the moment.)\n\nBut you can look at Brazil\u2019s Jan. 8 and see two tendencies of contemporary populism confirmed. First is the way that today\u2019s populist movements and politicians tend to alienate and alarm the stakeholder groups whose support they would need for any true regime change or revolution. This was clearly true on Jan. 6 in the United States, where every major institution was against the Trumpists, leading to populist philippics against not only the news media and the courts but also the F.B.I. and the military. Yet even in Brazil, with a history of military rule and an armed forces clearly favorable to Bolsonaro\u2019s populism, the movement to overturn Lula\u2019s election has ended up isolated and impotent. Second, in Bras\u00edlia as in America, you can see the reliable tendency of today\u2019s populists to \u200cseek the showy confrontation, the grand and futile act of protest, over the grinding work of politics and policy. This is a quality they have in common with right-wing radicals (and other radicals) of the past. But cable news and the internet have magnified the opportunities for unreal gestures, pure performativity, fan bases built on an unremitting series of glorious defeats. It doesn\u2019t matter if the revolution is ever real; so long as it's on television, that\u2019s enough. For populism\u2019s enemies, center-left and liberal, this combination of attributes has saved them more than once from the consequences of their own hubris or mistakes. Blunder as our elite institutions might, the populist rebels and their avatars are usually ready with a greater fecklessness, a stumblebum anti-politics, a toxic mix of the authoritarian and the incompetent \u2014 and then, as in the new Republican House of Representatives or Liz Truss\u2019s ill-fated Tory government, a cycling back to the unpopular agendas that provoked populist rebellion in the first place. This leaves those who can\u2019t rally to liberalism, who are stuck for one reason or another on the right (or on the left-wing fringe), with two main options. They can look hopefully in the chaos for hints of a more constructive populism \u2014 the sort that exists in theory but not in Trumpian or Bolsonaran practice, the sort that various intellectuals spent the Trump era trying to import into his movement, the sort of new right or even newer left-right fusion that\u2019s always just around the corner. Alternatively, they can try to look beyond populism entirely, treating it as a failed experiment, as fundamentally unreal in both its plans and its effects as Jan. 8\u2019s bizarre Latin American imitation of America\u2019s Jan. 6.

One is a home-heating serviceman in central England; the other is an Uber driver in the French Riviera.",
            "section": "U.S.",
            "content": "From 2004 to 2008, three men who were held as detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay won Supreme Court cases that came to shape the military\u2019s authority to detain men at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba. Prisoners there now have access to lawyers, a right denied them for nearly three years. They have the right to challenge their detention in federal court. And the Supreme Court found that the first war crimes tribunals set up by George W. Bush were unconstitutional. Today, the three men whose names are on those cases are free and have been reunited with their families.\n\nIn the frantic aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, hundreds of men captured abroad were sent to the U.S. military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, where they were held without access to lawyers and denied all other rights. In time, the cases of three of the prisoners reached the Supreme Court and made history. Their challenges changed the legal landscape at Guant\u00e1namo and stripped the military and the White House of unchecked authority to detain people there. We caught up with two of the men, one in a gray industrial town in central England where he grew up, the other a thousand miles away in the sun-splashed Riviera in France. The third is struggling in war-torn Yemen. All three of the former prisoners were reunited with their families years ago and managed to build new lives despite the abuse they endured and the stigma of having been held at Guant\u00e1namo. \u200c\u200c\n\nToday, Mr. Rasul, 45, lives with his wife, their two children and his widowed mother in the same rowhouse along Victoria Road in Tipton, England, where he was raised. Two of his brothers live with their families in adjoining houses in the former factory town of brick buildings and bygone canals. A soft-spoken man, Mr. Rasul describes himself as a homebody who earns a living by servicing natural gas home heating systems for a locally based national firm. \u201cI just keep to myself and busy all the time,\u201d he said. His employers know he was held by the U.S. military, he said, and sometimes he thinks people recognize him as one of three Muslims from Tipton who were held at Guant\u00e1namo for two years without being charged. But no one discusses it anymore.\n\nThey were returned to England nearly three years later, and Mr. Rasul became one of the first former prisoners to campaign against the wartime prison. Interest in his story took him far from home \u2014 to Berlin, Japan and back to Pakistan in 2005 to film a portion of the movie. While he was there, he met his future wife, Kafia. Theirs was an arranged marriage. Finding a wife in England was hard. \u201cWhen they heard you were in Guant\u00e1namo \u2026\u201d Mr. Rasul said, his voice trailing off. They have two children, a daughter, Khadijah, 13, and a son, Zayd, 12, who view their father\u2019s time in U.S. custody as something fleeting and mostly forgotten. It was only after their father dug out some letters he wrote to his mother from detention that they realized he had been held for years, and not the days that they had come to imagine.\n\nBy then, lawyers for the British prisoners were compiling accounts of their abuse for a lawsuit against senior U.S. military leaders. U.S. courts rejected the civil suit. But the British government paid out a multimillion-dollar settlement to 16 Guant\u00e1namo prisoners, including Mr. Rasul, who blamed British intelligence agents for some of their mistreatment. Two years after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mr. Rasul, it dealt the Bush administration another blow in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan v. Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was then the secretary of defense. Mr. Hamdan was charged with war crimes for serving as Osama bin Laden\u2019s driver and bodyguard in Afghanistan. But in June 2006, the court struck down as unconstitutional the military tribunal that was created at Guant\u00e1namo to try Mr. Hamdan. The Bush administration crafted a new court, this time with the approval of Congress, and in 2008 a panel of U.S. military officers convicted Mr. Hamdan. But he was sentenced to a short term and, with time served, he was back in his native Yemen before Mr. Bush, whose administration he had challenged, left office. A higher court overturned that conviction in 2012.\n\nIn the years since Lakhdar Boumediene won his freedom, he has struggled to start over. He has done factory work and by his own account was nearly defeated trying to navigate France\u2019s social welfare system to obtain respiratory care for his sickly newborn son. He has co-written a memoir and become a grandfather. Today, Mr. Boumediene, 56, is an Uber driver on the French Riviera, shuttling tourists along the Mediterranean between Nice, Saint-Tropez and Monaco in a hybrid Peugeot sedan purchased with donations from people who heard his story. On a good day, he is home by late afternoon with fruit from the market and a few euros for the Disney character banks of his youngest daughters, ages 8 and 10. His son, Yousef, is now a healthy 12-year-old soccer enthusiast. Two older daughters born before Guant\u00e1namo both have children, and sometimes the entire family crams into his four-room, state-supported apartment in Carros, a hillside village north of Nice.\n\nMr. Boumediene, an Algerian, said he never trained with or joined Al Qaeda. Allegations that he was involved in a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, proved unfounded. The Islamic Red Crescent had sent him there with his family to administer a charity for orphans, \u201cover a thousand miles away from the battlefield in Afghanistan,\u201d the U.S. judge who ordered his release noted. Yet Bosnian authorities handed him and five others over to the U.S. military in 2002 for what became an odyssey of humiliation, hunger strikes and abuse. \u201cI lost seven and a half years,\u201d he said on a weekday afternoon in winter, the Riviera\u2019s slow season, as his youngest daughters spilled into the sitting room after school for hugs and kisses. On this day, six of his children and grandchildren, who range in age from a toddler to a 27-year-old, supervised the little ones or played on the fringes of an interview with Mr. Boumediene and his wife, Abassia Bouadjmi, who stood by him throughout his time in prison. \u201cI would travel across the ocean for my husband,\u201d she said of the distance Guant\u00e1namo put between them. When her husband was taken away, she and the girls returned to family in Algeria. Then, under a resettlement agreement between the Obama administration and the French government, they were reunited in Paris. Mr. Boumediene was first taken to a military hospital to strengthen his frail body while his wife and his oldest daughters, Raja and Rahma, waited for him to be well enough to travel to the south of France, where his sister-in-law lived.\n\nHe spoke about his time at Guant\u00e1namo with a mix of bewilderment and indignation. He said his guards were trained to believe he was a terrorist and expressed interest in just three things \u2014 food, sports and sex. He began a hunger strike, he said, after seeing a guard siphoning off food rations intended for the prisoners. For about two years, Mr. Boumediene refused to consume anything but a nutritional supplement, which at times was fed to him through a tube snaked up his nose and into his stomach, a common practice at the time at Guant\u00e1namo. He was direct about what he thinks should happen now. He wants a letter of apology from the United States \u2014 and reparations. On one level, he said, the landmark 2008 case Boumediene v. Bush means a federal judge can independently evaluate the U.S. military\u2019s basis for holding an enemy combatant at Guant\u00e1namo. \u201cBut me, I am a person who represents this principle,\u201d he said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nNurses have remained on the picket lines this week at Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center, which have been less full but still tumultuous as they operate with skeletal staffs.\n\nAmbulances have been diverted, elective procedures canceled and as many patients as possible have been discharged as Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx grapples with a nurses\u2019 strike that stretched into its third day on Wednesday. With 3,500 nurses off the job, the hospital has called in temporary nurses, and the mayor asked people to dial 911 only when necessary. The emergency room waiting area has been largely quiet. But conditions deeper inside one of the borough\u2019s main hospitals \u2014 and in another of the city\u2019s major hospitals, Mount Sinai in Manhattan, where another 3,600 nurses are on strike \u2014 are even more tumultuous than usual, patients and staff members said, as a crew of temporary and redeployed workers tried to care for people in the nurses\u2019 absence.\n\nOn the picket line in New York City\u2019s largest nurse strike in decades, nurses said they were worried about conditions inside. But they were outside the buildings for now, they said, because they wanted to improve care so they could keep patients safer in the longer term. At Montefiore, a vital safety-net hospital in the northeast Bronx, nurses said one of the main reasons they were striking was that tumultuous was too often the norm. Ana Villeda, an emergency room nurse, said her work environment often resembled a New York City parking garage, with rolling stretchers stacked several deep. In order to reach patients, nurses have to pull down the rails of the stretchers to squeeze between them.\n\u2022 None Apple: After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company will conduct an audit of its U.S. labor practices under an agreement with investors.\n\u2022 None N.Y.C. Nurses\u2019 Strike: Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan ended a three-day strike after the hospitals agreed to add staffing and improve working conditions.\n\u2022 None Amazon: A federal labor official A federal labor official rejected the company\u2019s attempt to overturn a union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island, removing a key obstacle to contract negotiations between the union and the company.\n\u2022 None Electric Vehicles: In a milestone for the sector, In a milestone for the sector, employees at an E.V. battery plant in Ohio voted to join the United Automobile Workers union, citing pay and safety issues as key reasons. Because of a shortage of poles for intravenous fluid bags, nurses sometimes have to hang the bags from the walls and curtains. One nurse can have as many as 15 patients, and even more when covering for a colleague who is on break. \u201cYou pile the patients in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a psychiatric patient screaming while you are intubating a patient, right next to each other. It\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d Last week, she said, one man with abdominal pain had waited in a chair for three hours before staff members realized he was having a heart attack. \u201cYou do the best you can,\u201d she said.\n\nNurses, both at Montefiore in the Bronx and at Mount Sinai in Manhattan, said they were hoping that they could alleviate chronic understaffing by negotiating contracts that mandate that managers adhere to minimum staffing levels. This is the first contract being negotiated since before the pandemic began, and understaffing, long an issue, has grown as a problem as hospitals have failed to replace nurses who have left, either to pursue higher-paying jobs or because of trauma and burnout after several Covid waves. Both Mount Sinai and Montefiore have hundreds of open nursing positions, which managers blame on the national nursing shortage but which the union believes could be filled by increasing pay and improving working conditions. \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d the nurses chanted outside Montefiore on Tuesday. \u201cSafe staffing!\u201d At Montefiore, nurses and managers returned to the bargaining table for continued talks on Wednesday. At Mount Sinai\u2019s main campus on Fifth Avenue, talks had been stalled since early Monday, with each side blaming the other for the inaction. Negotiations also resumed there on Wednesday, Mount Sinai said. Both hospitals said that they were open for business and that patient safety remained their top priority. An outpatient center across from Montefiore\u2019s main campus was busy on Tuesday, and patients continued to trickle into both the pediatric and adult emergency rooms. \u201cContingency plans remain in place to ensure our hospitals remain open,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. Lucia Lee, a spokeswoman for Mount Sinai, acknowledged that the situation was \u201cimpossible\u201d but said the hospital was coping, thanks to the support of the staff members who were still at work. \u201cWe are weathering through it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are trying to be resilient.\u201d The main campus of Mount Sinai is down to about 525 patients, from its typical 1,100, as patients are transferred to Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai Morningside, where union agreements have already been reached, she said. \u201cThis is a strike crisis, and we are responding to it,\u201d she said.\n\nOne nurse manager at Mount Sinai, who asked that her name be withheld to protect her job, described conditions over the past two days that she felt had been dangerous for patients. She said that managers had been told that more temporary travel nurses would be hired to help cover for the striking nurses but that many of them apparently did not show up and that the working conditions for those filling in were not sustainable. Across the hospital, nursing managers have been pressed into service as floor nurses, even those who have not dealt directly with patients for a long time, she said. Some don\u2019t know how to use all the equipment, so they are leaning heavily on the travel nurses who are there, she said, and the travel nurses are not familiar with all of the equipment, either. Both hospitals originated from 19th-century Jewish philanthropic efforts, and both have undertaken breakneck expansion efforts over the past decade. But they are very different institutions. Facing Central Park, Mount Sinai draws many patients from both East Harlem and the Upper East Side, but also from elsewhere in the city. More patients have commercial insurance, rather than government-sponsored Medicaid, which means that the hospital is paid better for each patient than hospitals in other boroughs, where more patients tend to have lower-reimbursing Medicaid. A decade ago, Mount Sinai merged with another network of hospitals that included Beth Israel and the two campuses of St. Luke\u2019s Roosevelt, emerging as one of the largest hospital systems in the city. The strike affects only the main Mount Sinai campus. Montefiore, the largest hospital system in the Bronx, has tried to emphasize that its financial position is very different from those of other hospitals negotiating with the nurses\u2019 union. There are strikes at three campuses, including the Moses campus, its main site. Medicaid patients outnumber those with commercial insurance by two to one. In a statement last week, a Montefiore vice president, Joe Solmonese, noted that the system had lost $200 million last year, while some of the major hospital systems negotiating with the nurses\u2019 union were running at a profit. But Montefiore has also expanded over the last decade, acquiring several hospitals in Westchester County and the lower Hudson Valley. More recently, job postings at Montefiore have indicated that it is planning to open \u201ca concierge/executive medicine\u201d service, based at Hudson Yards, a pricey neighborhood on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, in search of more patients with commercial insurance.\n\nAfter contracts between the New York State Nursing Association and about a dozen private hospitals in the city expired on Dec. 31, eight hospitals have come to tentative agreements or ratified them. All of the hospitals have agreed to wage increases that total about 19 percent over three years, an offer also on the table at Montefiore and Mount Sinai. But there remain sticking points. At Montefiore, nurses want the management to address the problem of overcrowding in the emergency department and the practice of boarding patients in hallways for long stretches, said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse on the negotiating committee. They also are asking for hiring bonuses to attract new nurses and better enforcement of patient-nurse ratios. \u201cWe want to be with our patients,\u201d said Michelle Gonzalez, a Montefiore nurse. \u201cWe want be taking care of our community, but give us the resources that we need to do that.\u201d At Mount Sinai, nurses are asking for nurse-to-patient ratios that have an enforcement mechanism so they cannot be ignored. Currently, nurses may file a protest letter when they are asked to care for more patients than in the last union contract. The management then signs the letter. This happens so frequently that the letters are sometimes referred to as \u201cwallpaper,\u201d the nursing manager said. To deal with the nursing strike, Mount Sinai transferred fragile premature infants out of the newborn intensive care unit. Doctors and physician assistants are pitching in. Some said that for now, staff members appeared to be managing to care for the patients, but not easily. Olivia Early, who trains hospital workers to operate electronic medical records software, said on Tuesday that the scene inside Mount Sinai the day before had been \u201cchaotic,\u201d as patients received care from a visibly stretched staff that included fill-ins from other Mount Sinai sites and doctors thrust into \u201cnurse-like roles.\u201d But despite the scramble, Ms. Early said she had seen no lapses in patient care in the wing where she was working on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s none yet, thank God,\u201d she said.",

            "content": "The attack happened as holiday revelry neared its peak on the last day of the year.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTrevor Bickford was already facing state charges stemming from an assault on three New York City officers near Times Square.\n\nFederal prosecutors filed charges on Tuesday against a 19-year-old Maine man whom the authorities have portrayed as carrying out a \u201cjihad-inspired\u201d terrorist attack on three New York City police officers near Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve. State prosecutors said last week that the man, Trevor Bickford, had told investigators after he was arrested in the attack on the officers that he had come to New York to \u201ckill people and carry out jihad.\u201d On Tuesday, federal prosecutors said that Mr. Bickford had planned the assault and that investigators had interviewed him weeks before it occurred. In announcing the charges, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Mr. Bickford had targeted the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in \u201ca brazen act of violence and hatred in the name of jihad.\u201d Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, called the assault on the officers \u201ca jihad-inspired attack.\u201d Mr. Bickford, who was previously charged by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office with first-degree attempted murder, attempted assault and state terrorism counts, now faces four federal counts of attempted murder.\n\nThe attack occurred just after 10 p.m. on Dec. 31 at 52nd Street and Eighth Avenue, where a group of officers were stationed as the annual revelry neared its peak. Approaching the officers, Mr. Bickford said, \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 Arabic for \u201cGod is great\u201d \u2014 before hitting one over the head with a long knife known as a kukri, according to court documents. The blow fractured the officer\u2019s skull, the police said. Mr. Bickford then charged at another officer, dropping the knife as he did and trying to grab the officer\u2019s gun, according to court documents. The police said a third officer shot Mr. Bickford in the shoulder before he was taken into custody, where he remains. The F.B.I. began to investigate Mr. Bickford in mid-December, in part based on concerns raised by members of his family about his behavior, according to a criminal complaint filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The family members said he had recently converted to Islam, had begun to visit mosques in and around Maine and New Hampshire, had started to research the Taliban and had shown interest in traveling to Afghanistan to join the group, according to the complaint.\n\nHe also bought a crossbow that he planned to take with him and felt obligated by the Islamic religion to practice using the weapon every day, the complaint says. Late last year, the complaint says, Mr. Bickford told family members that he wanted to travel to Jordan or Afghanistan to become a suicide bomber for his religion. He bought a ticket to Jordan but did not board the flight, according to the complaint. In mid-December, after scrapping the Jordan trip, Mr. Bickford agreed to be interviewed by the F.B.I., according to the complaint. He said in the interview that he had begun to read the Quran and attend mosques and had started to follow imams on YouTube, the complaint says. He also said he had bought tickets several weeks earlier to fly to India and had planned to travel from there to Afghanistan, the complaint says. Once in Afghanistan, he told the F.B.I., he hoped to \u201cally\u201d himself with the Taliban and to persuade them to help him fight the oppression of Muslims in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, the complaint says. Mr. Bickford canceled the Afghanistan trip in order to see his brother, a U.S. soldier who was coming to visit him, according to the complaint.\n\nMr. Bickford claimed in the interview that he did not agree with the Taliban\u2019s use of violence against civilians and that he did not intend to join Al Qaeda, the complaint says. Trevor Bickford used this knife to attack three police officers, the authorities say. The federal defenders office, which is representing Mr. Bickford in the federal case, declined to comment Tuesday night. The Legal Aid Society, which represented him in state court, said last week that he had no criminal record and cautioned against a rush to judge him. An aunt of Mr. Bickford\u2019s told The New York Times last week that she does not believe he is a terrorist. \u201cI want that label off of him,\u201d the aunt, Muriella D\u2019Antilio, said in an interview. Instead, she said, he was depressed and had struggled because of a turbulent home life that included his father\u2019s overdose death in 2018. On the day of the attack, prosecutors said, Mr. Bickford wrote in his journal that \u201cthis will likely be my last entry\u201d and that he believed his brother, the soldier, had \u201cjoined the ranks of my enemy.\u201d In an interview with investigators after the attack, Mr. Bickford said he had recited verses from the Quran in his head to \u201chype himself up\u201d for his assault. He said he believed he had failed because he did not kill any officers and had not died himself, the complaint says.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAllies of President Vladimir V. Putin contradicted each other about battlefield progress, as a war command shake-up put another Kremlin loyalist in charge.\n\nRussia has replaced the general in charge of its trouble-plagued war against Ukraine, amid signs of dissension among President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s top allies \u2014 a shake-up that critics said would not address what ails the Russian military. Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, whose appointment the Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday, is a longtime Kremlin ally, chief of the military general staff since 2012, and an executor of the failed plan for the initial invasion in February. It was the second time in just three months that the ministry replaced the chief of the war effort. Outside analysts and hawkish Russian war bloggers said the change was a far cry from the radical overhaul the Russian armed forces need to become more effective. \u201cThe sum does not change, just by changing the places of its parts,\u201d wrote one prominent blogger who goes by the name Rybar.\n\nThe reshuffling of commanders came as the Kremlin sharply contradicted a key Putin ally about the pitched combat for Soledar, a small town in eastern Ukraine. On Tuesday, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary force, said that his troops had seized control of Soledar, posted online a photo of himself with some of the soldiers in what he said was the town\u2019s famous salt mine, and made a point of claiming that only Wagner fighters had been battling there on behalf of Russia.\n\nBut both the Russian Defense Ministry and Ukrainian commanders contradicted those claims on Wednesday, saying that combat continued in Soledar and that the town had not yet fallen. The Russian ministry also said its own troops were fighting there. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, urged journalists to wait for official announcements about whether the city had been captured, adding that \u201ctactical successes are certainly very important as they come at a rather expensive price.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have taken someone who is competent and replaced him with someone who is incompetent, but who has been there a long time and who has shown that he is loyal,\u201d said Dara Massicot, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation in Washington. \u201cWhatever is happening in Moscow, it is out of touch with what is happening on the ground in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn an intelligence assessment, the British Defense Ministry said the switch was \u201ca clear acknowledgment that the campaign is falling short of Russia\u2019s strategic goals.\u201d But it said the move would meet with \u201cextreme displeasure\u201d among pro-war ultranationalists \u201cwho have increasingly blamed Gerasimov for the poor execution of the war.\u201d Russian setbacks slowed under General Surovikin, but did not stop. Ukrainian forces, armed with increasingly sophisticated Western weapons, made more gains in Kherson Province and in the Donbas region in the east, and repeatedly struck targets far behind the front lines. A monthslong Russian drive to capture the small city of Bakhmut, in the Donbas, has cost many lives but gained little ground.\n\nA concerted effort to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy systems has failed to bombard the country into submission, while leaving Russia short of precision munitions. And after Mr. Putin ordered the draft of 300,000 additional troops, new conscripts reported being thrown into the fight with minimal training and inadequate equipment. Some were killed after just days in uniform. The most striking recent failure came on New Year\u2019s Day, when Ukrainian artillery struck a complex housing new Russian soldiers in the Donbas city of Makiivka. The Defense Ministry acknowledged that 89 were killed, but Ukraine claimed casualties in the hundreds. The hawkish Russian military bloggers \u2014 a major source of information on the war in a country where the Kremlin controls the media \u2014 blamed Russian commanders: They had concentrated the troops rather than spreading them out, had housed them next to an ammunition depot, and had not prevented soldiers from using cellphones, whose signals the Ukrainians apparently used to zero in on their location.\n\nThe criticism leveled at uniformed Russian commanders has created an opportunity for Mr. Prigozhin to portray himself and Wagner as indispensable to the war effort. He seems to be trying to raise his political profile within Russia, though to what end is unclear. Abbas Gallyamov, a former speechwriter for Mr. Putin who has broken ties with the president, said that Mr. Prigozhin was angling to replace Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, a longtime Putin confidant. Wagner has become a kind of shadow army for Russia, deployed in support of the Kremlin\u2019s military campaigns in Africa and the Middle East.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAlso, Brazil investigates the riots and Australia reacts to Cardinal George Pell\u2019s death.\n\nRussia again reshuffled its military command in Ukraine as its forces struggle to make progress in the east. It replaced its top commander with a Kremlin insider who helped to orchestrate the invasion. Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who is being replaced, was appointed just three months ago. His appointment ended months of disjointed military structure and followed a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive that drove the Russians out of much of the Kharkiv region. Under Surovikin, the Russian military largely switched to a defensive mode, allowing it to reduce the military failures that had characterized the first half year of the war. Russia shifted its strategy and began launching missile and drone attacks against Ukraine\u2019s energy grid. But Russian forces have struggled in the continuing offensive for Ukraine\u2019s east. For weeks, the front lines have been largely static. Analysts said that the replacement of Surovikin, a respected commander, with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, a Kremlin apparatchik, showed that President Vladimir Putin remained focused on projecting stability rather than improving Russia\u2019s military outlook. And some nationalist military bloggers compared the reshuffle to a game of musical chairs among Moscow\u2019s ineffectual military old guard.\n\nQuotable: \u201cThey have taken someone who is competent and replaced him with someone who is incompetent, but who has been there a long time and who has shown that he is loyal,\u201d a senior researcher at the RAND Corporation said. Soledar: Ukraine says it is still fighting for this town outside Bakhmut, a key city in the eastern Donbas region, despite the Wagner Group\u2019s claim that its mercenaries had taken the town.\n\nThe news of Cardinal George Pell\u2019s death on Tuesday was met with a divided response in Australia. Some paid tribute to the influential cleric, including Tony Abbott, a former prime minister. But others said their thoughts were with victims of church abuse. Pell, who died in Rome at 81, was once seen as an inspiration in Australia. He rose from Ballarat, a tiny town in Victoria\u2019s highlands, to become the Vatican\u2019s treasurer and the highest-ranking Australian in church history. A historian at Australian Catholic University told the BBC that Pell \u201cput Australia at the center of the Catholic world in a way it never has been before.\u201d\n\nBut in 2017, Pell was recalled from Rome and charged with having abused choir boys in 1996, when he was archbishop of Melbourne. He was convicted in 2018 and imprisoned. In 2020, Australia\u2019s highest court overturned the conviction, saying that there was \u201ca significant possibility\u201d that he was not guilty. And a separate 2017 government inquiry found that Pell had been aware of sexual abuse against children by priests as early as 1974, but failed to act. \u201cNone of us will be shedding any tears,\u201d one man, who was abused in the 1970s, told The Age. The survivor said Pell had \u201cdefended the brand.\u201d Reaction: Some worry that his death could re-traumatize child abuse survivors, The Guardian reports.\n\nThree men who were once held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay won landmark Supreme Court cases that stripped the U.S. military and the White House of unchecked authority to detain people at the naval base. Prisoners now have access to lawyers and can challenge their detention in federal court. And those former prisoners are free. One is a home-heating serviceman in central England; another is an Uber driver in the French Riviera. \u201cI lost seven and a half years,\u201d one man said.\n\nFor her first briefing item of the New Year, our writer Lynsey Chutel gives us a preview of 2023 in Africa. Here\u2019s the view from Johannesburg. Elections that bring change: Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy and most populous country, will elect a new leader on Feb. 25. Muhammadu Buhari, the current president, is completing his second term in office, the constitutional maximum. In the race are a longtime governor, a perennial presidential candidate and a businessman popular with young people. The vote could be a test of whether young Africans can reshape the political landscape. It could inspire change in other African countries holding elections this year, like Zimbabwe. Choppy economic waters: During a global economic downturn, the world\u2019s poorest suffer. In sub-Saharan Africa, slowing economic growth in 2023 could raise poverty levels, the World Bank warned this week. A shrinking global economy will also mean less infrastructure investment, at a time when several countries are already struggling to keep the power on and pay off crippling debt. More reality TV: The genre may be maligned, but on a continent where war and poverty have been the dominant images, it is a welcome alternative. After Nigeria\u2019s \u201cBig Brother Naija\" hit streaming records across Africa during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the latest spinoff is a South African-Nigerian \u201cBig Brother\u201d mega-show, which will begin airing next week. With huge followings and relatively low budgets, reality TV could be a boon to Africa\u2019s television industry.",

So just quickly, thank you Hollywood Foreign Press for giving me this honor. It\u2019s been an amazing journey, an incredible fight to be here today. But I think it\u2019s been worth it.\n\nI remember when I first came to Hollywood, it was a dream come true until I got here because \u2014 look at this face. I came here and was told, \u201cYou\u2019re a minority\u201d and I\u2019m, like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d And then someone said to me [speaking slowly], \u201cYou speak English.\u201d I mean, forget about them not knowing Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Asia, India. And then I said, \u201cYeah, the flight here was about 13 hours long, so I learned.\u201d\n\nAs time went by \u2014 I turned 60 last year. And I think all of you women understand this as the days, the years, and the numbers get bigger, it seems like opportunities start to get smaller as well. And it probably was at a time where I thought, \u201cHey, come on girl, you had a really, really good run, you worked with some of the best people, Steven Spielberg, Jim Cameron and Dan Boyle.\u201d And so it\u2019s good, it\u2019s all good. Then along came the best gift, \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d\n\nShut up, please. [Laughter] I can beat you up. And that\u2019s serious. I thank you A24 for believing in these two goofy, insanely smart, wonderful geniuses, the Daniels, who had the courage to write about a very ordinary immigrant, aging woman, mother, daughter, who was trying to do her audit; she was being audited by the I.R.S., played by the most amazing Jamie Lee Curtis. I love you.\n\nI was given this gift of playing this woman who resonated so deeply with me and with so many people because at the end of the day, in whatever universe she was at, she was just fighting, fighting for love for her family.\n\nAnd Evelyn Wang was no one without Ke Huy Quan \u2014 Raymond Wong \u2014 and there was no joy in her life without Stephanie Hsu. The most amazing Stephanie Hsu and my hot dog lover, Jamie Lee Curtis, to Jonathan Wong, my producer, thank you for being there with us every step of the way. My manager, David Unger, and Kit Wong, who believed in me. And this is also for all the shoulders that I stand on, all who came before me who looks like me, and all who are going on this journey with me forward. So thank you for believing in us. Thank you. Thank you so much.",

            "description": "Is the G.O.P. beyond hope for two conservatives?",
            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "For decades, conservative values have been central to Bret Stephens\u2019s and David Brooks\u2019s political beliefs, and the Republican Party was the vehicle to extend those beliefs into policy. But in recent years, both the party and a radicalized conservative movement have left them feeling alienated in various ways. Now, with an extremist fringe seemingly in control of the House, the G.O.P. bears little resemblance to the party that was once their home. Bret and David got together to suss out what happened and where the party can go. Bret Stephens: Lately I\u2019ve been thinking about that classic Will Rogers line: \u201cI am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.\u201d A century or so later, it looks like the shoe is on the other foot. Is it even possible to call the Republican Party a \u201cparty\u201d anymore? David Brooks: My thinking about the G.O.P. goes back to a brunch I had with Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D\u2019Souza in the \u201980s that helps me see, in retrospect, that people in my circle were pro-conservative, while Ingraham and D\u2019Souza and people in their circle were anti-left. We wanted to champion Edmund Burke and Adam Smith and a Reaganite foreign policy. They wanted to rock the establishment. That turned out to be a consequential difference because almost all the people in my circle back then \u2014 like David Frum and Robert Kagan \u2014 ended up, decades later, NeverTrumpers, and almost all the people in their circle became Trumpers or went bonkers. Bret: Right, they weren\u2019t conservatives. They were just illiberal. David: Then in 1995 some friends and I created a magazine called The Weekly Standard. The goal was to help the G.O.P. become a mature governing party. Clearly we did an awesome job! I have a zillion thoughts about where the Republican Party went astray, but do you have a core theory?\n\nBret: I have multiple theories, but let me start with one: The mid-1990s was also the time that Newt Gingrich became speaker of the House and Fox News got started. Back then, those who were on the more intelligent end of the conservative spectrum thought a magazine such as The Weekly Standard, a channel such as Fox and a guy like Gingrich would be complementary: The Standard would provide innovative ideas for Republican leaders like Gingrich, and Fox would popularize those ideas for right-of-center voters. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. The supposed popularizers turned into angry populists. And the populists turned on the intellectuals. To borrow Warren Buffett\u2019s take about investing, the conservative movement went from innovation to imitation to idiocy. It\u2019s how the movement embraced Donald Trump as a standard-bearer and role model. All the rest, as they say, is Commentary. David: I think I\u2019d tell a similar story, but maybe less flattering to my circle. The people who led the Republican Party, either as president (Ronald Reagan through the Bushes), members of Congress (Jack Kemp, John McCain, Paul Ryan) or as administration officials and intellectuals (Richard Darman, Condi Rice) believed in promoting change through the institutions of established power. They generally wanted to shrink and reform the government but they venerated the Senate, the institution of the presidency, and they worked comfortably with people from the think tanks, the press and the universities. They were liberal internationalists, cosmopolitan, believers in the value of immigration. Bret: I\u2019d add that they also believed in the core values of old-fashioned liberalism: faith in the goodness of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, free speech, political compromise, the political process itself. They believed in building things up, not just tearing them down. I would count myself among them. David: Then the establishment got discredited (Iraq War, financial crisis, the ossifying of the meritocracy, the widening values gap between metro elites and everybody else), and suddenly all the people I regarded as fringe and wackadoodle (Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump, anybody who ran CPAC) rose up on the wave of populist fury.\n\nEverybody likes a story in which the little guy rises up to take on the establishment, but in this case the little guys rode in on a wave of know-nothingism, mendacity, an apocalyptic mind-set, and authoritarianism. Within a few short years, a somewhat Hamiltonian party became a Jacksonian one, with a truly nihilistic wing. Bret: Slightly unfair to Jackson, who at least opposed nullification, but I take your overall point. David: After many years of the G.O.P. decaying, the party\u2019s institutional and moral collapse happened quickly, between 2013 and 2016. In the 2000 Republican primaries I enthusiastically supported John McCain. I believed in his approach to governance and I admired him enormously. But by 2008, when he got the nomination, the party had shifted and McCain had shifted along with it. I walked into the polling booth that November genuinely not knowing if I would vote for McCain or Barack Obama. Then an optical illusion flashed across my brain. McCain and Obama\u2019s names appeared to be written on the ballot in 12-point type. But Sarah Palin\u2019s name looked like it was written in red in 24-point type. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said this publicly before, but I voted for Obama. Bret: I voted for McCain. If I were basing my presidential votes on the vice-presidential candidate, I\u2019d have thought twice about voting for Biden. On your point about populism: There have been previous Republican presidents who rode to office on waves of populist discontent, particularly Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But as presidents they channeled the discontent into serious programs and also turned their backs on the ugly fringes of the right. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and expanded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Reagan established a working relationship with Democratic House leaders to pass tax reform and gave amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. What\u2019s different this time is that populist feelings were never harnessed to pragmatic policies. As you say, it\u2019s just populism in the service of nihilism. David: So where does the G.O.P. go from here and where does the old core of the conservative movement go? Do they (we) become Democrats or a quiet left-wing fringe of what\u2019s become Matt Gaetz\u2019s clown show? Bret: When people get on a bad path, whether it\u2019s drinking or gambling or political or religious fanaticism, they tend to follow it all the way to the bottom, at which point they either die or have that proverbial moment of clarity. I\u2019ve been waiting for Republicans to have a moment of clarity for a while now \u2014 after Joe Biden\u2019s victory, or Jan. 6, the midterms, Trump\u2019s dinner with Kanye West. I had a flicker of hope that the Kevin McCarthy debacle last week would open some eyes, but probably not. Part of the problem is that so many Republicans no longer get into politics to pass legislation. They do it to become celebrities. The more feverish they are, the better it sells. On the other hand, some Republicans who conspicuously did well in the midterms were the \u201cnormies\u201d \u2014 people like Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia and Gov. Mike DeWine in Ohio. It gives me hope that the fever will eventually burn itself out, maybe after a few well-earned defeats. The solution here is some kind of Republican version of the old Democratic Leadership Council, which yanked left-wing Democrats back to the center after three consecutive presidential wipeouts and paved the way for the election of Bill Clinton.\n\nWhich raises another question for me, David: Where are the old brains and money trusts of the G.O.P., to give life and energy to that kind of effort? David: Well, it\u2019s not going to be me! Even in my red-hot youth, when I worked for Bill Buckley at National Review, I didn\u2019t see myself as a Republican, just a conservative. I maintain a distance from political parties because I think it\u2019s always wrong for a writer to align too closely to a party. That\u2019s the path to predictability and propagandism. Furthermore, I belong in the American tradition that begins with Alexander Hamilton, runs through the Whig Party and Lincoln, and then modernized with Theodore Roosevelt, parts of Reagan and McCain. I wasted years writing essays on how Republicans could maintain this tradition. The party went the other way. Now I think the Democrats are a better Hamiltonian home. Bret: I\u2019m part of the same conservative tradition, though maybe with a heavier dose of Milton Friedman. David: Our trajectories with the G.O.P. are fairly similar, and so are our lives. I\u2019m older than you, but our lives have a number of parallels. We both grew up in secular Jewish families, went to the University of Chicago, worked at The Wall Street Journal, served in Brussels for The Journal, and wound up at The Times. Bret: We also probably had many of the same professors at Chicago \u2014 wonderful teachers like Nathan Tarcov, Ralph Lerner, Fran\u00e7ois Furet, and Leon and Amy Kass \u2014 who taught me that Lesson No. 1 was to not succumb to the idea that justice is the advantage of the stronger, and to always keep an open mind to a powerful counterargument. That\u2019s not a mind-set I see with the current Republican leaders. David: When people ask me whether they should end a relationship they\u2019re in, I answer them with a question: Are the embers dead? Presumably when the relationship started there was a flame of love. Is some of that warmth still there, waiting to be revived, or is it just stone-cold ash? In my relationship with the G.O.P., the embers are dead. I look at the recent madness in the House with astonishment but detachment. Isaiah Berlin once declared he belonged to \u201cthe extreme right-wing edge of the left-wing movement,\u201d and if that location is good enough for old Ike Berlin, it\u2019s good enough for me. Bret: I wouldn\u2019t have had trouble calling myself a Republican till 2012, when I started to write pretty critically about the direction the party was taking on social issues, immigration and foreign policy. In 2016 I voted for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in my life, did it again in 2020, and I think of myself as a conservative-minded independent. If I haven\u2019t finalized my divorce from the G.O.P., we\u2019re definitely separated and living apart.\n\nDavid: I suppose I went through stages of alienation. By the early 2000s, I came to believe that the free market policies that were right to combat stagnation and sclerosis a few decades earlier were not right for an age of inequality and social breakdown. Then the congressional Republicans began to oppose almost every positive federal good, even George W. Bush\u2019s compassionate conservatism. Trump brought the three horsemen of the apocalypse \u2014 immorality, dishonesty and bigotry. The party, complicit in all that, is dead to me, even though, I have to say, a good chunk of my friends are Republicans. Bret: I\u2019m loath to give up completely on Republicans only because I believe a successful democracy needs a morally healthy conservative party \u2014 one that channels conservative psychological tendencies into policies to check heedless progressivism while engaging productively with an evolving world. I see no other plausible vehicle to advance those policies. Still, the party\u2019s road to recovery is going to be long and hard. And it\u2019s going to require some courageous and credible conservatives to speak up and denounce the current direction of the party. David: As for who is going to lead a Republican revival, I guess I\u2019d start in the states. One of Al From\u2019s insights in leading the Democratic Leadership Council was that change was going to come from the young and ambitious state legislators and governors, like Bill Clinton \u2014 a new generation of politicians from moderate parts of the country. But the Democrats had a strong incentive to change because they lost a lot of elections between 1968 and 1992. The country is now so evenly divided, it takes only a slight shift to produce victory, and nobody has an incentive to rethink his or her party. Bret: And, of course, when Republicans lose, they console themselves with the thought that it\u2019s because the other side cheated. David: If the Republican Party is to thrive, intellectually and politically, it will have to become a multiracial working-class party. A lot of people are already thinking along these lines. Oren Cass at American Compass has been pushing a working-class agenda. The Trumpish writers and activists who call themselves national conservatives are not my cup of tea, but they do speak in the tone of anti-coastal-elite protest that is going to be the melody of this party for a long time to come. To my mind, Yuval Levin is one of the brightest conservatives in America today. He runs a division at the American Enterprise Institute where the debates over the future of the right are already being held. The party will either revive or crack up, the way the Whig Party did. But it\u2019s going to take decades. If I\u2019m still around to see it, I\u2019ll be eating mush and listening to Led Zeppelin Muzak with the other fogeys at the Rockefeller Republican Home for the Aged. Bret: You may well be right about how long it takes. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to do so as a party of the working class. The natural place for the G.O.P. is as the party of economic freedom, social aspiration and moral responsibility \u2014 a party of risers, if not always of winners. Its archetypal constituent is the small-business owner. It wants less regulation because it understands from experience how well-intended ideas from above translate into onerous and stupid rules at the ground level. It doesn\u2019t mind big business per se but objects to moralizing C.E.O.s who try to use their size and incumbency to impose left-coast ideology. And it thinks there should be consequences, not excuses, for unlawful behavior, which means it looks askance at policies like bail reform and lax law enforcement at borders.\n\nThe problem is that Trump turned the party into a single-purpose vehicle for cultural resentments. It doesn\u2019t help that coastal elites do so much on their own to feed those resentments. David: We\u2019ve reached a rare moment of disagreement! Your configuration for Republicans was a product of long debates in the 20th century. Size-of-government arguments are going to be less salient. Values, identity and social status issues will be more salient. I think the core driver of politics across the Western democracies is this: In society after society, highly educated professionals have formed a Brahmin class. The top of the ladder go to competitive colleges, marry each other, send their kids to elite schools and live in the same neighborhoods. This class dominates the media, the academy, Hollywood, tech and the corporate sector. Many people on the middle and bottom have risen up to say, we don\u2019t want to be ruled by those guys. To hell with their economic, cultural and political power. We\u2019ll vote for anybody who can smash their machine. The Republican Party is the party of this protest movement. Bret: Another way of thinking about the class/partisan divide you are describing is between people whose business is the production and distribution of words \u2014 academics, journalists, civil servants, lawyers, intellectuals \u2014 and people whose business is the production and distribution of things \u2014 manufacturers, drivers, contractors, distributors, and so on. The first group makes the rules for the administrative state. The latter lives under the weight of those rules, and will continue to be the base of the G.O.P. By the way, since you mentioned earlier the need for new leaders to come from the states, is there anyone who particularly impresses you? And how do you feel about the quasi-nominee-in-waiting, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida? David: I\u2019m slightly bearish about DeSantis. He does a good job of being Trumpy without Trump, but I wonder if a man who apparently has net negative social skills and empathy can really thrive during an intimately covered national campaign that will last two years. Trump was at least funny, and to his voters, charismatic. Do you have any other candidates on your radar screen? Bret: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be either of the Mikes \u2014 Pious Pence or Pompous Pompeo. I like Nikki Haley personally and think she has a good mind and a terrific personal story. But I don\u2019t get the sense of much public enthusiasm for her beyond high-level donors.\n\nWhich brings me back to DeSantis. He seems to have figured out that the G.O.P. sits on a three-legged stool consisting of Trumpists, evangelicals and the business community. He\u2019s earned the respect of the first with his pugilistic jabs at the media, of the second with his attacks on Disney and his parental rights legislation, and of the third with an open-for-business approach to governance that has brought hundreds of thousands of people to Florida. Next to all that, the personality defects seem pretty surmountable. David: Sigh. I can\u2019t rebut your logic here. Save us, Glenn Youngkin! Bret: Final question, David: If you could rewind the tape to 1995, is there anything you or anyone in our circle could have done differently to save the Republican Party from the direction it ultimately took? David: In 1996 Pat Buchanan\u2019s sister, Kathleen, worked at The Standard as an executive assistant. A truly wonderful woman. We virulently opposed Pat in his presidential run that year. The day after he won the New Hampshire primary she smiled kindly at us and said something to the effect of: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll protect you guys when the pitchforks come. Bret: Given what happened to The Standard, it didn\u2019t work out as promised. David: I wish we had taken that Buchanan victory more seriously, since it was a precursor of what was to come. I wish we had pivoted our conservatism even faster away from (sorry) Wall Street Journal editorial page ideas and come up with conservative approaches to inequality, to deindustrialization, to racial disparities, etc. I wish, in other words, that our mentalities had shifted faster. But in truth, I don\u2019t believe it would have made any difference. Authoritarian populism is a global phenomenon. The Republicans were destined to turn more populist. The big question is, do they continue on the path to authoritarianism? Bret: I look back at the world of conservative ideas I grew up in, professionally speaking, and I see a lot worth holding on to: George Kelling and James Q. Wilson on crime, Nicholas Eberstadt on social breakdown, Linda Chavez on immigration, Shelby Steele on racial issues, Garry Kasparov on the threat of Vladimir Putin, and so on. I don\u2019t think the ideas were the core problem, even if not every one of them stands the test of time. The problem was that, when the illiberal barbarians were at the conservative gates, the gatekeepers had a catastrophic loss of nerve. Whether it\u2019s too late to regain that nerve is, to me, the ultimate question.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Mr. Bruni is a contributing Opinion writer who was on the staff of The Times for more than 25 years.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe chef of the Copenhagen restaurant Noma, ranked one of the world\u2019s best dining establishments, announced this week that it would close for regular service.\n\nIt was at Noma that I ate the most unsettling meal of my life. The most unsettling dish, I should say, though \u201cdish\u201d doesn\u2019t feel right, given that it wriggled and twitched. \u201cYou\u2019ll never taste a fresher shrimp in your life,\u201d the server who presented it to me promised, telling me to plop it in my mouth. But I was as frozen as it was fresh. When he returned minutes later, it was still moving \u2014 more slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to die soon,\u201d he said, in the tone of a priest administering last rites. \u201cIt might as well die for its intended purpose.\u201d All these years later, I have a vivid memory of how fast and hard I chomped down on it, lest it perk up and treadmill on my tongue. I have no recollection of its flavor. There\u2019s a metaphor here, and it applies not just to Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that stunned the world this week with an announcement that it would close for regular service at the end of next year, but to other internationally renowned, ardently coveted temples of gastronomy that are forever trying to dazzle self-regarding epicures with new stunts, novel sensations, modes of presentation that we hadn\u2019t imagined, flora and fauna rarely pinned down on a plate. Are they about so many things beyond the fundamentals of dining \u2014 things like ingenuity, philosophy, vanity, eccentricity \u2014 that they\u2019ve ceased to be restaurants in any conventional and sustainable sense? Are they performing such a rococo act for such a rarefied audience that they\u2019re on borrowed time?\n\nNoma has frequently topped rankings of the world\u2019s best restaurants since Ren\u00e9 Redzepi opened it two decades ago and began foraging, pickling and plating his way to outsize fame as a chef of extraordinary vision and exacting principles. But maintaining the standards of innovation and artistry that he\u2019d set for himself \u2014 and that pilgrims to Noma expected \u2014 required intricate work and an enormous staff, and Julia Moskin noted in an article in The Times that Noma and similarly elite restaurants were \u201cfacing scrutiny of their treatment of the workers, many of them paid poorly or not at all.\u201d Redzepi told Moskin that even though a meal at Noma is at least $500 per person now, the numbers just weren\u2019t adding up. He plans to turn Noma into a food laboratory that does occasional pop-up meals. \u201cWe have to completely rethink the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is simply too hard, and we have to work in a different way.\u201d \u201cIndustry\u201d is too broad a term. He\u2019s talking about a small, gilded chamber of it. And that chamber is past due for reassessment \u2014 not because it isn\u2019t a showcase for phenomenal creativity, not because it isn\u2019t a storehouse of remarkable pleasure, but because it has traveled so dizzily far from its truest mission to an altitude that too few people can reach. I write that as someone with enormous regard for Redzepi, with whom I spent time in and around Copenhagen in 2010. We foraged together in a patch of weeds by the sea. In a restaurant less expensive and more accessible than his, we lunched on smoked salmon and rye bread. We talked and talked. And I was wowed by the amount of thought that he\u2019d put into what he was doing \u2014 by his determination to show diners that with a sense of history, a surfeit of imagination and enough enterprise, he could take the finite patch of earth where he found himself and wring a seemingly infinite bounty of food and flavor from it. At Noma, almost everything I ate was either whimsically presented \u2014 langoustines arrived on a craggy rock, around which they did not crawl \u2014 or laboriously sourced. Some of it called for a botanical glossary. There was air-dried sea buckthorn. There were pickled ramson flowers.\n\nIt was fascinating and it was fun and I guess it was delicious, but it intensified a confusion that I had begun to feel \u2014 and had never fully copped to \u2014 during my stint as the restaurant critic of The Times from 2004 to 2009. I couldn\u2019t tell, when I breached a few of the more exclusive sanctums, whether I was there to eat dinner or to participate in a statement of some kind: about the luxury that I had entry to, about the chef\u2019s gastronomic scruples, about ambition, about experimentation. I know I\u2019m not alone. The current restaurant critic of The Times, Pete Wells, has entirely rethought the question of what sorts of establishments deserve attention and adulation. In June he gave three out of four stars to La Pira\u00f1a Lechonera, a food trailer in the South Bronx that serves Puerto Rican-style roast pork and is open only on Saturdays and Sundays. He wrote that it \u201cpacks more joy into two days than most restaurants do into a week.\u201d Joy, along with satiation: That seems to me a restaurant\u2019s highest calling, one that doesn\u2019t require the elaborate financial and logistical contortions of an ultra-high-end establishment that commits to paying its workers fairly and has customers who demand, or are at least accustomed to, revelatory ingredients and acrobatic preparations. Joy, along with satiation: I got them from that smoked salmon and rye. They didn\u2019t give me bragging rights or a story to tell. But they didn\u2019t ask for much, either. For the Love of Sentences\n\nThe Economist contextualized the hubbub over Elon Musk, Twitter and permitted versus censored tweets with this finely turned wisdom: \u201cFree expression is not a problem with a solution bounded by the laws of physics that can be hacked together if only enough coders pull an all-nighter. It is a dilemma requiring messy trade-offs that leave no one happy. In such a business, humility and transparency count for a lot.\u201d (Martha Eddison Sieniewicz, Cambridge, Mass.) In The Arizona Republic, Laurie Roberts evaluated Kari Lake\u2019s failed lawsuit to overturn state election results: \u201cLake and her attorneys offered no smoking gun. Not even a lightly used pea shooter.\u201d (Diane Cook, Seattle) In The Denver Herald, Kirsten Dahl Collins recalled the unusual beginnings of a Colorado church: \u201cIn the summer of 1860, four armed desperadoes invaded the offices of the newly launched Rocky Mountain News in Denver, gunning for editor William N. Byers. Luckily for the journalist, two Presbyterians walked in.\u201d (Andy Ferguson, Denver) In The Washington Post, Tim Carman appraised \u201cJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Family in Spain,\u201d a new streaming series: \u201cIt\u2019s a protracted Take Your Daughters to Work Day, when your father just happens to be a famous chef \u2014 and one of the world\u2019s biggest (non-cured) hams.\u201d (Alan Stamm, Birmingham, Mich.)

That\u2019s correct \u2014 tree. Singular. It\u2019s up a hill on the far side of the creek that runs through our neighborhood, and like a siren, it beckons her. Like a magnet, it pulls her. And then, like a crystal ball, it ensorcels her. It doesn\u2019t look much different from the countless trees around it, except that it has a snout-level indent \u2014 a nook, really \u2014 that must have once been the abode of some creature she yearns to meet (or eat). Is it still inhabited? I\u2019ve never detected any movement. But Regan smells something. Or senses something. Or simply imagines something. These are distinctions without a difference, because whatever is or isn\u2019t happening in that Lilliputian cave has held her rapt for months now. For a full year, actually. She studies the nook from various angles. She sniffs inside. She lurches forward, only to rear back. Her tail wags; her tail stills. I walk onward, down one of the nearby trails. She always follows a few minutes later, and while I like to think she\u2019s choosing me over tree, I suspect she simply knows we\u2019ll be circling back at walk\u2019s end. Her vigil isn\u2019t abandoned. It\u2019s just interrupted. Dogs teach us as much as we\u2019re willing to learn \u2014 about loyalty, about longing, about grit \u2014 but what\u2019s the lesson here? For a long time I wanted a parable with a tidy moral about sweetly stubborn hope or stupidly unbreakable habit. Then, recently, I realized that there was another way to look at it. A simpler one. The tree makes Regan happy. She likes sprinting toward it. She likes standing beside it. She likes its constancy. She likes its mystery. Having stuck her nose into much of this world, she has found a crevice that tickles it like no other. Why insist on any logic other than that?",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRussia replaces its commander in Ukraine after just three months.\n\nRussia has shaken up its military command in Ukraine, demoting its top commander after just three months in the job. The change reflects the difficulty that Russia finds itself in: Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who has largely failed to achieve any progress on the battlefield, will be replaced by Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who was one of the key architects of Moscow\u2019s ill-fated invasion in the first place.\n\nAfter his appointment in October, Surovikin launched waves of missile and drone attacks intended to cripple Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, leaving civilians without power and heat as winter set in. He had previously commanded Russian forces in Syria where he was known for bombing campaigns that targeted civilians. During his three months in command, the Russian military was forced onto the defensive in the south. Surovikin oversaw a retreat from the city of Kherson after heavy shelling by advancing Ukrainian forces made the Russian position there untenable. News of the shake-up came as intense fighting continued in the eastern town of Soledar. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the paramilitary Wagner Group of mercenaries, who make up a large part of the Russian force battling in Soledar, maintained in a Telegram post yesterday that his forces had seized control of the city, though he added that fighting was continuing. Ukraine said its forces were still defending Soledar. A Russian victory in Soledar, a salt-mining town north of Bakhmut, would be Russia\u2019s first tangible gain in the war since July, when its troops took control of Sieverodonetsk and Lysychansk in the Donbas. It would give Russian forces a springboard to press on toward Bakhmut, a ruined city that lies only 10 miles away and is now at the center of the war. But military experts say that taking Soledar would not signal that Bakhmut is about to fall. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, estimates that even if Russia captured Soledar, Ukraine could defend and resupply soldiers in Bakhmut.",

Here\u2019s the latest at the end of Wednesday.\n\nNassau County officials said that the first-term congressman, who faces inquiries into his finances, campaign spending and fabrications on the campaign trail, had lost the confidence of district Republicans and should step down. It is the sharpest denunciation to date from Santos\u2019s own party, whose leaders in Washington have mostly stayed mum. Representative Anthony D\u2019Esposito, who represents a neighboring district, said that he \u201cwill not associate with him in Congress\u201d and also called for Santos\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that Santos handed over to Long Island Republicans when he first considered running for office reads like a detailed road map of his lies. In other news from New York, a group of state lawmakers said it appeared that Yeshiva University might have misrepresented itself as a secular institution in order to qualify for more than $230 million in public funds.\n\n3. Russia shakes up its military leadership with a focus on stability. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who helped plan the initial stumbling invasion of Ukraine and who had served as President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military chief of general staff for over a decade, was named the new head of the Russian forces in Ukraine. Analysts said the selection \u2014 of a Kremlin apparatchik to replace a respected commander after just three months \u2014 shows that Putin is more interested in projecting stability than in improving Russia\u2019s darkening military outlook. In other news from the war, Ukraine said that the battle for Soledar is not over, despite Russian claims that the town has been seized. And regular power outages have forced some Ukrainians to resort to makeshift offices in places like department stores.\n\nWhile much of the state\u2019s south awoke this morning to blue skies, rain continued to fall in Northern California. More than 4.5 million residents were under flood watches. Officials continued their search for a 5-year-old who was snatched from his mother\u2019s arms by the floodwaters. The state\u2019s extended stretch of intense storms has been particularly challenging for California\u2019s more than 170,000 homeless residents. \u201cI\u2019ve just been paying attention to the wind,\u201d one man said from his tent. \u201cWondering which tree will crack next.\u201d The state\u2019s weather is expected to clear up over the next day or two before widespread precipitation arrives over the weekend.\n\n6. With flavored tobacco now banned in California, cigarette companies test the limits. Just weeks into a new state law prohibiting flavors, odors or \u201ctastes\u201d in tobacco products, including menthol, R.J. Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Newport, has begun marketing new products that offer \u201ca taste that satisfies the senses\u201d and \u201ca new fresh twist.\u201d Antismoking experts argue that the company is circumventing the law. The products contain a synthetic cooling agent, but R.J. Reynolds said that they do not have a \u201cdistinguishable taste or aroma other than tobacco.\u201d In other health news, nurses at two of New York City\u2019s major hospitals are on strike for a third day.\n\n7. Could you live an entire day without using any plastic? The journalist A.J. Jacobs gave it a shot. He wanted to see how challenging it would be to spend 24 hours without ever touching the material \u2014 and what plastic items are most difficult to go without. Jacobs couldn\u2019t use his phone, his toothpaste tube, many of his clothes or even his doorknob. Even stepping on his carpet was a violation. And when he took the subway, he brought a wooden folding chair with him so he didn\u2019t have to sit on the plastic seats. By the end of the day, he broke his rule 164 times.\n\n10. And finally, with one tweak, you can take professional-looking photos on your iPhone. When people think of smartphone photographs, they often are picturing selfies, on-the-go snaps or filtered images meant for social media. But some of the most popular phones now come equipped with pretty good cameras. And, if you\u2019re really looking to elevate your shots, consider using the format built for the pros: RAW.\n\nEditing a RAW file requires more work, but doing so also allows a photographer to have more control of the light and color in the image after it has been captured. And, in some cases, a RAW file will have enough pixels so that a significantly cropped photo can still look sharp. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

            "content": "Cardinal George Pell in Sydney in 2008. He later became one of the highest-ranking figures at the Vatican.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn adviser to Pope Francis and a prominent figure in Australia, Cardinal Pell went to prison on charges of abusing two boys in the 1990s, but a higher court later acquitted him.\n\nCardinal George Pell, an Australian cleric and adviser to Pope Francis who became the most senior Roman Catholic prelate to be sent to prison for child sexual abuse and was later acquitted of all charges, died on Tuesday in Rome. He was 81. The cause was complications of hip replacement surgery, according to Peter Comensoli, the archbishop of Melbourne, Australia, who confirmed the death in a post on Twitter. Cardinal Pell had gone to Rome to attend the funeral last week of Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Pell was for decades one of Australia\u2019s most powerful religious figures. A former athlete with a formidable intellect and a combative streak, he was a conservative voice heard regularly in the media, opposing abortion while defending the church against accusations of child abuse as the archbishop of the Melbourne diocese and then the Sydney diocese. His personal story, from his origins in the tiny town of Ballarat to his rise through the ranks of the Vatican, had at one time been inspirational to many Australian Catholics, said the journalist Lucie Morris-Marr, the author of \u201cFallen: The Inside Story of the Secret Trial and Conviction of Cardinal George Pell\u201d (2019).\n\n\u201cHe was really seen as a success story, a superstar, in effect,\u201d Ms. Morris-Marr said. \u201cBut, of course, the trajectory of his career and reputation have been terribly, irrevocably damaged, because of the child abuse allegations.\u201d From 2014 to 2019, Cardinal Pell was the Vatican\u2019s financial czar and third-in-command, and he tried to push through reforms to make its finances more transparent. Those efforts were truncated in 2017, when he was forced to return to Australia to face trial on charges of sex abuse dating to the 1990s. The case transfixed Australia \u2014 cameras met him at the airport when he arrived from Rome. In December 2018, Cardinal Pell was convicted by an Australian jury of five counts of child sexual abuse; the crimes, against two choir boys, were said to have occurred in 1996, during his time in Melbourne. He was sentenced to six years in prison in March 2019. Less than two years later, in April 2020, Australia\u2019s highest court overturned the conviction, saying there was \u201ca significant possibility\u201d that he was not guilty. Cardinal Pell maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings, portraying himself, in a news conference in Rome in 2017, as a victim of \u201crelentless character assassination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,\u201d he said. At his death, Cardinal Pell was facing a civil suit by the father of a now-deceased former choir boy contending that the cleric abused the boy when he was archbishop of Melbourne. In a statement, the claimant\u2019s lawyer said the suit would continue, adding: \u201cThere is still a great deal of evidence for this claim to rely upon.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a 2017 Australian government inquiry into the abuse of tens of thousands of children in churches, schools and other institutions over decades found that Cardinal Pell had been aware of the sexual abuse of children by other Roman Catholic priests as early as 1974 but had failed to take action. At the Vatican, Cardinal Pell had been lauded for his financial expertise and creative methods to protect the church from being bankrupted by cases involving claims of abuse. His promotion to Vatican treasurer in Rome followed a period of leadership in Australia during which church attendance declined but the institution\u2019s finances were secured. As archbishop of Melbourne, in October 1996 \u2014 two months before the alleged incidents that led to his conviction \u2014 Cardinal Pell set up what would become a firewall for the church\u2019s finances and reputation in connection with abuse accusations. He called it \u201cThe Melbourne Response.\u201d On paper, the \u201cresponse\u201d was an alternative resolution process for survivors. Cardinal Pell said it aimed to \u201cmake it easier for victims to achieve justice\u201d outside the courts. But it capped payments, initially at 50,000 Australian dollars (or $35,000 in U.S. currency), and usually forced victims to keep their traumas confidential. Cardinal Pell brought a similar approach to Sydney, where he was archbishop from 2001 to 2014. The response to his death in his native Australia was divided. Some said their thoughts would be with the victims of those abused by the Catholic Church, while others paid tribute to him \u2014 muted tribute, in some cases. In a statement, Archbishop Comensoli of Melbourne expressed \u201cgreat sadness\u201d at Cardinal Pell\u2019s death. \u201cMay eternal light now be his, who so steadfastly believed in the God of Jesus Christ,\u201d he wrote. Tony Abbott, a former Australian prime minister and Roman Catholic, told the newspaper The Australian that the cardinal had been a \u201csaint for our times.\u201d\n\nGeorge Pell was born in Ballarat, about 75 miles west of Melbourne, on June 8, 1941, to George Arthur and Margaret Lillian (Burke) Pell. His father, an Anglican of little religious conviction, was the manager of a gold mine and a former heavyweight boxing champion; his mother was a devout Catholic. He had a sister, Margaret, who died in 2021, and a brother, David, who survives him. George Pell grew up attending Mass weekly and confession once a month. He was a keen athlete as a youth, signing a contract to become a professional player of Australian rules football for a team in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, though he ultimately declined to pursue it. In his final year at a Catholic secondary school, in 1959, he decided to become a priest. \u201cI feared and suspected and eventually became convinced that God wanted me to do His work, and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction,\u201d he told an interviewer in 1997. \u201cI still marvel that I made the leap of being interested in it and thinking about it to saying, \u2018I\u2019ll have a go.\u2019\u201d",

            "section": "Climate",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn industry group is spending millions of dollars to push back against efforts to move heating away from oil and gas.\n\nFor D.I.Y. enthusiasts, Matt Blashaw is a familiar face, judging bathroom remodels or planning surprise home makeovers on popular cable television shows. Mr. Blashaw also has an unusually strong opinion about how Americans should heat their homes: by burning propane, or liquid petroleum gas. \u201cWhen I think of winter, I think of being inside. I think of cooking with the family, of being by a roaring fire \u2014 and with propane, that is all possible,\u201d he said on a segment of the CBS affiliate WCIA, calling in from his bright kitchen. \u201cThat\u2019s why we call it an energy source for everyone.\u201d Less well known is the fact that Mr. Blashaw is paid by a fossil fuel industry group that has been running a furtive campaign against government efforts to move heating away from oil and gas toward electricity made from wind, solar and other cleaner sources.\n\nThe Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, which is funded by propane providers across the country, has spent millions of dollars on \u201cprovocative anti-electrification messaging\u201d for TV, print and social media, using influencers like Mr. Blashaw, according to the group\u2019s internal documents viewed by The New York Times. As a federally-sanctioned trade association, PERC is allowed to collect fees on propane sales, which helps fund its marketing campaigns. But according to the law that created this system, that money is supposed to be used for things like research and safety. In 2023, the organization plans to spend $13 million on its anti-electrification campaign, including $600,000 on \u201cinfluencers\u201d like Mr. Blashaw, according to the documents, which were obtained from PERC\u2019s website as well as a public records request by the Energy and Policy Institute, a pro-renewables group.\n\nThe propane industry sees things differently. It needs to \u201ccombat the growing narrative that fossil fuel combustion is the main cause of climate change, and that propane is a dirty fossil fuel,\u201d Stuart Weidie, chairman and chief executive of North Carolina propane company Blossman Gas, told the propane council at a February 2021 meeting. Exxon\u2019s climate research. A new study published in the journal Science found that starting in the late 1970s, Exxon\u2019s scientists made remarkably accurate projections of just how much burning fossil fuels would warm the planet. Yet for years, the oil giant publicly cast doubt on climate science, and cautioned against any drastic move toward alternative resources. A controversial appointment. The decision by the United Arab Emirates to select the head of its national oil company to oversee the COP28 climate talks in Dubai this year has drawn ire from environmental groups. The move reflects the complex balancing act the United Arab Emirates is trying to pull off as the oil exporter prepares for a renewable future. Eight hot years. Scientists from the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that the last eight years were the warmest on record. Extreme summer temperatures in Europe, China and elsewhere contributed to 2022 being the fifth-hottest year on record; 2016 was the hottest year ever. U.S. carbon emissions. America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry rose last year, moving the nation in the opposite direction from its climate goals, according to preliminary estimates by a nonpartisan research firm. Emissions ticked up 1.3 percent, even as renewable energy surpassed coal power nationwide for the first time in over six decades. Parasitic populations According to a groundbreaking new study that analyzed 85 parasitic species, the majority of them suffered population declines over 140 years. The decline, seemingly driven by warming temperatures, suggests another unexpected way that climate change can harm ecosystems. \u201cThe movement to electrify everything is rapidly gaining momentum, and poses a substantial threat to the sustainability of our industry,\u201d he said, according to meeting minutes. Erin Hatcher, who heads communications at PERC, said its campaign \u201casserts propane\u2019s role in a clean energy future\u201d and \u201cpromotes the advantages of a wide path to decarbonization.\u201d Influencers like Mr. Blashaw, she said \u201cuse and specify propane in their construction projects and are very familiar with propane\u2019s advantages.\u201d Ms. Hatcher would not say how much her group has paid Mr. Blashaw. Mr. Weidie said that his fundamental belief in the importance of a low-carbon future had been \u201clost in out-of-context conversation.\u201d He said he believed electrification was set to \u201cplay a big role but is not the only answer,\u201d and that propane was \u201ca great energy for generations to come.\u201d Most American homes are heated by natural gas or oil. But in states where the energy grid is increasingly powered by wind, solar and other renewables, electric heat pumps are fast becoming a lower-carbon alternative to gas and oil. They heat as well as cool. Researchers at Princeton University found that for the United States to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050, nearly one-quarter of American homes would need to switch to heat pumps. That\u2019s double the number today.\n\nBut such a shift would reduce demand for propane, which is used in 50 million American homes, in furnaces, stoves, fireplaces and a range of appliances, according to the National Propane Gas Association. Propane, like natural gas, doesn\u2019t emit as much planet-warming greenhouse gases as coal, gasoline or diesel. But it\u2019s still derived from fossil fuels. \u201cIf you\u2019re burning gas to heat your house anywhere in a northern climate, it\u2019s a huge amount of emissions, probably the largest part of your emissions,\u201d said Forrest Meggers, an associate professor at Princeton. The propane industry\u2019s anti-electrification campaign has been particularly well funded because of PERC\u2019s status as a federally-sanctioned trade association. A 1996 law authorized the creation of PERC and allowed it to collect a half-cent fee on every gallon of propane it sells, an example of what is known as a federal \u201ccheckoff program\u201d designed to support specific industry sectors, typically agricultural commodities. Those fees are supposed to be used for safety and consumer education, training, or research and development projects. But ambiguous language in the original bill, together with limited oversight by the Department of Energy, has meant the group has diverted millions of dollars from the fee toward marketing, including its anti-electrification campaigns. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has repeatedly raised concerns that PERC has been misusing the funds it raises from the fee, which comes to more than $40 million a year, and criticized lax government oversight. PERC has also funded groups working on campaigns in response to federal and state climate policies, possibly violating a provision in the 1996 law that bans the organization from lobbying, the G.A.O. has warned.\n\nIn 2022, for example, PERC committed nearly $900,000 to a New York propane industry group to address the \u201cmassive challenge from well-funded efforts to electrify the entire state\u201d \u2014 namely, to fight policies stemming from New York\u2019s 2019 climate law which, among other goals, aims to ensure that buildings and vehicles stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2040. New York had passed \u201cthe most radical climate change legislation in the country\u201d and propane was \u201cmarked for extinction, along with natural gas, heating oil and gasoline,\u201d Rich Goldberg, whose public relations firm led the effort, warned last year in a blog post. The propane industry needed to run an \u201caggressive, fuel-neutral campaign aimed at slowing down the CLCPA electrification freight train,\u201d he said, referring to New York\u2019s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.\n\nOn social media and an opposition website, the local New York Propane Gas Association panned heat pumps as cripplingly expensive and unreliable, especially in cold climates, urging residents to oppose the state\u2019s climate plans. The group also lobbied against a state carbon tax, which failed to advance. The group\u2019s claim about heat pumps is misleading. Advances in technology mean the pumps are effective in colder regions, said Dr. Meggers of Princeton. Federal rebates of up to $8,000 for low- and moderate-income households, as well as various state-level incentives, have made heat pumps more affordable. And efficient heat pumps can save households hundreds of dollars a year, compared to oil and gas systems, according to the Department of Energy. Still, by the New York propane group\u2019s own accounting, its social media ads reached 2 million people, and its videos were shown more than 2.8 million times. \u201cPERC is running the largest national anti-electrification campaign I\u2019ve encountered anywhere in the United States,\" said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute. \u201cPropane customers, whether they\u2019re buying fuel for their home heating or for their grill, they\u2019re unwittingly funding PERC\u2019s anti-climate agenda.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Goldberg stood by his characterization of the New York climate law. \u201cPeople would be required to convert their energy use in their house, how they drive, how power is produced,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty extreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good news is that there are now better alternatives for cleaner school buses today, like propane school buses,\u201d she said, which could reduce tailpipe emissions for a far lower cost. Experts question that claim. For tailpipe emissions that could both harm kids\u2019 lungs and warm the planet, \u201celectric buses are going to change the game,\u201d said Hailin Li, a professor at West Virginia University. And with the federal government providing $5 billion toward electric school buses, there is little reason to go with propane, he said. Federal rules require broadcasters to announce when content has been sponsored or paid for in any way. CW39 did state that Ms. Calandrelli is working with \u201cEnergy For Everyone,\u201d but did not name the propane industry. Ms. Hatcher of PERC said TV networks were fully aware of their guests\u2019 sponsors. Ms. Calandrelli referred questions to PERC. CW39 did not respond to requests for comment.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nDo you solemnly swear to solve this puzzle by Victor Barocas?\n\nWEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Congratulations to Victor Barocas, who is making his 18th appearance in the New York Times Crossword. I felt that Mr. Barocas\u2019s puzzle was pretty tough for a Wednesday puzzle, although I had an inkling of what the theme might be before I reached the revealer, which helped me fill in some of the circled letters. Don\u2019t you just love when that happens? You\u2019ll be plugging along at a puzzle and suddenly notice that some letters in circles appear to be repeating, and it\u2019ll dawn on you, Hey, that\u2019s the theme! Before we talk about that theme, though, let\u2019s take a look at some clues that may have given solvers some trouble today.\n\n15A. I know not everyone is a fan of using the word ADULT as a verb (\u201cFulfill mundane but necessary responsibilities, in modern lingo\u201d), but, as a millennial, I admit I do call undertaking tasks like going to the post office or filing taxes ADULTing. 20A. \u201cDoes pranks with rolls, informally\u201d is the clue for TPS, short for \u201ctoilet papers.\u201d 28A. Today I learned about Lil REL Howery (\u201cActor/comedian Lil ___ Howery\u201d), who was in \u201cGet Out\u201d and also starred in his own self-titled television show \u201cREL.\u201d 35A. Solvers who live outside New York City could be forgiven for not knowing that NOLITA is a \u201cManhattan neighborhood next to SoHo.\u201d It comes from condensing \u201cnorth of Little Italy\u201d into one word. 54A. I love the optimism in the clue \u201cBeings not (yet) proven to exist\u201d for ETS, or extraterrestrials. It\u2019s not for lack of trying! 6D. I fell for the misdirect in \u201cOrg. promoting canine care,\u201d thinking it would be a veterinary organization of some sort. Instead, it\u2019s the American Dental Association, or ADA.\n\n8D. If, like me, you didn\u2019t know REL at 28A or ELGAR (\u201c\u2018Enigma Variations\u2019 composer\u201d), you may have had to guess at this crossing. Somehow, I was able to pull the correct letter from wherever ELGAR was buried deep within my brain.\n\n11D. When a clue is in French, the answer will most likely also be in French. \u201cP\u00e9pin le Bref, par exemple\u201d is French for \u201cP\u00e9pin the Short, for example.\u201d P\u00e9pin was a king, or, in French, un ROI. 45D. \u201cIt\u2019ll dawn on you\u201d is a lovely clue for DAY. 48D. Finally, \u201cUp-start?\u201d is the clue for SHORT U because the word \u201cup\u201d starts with a SHORT U sound. This puzzle features four groups of circled letters that illustrate the puzzle\u2019s theme, which is revealed along the bottom row: LIES UNDER OATH (\u201cWith 71- and 72-Across, commits perjury \u2026 or what can be found four times in this puzzle\u201d). Each set of circles contains a different \u201coath\u201d in the top row, and under each oath you\u2019ll find the word LIE. The first set of LIES UNDER OATH that I encountered was GOSH, contained within the entry CARGO SHIPS, over the word LIE, contained in YALIE. The other OATHs are EGAD (in MEGADEALS), DRAT (in BOND RATIO) and DANG (in DANGER SIGN). These are mild OATHs indeed, but lying under OATH is a serious crime that I would caution against, regardless of how tame the OATH might be. I appreciate Mr. Barocas\u2019s commitment to ensuring that his OATHs were all literal and figurative four-letter words. In his notes below, find out about the rejected options that were the wrong length.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHelmets and locks will be provided with the refurbished bikes, in an effort to help new arrivals settle in and find work.\n\nBike New York, a nonprofit group that promotes happenings like the annual Five Boro Bike Tour, is planning a giveaway. This one won\u2019t exactly imitate the time Oprah Winfrey said \u201cYou get a car! You get a car!\u201d and gave everyone in her studio audience a brand-new Pontiac. Bike New York will give away bicycles. Not new ones, but donated used bikes that have been refurbished by its Recycle-a-Bicycle shop. They will go to asylum seekers and other immigrants who have recently arrived in New York.\n\nThe goal is to provide an inexpensive, convenient and car-free way for them to access jobs and services around the city as they try to settle in. \u201cThey can\u2019t go on subways and buses \u2014 it\u2019s too expensive\u201d if they arrived with little money, said Kenneth Podziba, the president and chief executive of Bike New York. \u201cA bicycle will give them the freedom to see the whole entire city.\u201d Bike New York knows that bicycles can be stolen in New York, so with help from the lock manufacturer Kryptonite, Bike New York will tell the recipients of the bicycles: You get a lock! You get a lock! Safety is also a concern in a city where 17 cyclists were killed last year (down from a 20-year high of 28 in 2019), so Bike New York will say: You get a helmet! You get a helmet! The city\u2019s Department of Transportation has promised a helmet for everyone who is given a bicycle. Bike New York will teach the recipients how to ride if needed, with instructions in their native languages, Podziba said. It will also teach the rules of the road and provide free maintenance at Recycle-a-Bicycle \u201cuntil they get back on their feet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that there is this transformational power of cycling that will not only support their resettlement and integration but will help them thrive,\u201d Podziba said. \u201cOnce they can look for employment, bikes will help them get to their employment and get to job interviews. Maybe they have family who\u2019ve also come but don\u2019t live in the same area where they are. They could visit them. Right now it\u2019s an uphill battle for them. We just want to make things easier.\u201d\n\nPodziba said the size of the giveaway would depend on how many bicycles Bike New York collects in the next few weeks. He is seeking donations of bikes whose owners can do without them. He also wants building managers to empty out storage rooms where bicycles often languish long after their owners have moved away. Bikes can be donated from Thursday through Feb. 2 at three Manhattan locations of the bicycle-rental company Unlimited Biking; at Recycle-a-Bicycle at 858 Fulton Street in Brooklyn; and at a city warehouse at 66-26 Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village, Queens. Once refurbished, the bicycles will be distributed by the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, working with community organizations. Manuel Castro, the commissioner of immigrant affairs, said on Tuesday that 38,700 asylum seekers had arrived since last spring and that 26,100 remained in emergency shelters. Many new arrivals were sent on buses, a political stratagem by Republican governors in Texas and Arizona to capitalize on outrage over record crossings at the southern border and what they saw as a need for tighter security there. \u201cSo many people have arrived that any effort \u2014 in this case, collection of bikes \u2014 helps,\u201d Castro said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s compassion fatigue because this is an ongoing crisis. But you\u2019re seeing new efforts this come up because people in New York want to be helpful in a difficult situation. We\u2019re not going to stand by and see people suffer. That\u2019s the big picture here.\u201d Expect increasing clouds, with temperatures near the low 40s. At night, it\u2019s mostly cloudy, with temps in the upper 30s.\n\nWeisselberg will spend up to five months about five miles from there, at the Rikers Island jail complex. He was sentenced on Tuesday for his role in the tax fraud scheme that led to the conviction of Trump Organization last year. The company, which was convicted on the 17 counts it was charged with, will be sentenced on Friday. It faces penalties of up to $1.6 million. Weisselberg, who was the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, had faced years in prison until he agreed to a plea deal and testified as the prosecution\u2019s star witness. On Tuesday, Justice Juan Merchan said that if he had not promised the five-month sentence when he accepted the plea deal, he would have imposed a significantly longer sentence. \u201cThe entire case was driven by greed,\u201d Merchan said. The sentencing was the latest step in a precipitous fall for Weisselberg, whose ties to the Trumps have become tenuous. The Trump Organization parted ways with him as of Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He had been on paid leave and received an annual bonus for 2022, and is expected to be given a severance package. The Trump Organization has good reason not to alienate him. His testimony helped prosecutors win the conviction of the company, but Weisselberg has refused to turn against Trump himself in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation of the former president. Weisselberg\u2019s perspective could help as investigators look into Trump\u2019s role in hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. But his time in Rikers may not ease the pressure Weisselberg faces from the district attorney\u2019s office. Last year people with knowledge of the matter said that prosecutors were considering a new round of charges against him.",

            "content": "In California, R.J. Reynolds has begun marketing what it says is a new, non-menthol Newport cigarette. Antismoking advocates criticized the campaign as an attempt to circumvent the state\u2019s ban on flavored tobacco products.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nNow that California\u2019s tobacco prohibitions are in place, some Camel and Newport items are billed as newly \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201ccrisp\u201d non-menthol versions.\n\nR.J. Reynolds has wasted no time since California\u2019s ban on flavored tobacco went into effect in late December. \u201cCalifornia, We\u2019ve Got You Covered,\u201d the company declared in bold letters on a flier mailed to its cigarette customers. The law prohibits flavors, odors or \u201ctastes\u201d in tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. But antismoking experts argue that R.J. Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Newport brands, is trying to circumvent the ban by luring smokers with a suite of what it says are new non-menthol versions offering \u201ca taste that satisfies the senses\u201d and \u201ca new fresh twist.\u201d The campaign is viewed by critics as a provocation of California authorities who are supposed to enforce the ban, which includes a provision outlawing packaging or claims that suggest a product has a flavor. The Food and Drug Administration also is moving forward with a national plan to take menthol cigarettes off the market. To public health authorities, the potential reduction in smoking rates from a menthol ban could extend the length and quality of millions of lives. To R.J. Reynolds and other tobacco companies, the loss of sales from menthol cigarettes could be financially damaging.\n\nLuis Pinto, the vice president of communications at R.J. Reynolds, said in an email that the \u201cproducts introduced in California meet and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.\u201d He added that the new cigarettes \u201care not subject to the recently enacted ban because they do not have a distinguishable taste or aroma other than tobacco.\u201d But while not all tobacco-control experts are certain that the new products violate the California law, they do agree that the Reynolds marketing campaign reflects decades-long efforts by tobacco companies to protest and flout government regulations. Dr. Robert Jackler, a professor at Stanford Medicine who provided the ads to The New York Times, called the new marketing \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe thing that surprises me is there\u2019s no camouflage,\u201d said Dr. Jackler, who received the mailers along with staff members of Stanford\u2019s program on tobacco advertising. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018This is our menthol replacement. And by the way \u2014 wink, wink \u2014 it is not really menthol.\u2019\u201d The tobacco flavor ban in California initially took shape as a law passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020. Reynolds and others gathered signatures to let voters decide through a referendum on the issue. In November, 63 percent of voters approved the ban.\n\nFliers for the new products were mailed to Reynolds\u2019s customers who had sought coupons. They include ads for \u201cnew\u201d Camel and Newport varieties with \u201cbold, lasting flavor.\u201d The company\u2019s records of ingredients show that the Camel Crisp and the Newport EXP versions contain a synthetic cooling agent referred to as WS-3, according to Sven Jordt, a Duke University researcher who has written about the compound in e-cigarettes. Dr. Jordt said that the chemical had a cooling effect but not a minty odor or flavor, and that the health effects of the additive were unknown. While other countries have banned flavored tobacco or menthol, he said, only Germany and Belgium have prohibited this particular additive. Mr. Pinto, of Reynolds, said the cigarettes with the cooling agent \u201care not subject to the recently enacted ban because they do not have a distinguishable taste or aroma other than tobacco.\u201d A spokesman for Altria, which sells Marlboro cigarettes, said the company had stopped selling menthol cigarettes in California and was in compliance with the new law. Worldwide, tobacco companies have discovered loopholes to bans on menthol or flavored tobacco, studies show. In Canada, flavor cards and additive drops have been used to supplement unflavored products. In Denmark, smokers now have access to menthol sprays, capsules and tubes.\n\nDrafters of the California law had the international experience in mind, by outlawing flavor accessories and any claims that promote a flavored product. To Dr. Pamela Ling, the director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco, the message is clear. \u201cIf you squint at the ads, you\u2019re going to see this as a flavorful product, whether it says it or not,\u201d Dr. Ling said. \u201cThe colors, the packaging, the associations that your brain makes with the look and feel \u2014 that overrides the text that says this is not menthol.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements and packaging that so vividly suggest a flavor put a clear onus on California officials to respond to Reynolds, said Matt Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThis is Reynolds basically challenging California to say, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re serious,\u2019\u201d Mr. Myers said. If the state fails to take decisive action, he added, \u201cthe industry once again will escape.\u201d The products being marketed as \u201cnew\u201d also appear to challenge the authority of the F.D.A., according to Micah Berman, an associate professor of public health and law at Ohio State University. Under the Tobacco Control Act, products introduced after 2007 must be cleared by the agency, in part to keep tobacco companies from innovating to heighten the appeal of their products. \u201cI think this is something the F.D.A. should go back and take a look at,\u201d Mr. Berman said. Whether the products were cleared \u2014 and if they are \u201cnew,\u201d as advertised \u2014 is difficult for F.D.A. officials to immediately determine. That\u2019s because a 2016 legal defeat for the agency allows cigarette companies to change a product\u2019s name without informing the F.D.A. To find out which cigarette is in a particular package, the agency typically investigates or inspects records in a manufacturing facility, said Mitch Zeller, the former director of the F.D.A.\u2019s tobacco division.\n\nThe agency cleared one Camel product with an \u201calternative menthol\u201d flavor capsule in 2021. Reynolds declined to give The Times the authorization records for the California non-menthol cigarettes. Abigail Capobianco, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said that the agency closely monitored compliance with federal tobacco laws and regulations, and that it took corrective action when violations had occurred. But she declined to comment on the new products in California. The agency said it was finalizing its menthol rule and would \u201cnot allow entities to subvert the intent\u201d of the product standard. California\u2019s approach to the products will be an important bellwether of how a national menthol ban might play out, Dr. Ling said. Reynolds is \u201ctesting it out,\u201d Dr. Ling said. \u201cIf they\u2019re successful in pulling this off in California, they\u2019ll be totally prepared to circumvent a federal ban everywhere else.\u201d",

In short, do you find yourself thinking about everything but the task at hand? If you answered yes, you\u2019re not alone. As Dana G. Smith writes in today\u2019s featured article, \u201cSmartphones, pings and Insta-everything have shortened our attention spans.\u201d In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to get some old-school concentration back with tips from experts. The article you are about to read refers to a 2004 study which found that people averaged two and a half minutes on any given task before switching to something else. By 2012, the average time had dropped to 75 seconds. Now, we spend about 47 seconds on a task, on average. Discuss with a partner: Do these findings surprise you? Or do they resonate with your experience of trying to concentrate? What do you think could explain the shortening of our attention spans?\n\nHow long do you think you can focus on something before you get distracted? Test it out: Grab a stopwatch and start reading the featured article. How long can you read before your mind starts to wander, you get interrupted by a ding on your phone or your brain simply needs a break? Can you beat 47 seconds? If you could, how easy or difficult was that experience for you? What ultimately broke your concentration? Share what you noticed with your partner. Do you think you need to work on improving your concentration? If you were to try this again, what tips or tricks might you use to help stay focused? Read the article, then answer the following questions: 1. What does the study done by Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, show us about attention spans today? 2. What are three things, according to the article, that cause us to get distracted and grab our phones? Which of these, if any, do you tend to experience when you are trying to focus? 3. Turning off notifications is often suggested as a way to reduce distractions. Why won\u2019t this on its own solve the problem of distraction?\n\n4. The article offers three ways we can improve our focus. What are they? Which one sounds most useful for you and why? 5. Dr. Mark and Larry Rosen, a professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills, both favor taking tech breaks over going cold turkey and giving up technology altogether. Why? Have you ever tried to give up technology for an hour, a day or longer? How did it go for you? 6. Maryanne Wolf, a professor in residence at the University of California, Los Angeles Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, says reading on paper is better than reading on a screen. Why would that be? How often do you read on paper? Do you think it could help you focus? Why or why not? Choose one of the strategies for improving focus recommended in the article and try it out. For example:\n\u2022 None The next time you attempt a task you have trouble focusing on \u2014 such as doing your homework, practicing the piano or cleaning your room \u2014 instead of checking your phone whenever you feel like it, try focusing for 15 minutes and then giving yourself a two-minute tech break. Repeat until you finish the task.\n\u2022 None Or, try to increase your self-awareness around your tech use while doing this task. As the article says, \u201cWhen you have an urge to open Instagram, for example, ask yourself why: Do you feel exhausted and need a break? Will this help restore you? If so, go for it. After a few minutes, check in again and ask if the app is still giving you value. If not, it\u2019s time to get back to work.\u201d\n\u2022 None A third option: Try deep reading on paper. Open a physical book (start with something you want to read for pleasure), set an alarm for 20 minutes, put your phone on silent mode, and make yourself read slowly and deliberately. After you\u2019ve tried out one of these strategies, reflect on how it went for you using the following prompts. You might share your experiences with your classmates.\n\u2022 None How easy or difficult was it to sustain your attention using this strategy? Were you able to focus better than you usually do? What challenges did you encounter?\n\u2022 None When you did get distracted, what do you think caused it? Did a notification on your phone interrupt you? Did you self-interrupt? Did your brain just need a break? What does this tell you about yourself, and what might help you to stay focused next time?\n\u2022 None As Dr. Mark notes, improving your concentration takes practice. Do you think you will continue using this strategy when you need to focus? Why or why not? How do you think increasing your attention span could improve your life?",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Concerns raised by the nation\u2019s top consumer watchdog about the health hazards posed by gas stoves have triggered a sharp rebuke from the oil and gas industry and its Republican allies, inserting a common kitchen appliance into the middle of partisan politics. Critics were pushing back hard on Wednesday against recent comments made by Richard Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, that his agency might take some regulatory action in the face of growing research that links gas stoves to pollutants that harm both human health and the environment. \u201cThis is a hidden hazard,\u201d Mr. Trumka said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. \u201cAny option is on the table. Products that can\u2019t be made safe can be banned.\u201d Those words were echoing around a Wednesday breakfast meeting of the American Petroleum Institute, where the oil and gas industry and its supporters in Congress had gathered to discuss the upcoming legislative agenda.\n\nMr. Trumka had tried to quell the firestorm on Monday. \u201cTo be clear, C.P.S.C. isn\u2019t coming for anyone\u2019s gas stoves,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, adding that any regulations would apply to new products. At an October meeting of the commission, Mr. Trumka wanted the staff to begin writing rules regarding gas stoves but could not get support from the other four members. Instead, the commission agreed to obtain input from the public. A White House spokesman, Michael Kikukawa, said President Biden does not want to prohibit gas stoves. \u201cThe President does not support banning gas stoves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans remained outraged, with Ms. McMorris Rodgers promising to scrutinize the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \u201cWe will do oversight,\u201d she said, adding that she questioned some of the newest research linking gas stoves to asthma. At least one Democrat joined the fray. \u201cThis is a recipe for disaster,\u201d Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cThe federal government has no business telling American families how to cook their dinner. I can tell you the last thing that would ever leave my house is the gas stove that we cook on.\u201d Mike Sommers, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said a ban on gas stoves was \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d He predicted a backlash from homeowners across the country. Gas stoves are used in about 35 percent of households nationwide, or about 40 million homes. Researchers have increasingly documented significant indoor air pollution and negative health impacts from gas stoves. A study published in December estimated that gas-burning stoves are responsible for 12.7 percent of childhood asthma in the United States. Gas stoves emit nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter when they are turned on, sometimes at levels that exceed guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization. They also release other harmful air pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer, and can even leak those chemicals when they are turned off. The debate over proposals to limit the use of gas in homes because of its impact on climate change and public health has grown since 2019, when Berkeley became the first city in the country to ban gas hookups in most new homes and buildings. Since then, dozens of cities in California and across the country have enacted similar ordinances that target not just gas stoves, but other appliances like gas-fired furnaces and water heaters. On Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York proposed that the legislature phase out the sale of fossil fuel heating equipment in existing residential buildings beginning in 2030 and require new residential and commercial buildings be all-electric by 2025 and 2030, respectively.",

            "section": "Science",
            "content": "A spacewalk by two Russian astronauts was canceled at the last minute in December after mission controllers noticed a spray of particles leaking from the attached Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe capsule that carried three astronauts to orbit was damaged in December and will be replaced by another Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian space agency said on Wednesday that it would send an empty Soyuz capsule to the International Space Station in February to replace a damaged spacecraft currently docked there. \u201cThis is the next Soyuz that was scheduled to fly in March,\u201d said Joel Montalbano, the space station program manager at NASA, during a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019ll just fly a little earlier.\u201d The need for a new Soyuz arose after the one docked at the space station started spewing a spray of white particles on Dec. 14. The particles turned out to be coolant from the spacecraft, raising questions about whether part of the capsule could overheat during flight, rendering the craft unsafe to transport astronauts back to Earth.\n\nThe Soyuz is the only model of spacecraft Russia is using to transport astronauts to and from the I.S.S. The damaged vessel had arrived there in September, taking Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitriy Petelin of Russia and Frank Rubio of NASA to the space station. They had been scheduled to return to Earth in March, but the astronauts will now remain in orbit for several more months.\n\nThe next Soyuz, which would have carried three astronauts \u2014 two from Roscosmos, the state corporation that oversees Russia\u2019s space industry, and one from NASA \u2014 will now launch with its seats empty on Feb. 20. After it reaches the space station, the damaged Soyuz will make a passengerless return to Earth, probably sometime in March. It is set to land at the usual return site in Kazakhstan, carrying some experiments and cargo. After the leak occurred, astronauts used a camera at the end of a robotic arm on the space station to inspect the leak as engineers on the ground studied the damaged area. Analysis indicated that with astronauts aboard, temperatures could rise to 100 degrees or hotter with high humidity within the confined space of the compromised Soyuz. That would not only pose dangers to the crew but could cause equipment like the Soyuz\u2019s computer to malfunction. Until the replacement Soyuz arrives, there is a higher level of risk in case of an emergency \u2014 like a large leak that might require an evacuation. The Soyuz and a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule serve as emergency lifeboats for the seven astronauts currently on the station. But officials were measured about the risks.\n\n\u201cI will tell you, there is no immediate need for the crew to come home today, that all the systems are operating,\u201d Mr. Montalbano said. During the news conference on Wednesday, Sergei Krikalev, executive director of the human spaceflight programs for Roscosmos, said the astronauts would try to remain on the station. In case of a leak, for example, they could close hatches to minimize the leak. But in some situations, the risk of returning in a damaged Soyuz would be lower than the risk of not leaving. \u201cThe Soyuz is not good for nominal re-entry,\u201d Mr. Krikalev said, \u201cbut in case of emergency, with extra risk, we are going to use this Soyuz.\u201d Mr. Montalbano said there had been discussions with SpaceX to see whether, for an emergency evacuation, it would be possible for one of the Soyuz crew to travel back to Earth in the Crew Dragon. Mr. Krikalev said an investigation concluded that the damage was caused by a micrometeoroid about one millimeter in diameter that was traveling about seven kilometers a second, or more than 15,000 miles per hour. The micrometeoroid hit a radiator on the Soyuz, causing the coolant leak. The location of the leak, at the end of the Soyuz farthest from the docking port, made it essentially impossible to attempt a repair in space. \u201cYou need not only to repair a hole but also to fill the radiator with a liquid, with a coolant,\u201d Mr. Krikalev said. \u201cAnd the procedure is so difficult and so risky that much less risk would be to just replace the vehicle.\u201d Mr. Krikalev said that based on the direction and speed, it could not have been a piece of orbital debris from a rocket part or some other human-made object. The question was prompted in part by a Russian antisatellite weapon test in November 2021 that created a debris cloud in orbit, which posed a risk to the space station.",

            "section": "Arts",
            "content": "Jeff Beck performing in 1969. He was one of the most influential guitarists in rock history.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHis playing with the Yardbirds and as leader of his own bands brought a sense of adventure to their groundbreaking recordings.\n\nJeff Beck, one of the most skilled, admired and influential guitarists in rock history, died on Tuesday in a hospital near his home at Riverhall, a rural estate in southern England. He was 78. The cause was bacterial meningitis, Melissa Dragich, his publicist, said. During the 1960s and \u201970s, as either a member of the Yardbirds or as leader of his own bands, Mr. Beck brought a sense of adventure to his playing that helped make the recordings by those groups groundbreaking. In 1965, when he joined the Yardbirds to replace another guitar hero, Eric Clapton, the group was already one of the defining acts in Britain\u2019s growing electric blues movement. But his stinging licks and darting leads on songs like \u201cShapes of Things\u201d and \u201cOver Under Sideways Down\u201d added an expansive element to the music that helped signal the emerging psychedelic rock revolution.\n\nIn 1975, when Mr. Beck began his solo career with the \u201cBlow by Blow\u201d album, he reconfigured the essential formula of that era\u2019s fusion movement, tipping the balance of its influences from jazz to rock and funk, in the process creating a sound that was both startlingly new and highly successful. \u201cBlow by Blow\u201d became a Billboard Top 5 and, selling a million or more copies, a platinum hit. Along the way, Mr. Beck helped either pioneer or amplify important technical innovations on his instrument. He elaborated the use of distortion and feedback effects, earlier explored by Pete Townshend; intensified the effect of bending notes on the guitar; and widened the range of expression that could be coaxed from devices attached to the guitar like the whammy bar. Drawing on such techniques, Mr. Beck could weaponize his strings to hit like a stun gun or caress them to express what felt like a kiss. His work had humor, too, with licks that could cackle and leads that could tease.\n\n\u201cEven in the Yardbirds, he had a tone that was melodic, but in your face \u2014 bright, urgent and edgy,\u201d wrote Mike Campbell, of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, for an article in Rolling Stone magazine to accompany a poll that named Mr. Beck the fifth greatest guitar player of all time. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s saying: \u2018I\u2019m Jeff Beck. I\u2019m right here. You can\u2019t ignore me.\u2019\u201d \u201cEverybody respects Jeff,\u201d Mr. Page said in a 2018 documentary titled \u201cStill on the Run: The Jeff Beck Story.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinary musician. He\u2019s having a conversation with you when he\u2019s playing.\u201d Despite the accolades, Mr. Beck never achieved the sales or popularity of the guitarists considered to be his peers, including Mr. Page, Mr. Clapton and one of the players he admired most, Jimi Hendrix. Only two of his albums achieved platinum status in the United States, including \u201cWired,\u201d his 1976 follow-up to \u201cBlow by Blow.\u201d \u201cPart of the reason is never having attempted to get into mainstream pop, rock or heavy metal or anything like that,\u201d he told the arts website Elsewhere in 2009. \u201cShutting those doors means you\u2019ve only got a limited space to squeeze through.\u201d It hurt, too, that the mercurial Mr. Beck often worked without a lead singer, and that his groups seldom lasted long. His first band, with Mr. Stewart and Mr. Wood, stood on the cusp of superstardom, with an invitation to play Woodstock. But Mr. Beck turned down the offer, and the group dissolved shortly thereafter. Another band he led that held commercial promise, Beck, Bogert & Appice (featuring the rhythm section of Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice, formerly of Vanilla Fudge) earned a gold album in 1973, but Mr. Beck scotched the project after less than two years. Not that he minded his status in the industry.\n\nEven so, he earned eight gold albums over more than six decades. He also amassed seven Grammys, six in the category of best rock instrumental performance and one for best pop collaboration with vocals. He was inducted into the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame twice, as part of the Yardbirds in 1992 and as a solo star in 2009. \u201cJeff Beck was on another planet,\u201d Mr. Stewart said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cHe took me and Ronnie Wood to the USA in the late 60s in his band the Jeff Beck Group, and we haven\u2019t looked back since. He was one of the few guitarists that when playing live would actually listen to me sing and respond. Jeff, you were the greatest, my man.\u201d Geoffrey Arnold Beck was born on June 24, 1944, in South London to Arnold and Ethel Beck. His mother was a candy maker, his father an accountant. Mr. Beck told Guitar Player Magazine in 1968 that his mother had \u201cforced\u201d him to play piano two hours a day when he was a boy. \u201cThat was good,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it made me realize that I was musically sound. My other training consisted of stretching rubber bands over tobacco cans and making horrible noises.\u201d He became attracted to electric guitar after hearing Les Paul\u2019s work and was later drawn to the work of Cliff Gallup, lead guitarist for Gene Vincent\u2019s band, and the American player Lonnie Mack. He became entranced not only by the sound of the guitar but also by its mechanics.\n\n\u201cAt the age of 13, I built two or three of my own guitars,\u201d Mr. Beck wrote in an essay for a book about his career published in 2016 titled \u201cBeck 01: Hot Rods and Rock & Roll.\u201d \u201cIt was fun just to look at it and hold it. I knew where I was headed.\u201d He enrolled in Wimbledon College of Art but spent more time playing in bands. Dropping out of school, he began to do studio session work and in 1965 was invited to join the Yardbirds through Jimmy Page, whom Mr. Beck had befriended as a teenager and who had just turned that job down. Though he was with the Yardbirds for only 20 months, Mr. Beck played on most of their successful songs, starting with \u201cHeart Full of Soul,\u201d which broke the Top 10 in Billboard and got to No. 2 in Britain. It was fired by his burning lead guitar line, which took influence from Indian music and which served as the song\u2019s hook. In 1966, the Yardbirds\u2019 single \u201cShapes of Things,\u201d which got to No. 11 in the United States (No. 3 in Britain), included a frantic double-time solo by Mr. Beck that became one of the band\u2019s most celebrated showcases.\n\nA signature instrumental with a complex, unfolding structure, the song wasn\u2019t released at the time, dashing Mr. Beck\u2019s hope that this lineup would comprise his next band. Instead, he soldiered on with the Yardbirds, who then added Mr. Page, first on bass and later in a dueling lead guitar role with Mr. Beck. That fleeting lineup was immortalized in \u201cBlow Up,\u201d the Mod-era film by the director Michelangelo Antonioni, in which they performed a manic version of their song \u201cTrain Kept A-Rollin,\u2019\u201d recast as \u201cStroll On.\u201d Tensions which had been brewing between Mr. Beck and the rest of the Yardbirds came to a boil on an exhausting U.S. tour that fall, compelling him to quit. He later considered this period the low point of his career. \u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019re nobody,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2016. \u201cBecause the band were able to carry on\u201d with Mr. Page, \u201cit was almost like I was airbrushed out of it.\u201d Even so, a single was released under his own name in March 1967, \u201cHi-Ho Silver Lining,\u201d which featured a rare vocal by Mr. Beck, which he abhorred. \u201cI sound unbearably bad,\u201d he told Music Radar in 2021. Still, the song got to No. 15 in Britain, and its B-side provided a home for \u201cBeck\u2019s Bolero.\u201d He found more satisfaction by forming the first Jeff Beck Group, with Mr. Stewart, Mr. Wood, and Mr. Hopkins along with the drummer Mickey Waller. Columbia Records signed them and issued their debut, \u201cTruth,\u201d in the summer of 1968. It boasted a new, heavier version of the Yardbirds\u2019 \u201cShapes of Things,\u201d along with \u201cBeck\u2019s Bolero.\u201d \u201cTruth\u201d got to No. 15 in Billboard and went gold, fired by its fresh mix of booming rock and emotive soul. Its follow-up, \u201cBeck-Ola,\u201d which subbed the drummer Tony Newman for Mr. Waller, was released a year later and mirrored the debut\u2019s success. But the band imploded almost immediately after.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Mr. Beck began to do prodigious session work, providing solos on albums by Jon Bon Jovi, Roger Waters, Kate Bush, Tina Turner and others. He showed the continued breadth of his style with his \u201cEmotion & Commotion\u201d album in 2010, which included the standard \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d and Puccini\u2019s \u201cNessun Dorma.\u201d The latter track won a Grammy, and the album reached No. 11 in Billboard. Over the next few decades, Mr. Beck continued to tour and to record, most recently yielding a collaboration album with the actor and guitarist Johnny Depp, titled \u201c18,\u201d in 2022. Mr. Beck married Sandra Cash in 2005, and she survives him. To his fans, and to himself, Mr. Beck was so deeply identified with his guitar \u2014 particularly the Fender Stratocaster \u2014 that he seemed inseparable from it. \u201cMy Strat is another arm,\u201d he told Music Radar. \u201cI\u2019ve welded myself to that. Or it\u2019s welded itself to me, one or the other.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a tool of great inspiration and torture at the same time. It\u2019s forever sitting there, challenging you to find something else in it. But it is there if you really search.\u201d",

            "content": "Judges in 19 states and the District of Columbia are now empowered to issue orders to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed dangerous.\n\nIn the Bruen decision, a six-justice majority struck down a law that required people seeking a license to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate that they had a \u201cproper cause.\u201d The Second Amendment, Justice Thomas wrote for the majority, protects \u201can individual\u2019s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.\u201d The gun law, he wrote, gave local officials too much discretion and placed an intolerable burden on Second Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Thomas wrote that states remained free to ban guns in sensitive places, giving a few examples: schools, government buildings, legislative assemblies, polling places and courthouses. But he cautioned that \u201cexpanding the category of \u2018sensitive places\u2019 simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of \u2018sensitive places\u2019 far too broadly.\u201d\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., wrote that laws that used objective criteria in deciding who is entitled to carry guns in public remained presumptively constitutional. States were generally free to require, he wrote, \u201cfingerprinting, a background check, a mental health records check, and training in firearms handling and in laws regarding the use of force.\u201d\n\nAfter the decision, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York convened an extraordinary legislative session to seek an alternative law, vowing to combat a \u201cgun violence crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may think they can change our lives with the stroke of a pen, but we have pens, too,\u201d she told reporters during the session, in July. State lawmakers ultimately passed a new law that they said protected public safety while complying with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. But in November, Judge Glenn T. Suddaby of the Federal District Court in Syracuse, N.Y., blocked many aspects of the new law in a 184-page opinion that drew on the methodology endorsed by the Supreme Court in the Bruen decision. Judge Suddaby blocked the law\u2019s \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement along with some disclosures called for by the law, including the identification of family members and social media accounts. He also halted the law\u2019s restrictions on carrying guns in, among other places, houses of worship, public parks, zoos, buses, theaters and establishments serving alcohol. The judge also blocked the law\u2019s prohibition on carrying firearms onto private property without the owner\u2019s consent. A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit put Judge Suddaby\u2019s ruling on hold while an appeal moved forward. The plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to step in. The new law\u2019s \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement, the plaintiffs wrote, \u201cis no less subject to the unbridled discretion of licensing officials and makes the licensing process even more difficult than before.\u201d And its ban of guns in sensitive places, they wrote, encompasses almost the entire state. The new law, they wrote, \u201cwas designed not as a public safety measure, but rather a political statement demonstrating New York\u2019s contempt for this court\u2019s Bruen decision.\u201d\n\nIn response, lawyers for the state urged the Supreme Court to leave the new law in place while legal challenges moved forward. The state\u2019s brief said the plaintiffs had not suffered the sort of injury that gave them standing to sue, noting that five of them had licenses to carry guns and that the sixth had not tried to secure a license. The brief added that the \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement had been an independent feature of New York\u2019s licensing law for more than a century and was needed to ensure that licenses were given to law-abiding citizens who would not endanger themselves or others. The \u201cproper cause\u201d requirement struck down in Bruen, the filing said, had a different purpose: requiring a special justification for carrying a gun. The state\u2019s lawyers said in the brief that the plaintiffs had overstated the sweep of the new law\u2019s restrictions on carrying guns in sensitive places. The law\u2019s limits, the lawyers said, tracked \u201clongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms in places like fairs, markets, election sites, places of worship, courts, schools, places of public assembly and so forth.\u201d",

            "section": "Technology",
            "content": "J.D. Biersdorfer, whose first camera was the Pentax K1000, has been writing a technology column for The Times since 1998.\n\nRAW files provide more data for a photo-editing program to use. Here, an enhanced image of Lower Manhattan captured in Apple\u2019s ProRAW format on an iPhone 14 Pro Max and edited in Adobe Lightroom, right on the phone.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nProfessional photographers have long used the RAW format and editing software to turn image files into gorgeous pictures \u2014 and you can, too.\n\nHow to Make Your Smartphone Photos So Much Better\n\nSmartphone cameras and the software that automatically processes the images have become so good at creating fantastic photos on the fly that most people don\u2019t even carry a separate camera anymore (well, except for some Gen Z-ers going retro). There are plenty of apps that can slap a filter on a picture to make it look even better, but if you really want to elevate your mobile photography skills, consider the format the pros use: RAW. Editing a RAW file is more work, but it allows the photographer to have more control of the light and color in the image after it\u2019s been captured \u2014 and in some cases, enough pixels to significantly crop the photo and still have it look sharp. Here\u2019s a guide to getting started. \u201cRAW\u201d means raw data \u2014 and lots of it. Many phone cameras automatically capture and save images as JPEG or HEIC files, which crunch down and discard some of the image data to reduce the file size. However, when you choose to capture images as RAW files, you get uncompressed and unprocessed data from the camera\u2019s sensor. Without the compression, RAW images contain more detail and colors to work with. But the files can be huge.\n\nA 48-megapixel file allows for photos with good detail even with significant cropping, but the file size of each photo can be 75 megabytes or larger. If you have an iPhone with a terabyte of space, the larger file sizes are less of a problem, but phones with less storage can run out of space fast. Only images taken with the iPhone\u2019s main camera can be saved at the 48-megapixel resolution. Those snapped with the phone\u2019s wide-angle or telephoto cameras (or photos captured in night mode or with a flash) are automatically saved at the 12-megapixel resolution. Finding the RAW settings on an Android phone varies based on the device and its manufacturer, so check your phone\u2019s support site for specific instructions. If you have one of Google\u2019s Pixel phones running Android 13, go to the Camera app and tap the Down arrow in the upper-left corner, then choose More Settings and then Advanced. Next, tap the button next to RAW + JPEG control. The camera will capture the image in both JPEG and RAW formats, but it saves the larger files into a separate RAW folder on the Google Photos app.\n\nAt first glance, RAW files can seem flat, murky and bulky. But once you start to process them in a compatible photo-editing program, you can take advantage of all that extra data. In the editing app, you can use the onscreen slider and other controls to adjust an image\u2019s white balance, which neutralizes color casts; change the exposure; pull parts of the picture out of shadows; deepen colors and more. Some photographers prefer to handle RAW files using tools in Adobe Lightroom, which have mobile versions for Android, iPhone and iPad devices (free, with in-app purchases). Adobe\u2019s site has a tutorial, as do many websites specializing in digital photography. To edit your photos on a bigger screen, you can store the files in a cloud server or transfer the file from your mobile device to a desktop computer using Wi-Fi or AirDrop, and then use either Adobe Lightroom\u2019s subscription desktop version or one of the many desktop photo apps (including Apple\u2019s Photos for Mac).",

            "section": "Movies",
            "content": "Welcome to the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards. I am your host, Jerrod Carmichael, and I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here because I\u2019m Black.\n\nI\u2019ll catch everyone in the room up. If you settle down a little bit, I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s been going on. This show, the Golden Globe Awards, did not air last year because the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which I won\u2019t say they were a racist organization, but they didn\u2019t have a single Black member until George Floyd died. So do with what information what you will.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you how I got here, why am I here on the stage with you guys tonight. Well, I was at home just drinking tea. And I got a phone call from my man Stephen Hill. Stephen Hill is a great producer and he said, \u201cJerrod, really I\u2019m honored to be making this phone call.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m producing the 80th Golden Globes, and it would be an honor if you would agree to join as the host.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhoa. Like, one minute you\u2019re making tea at home, the next you\u2019re invited to be the Black face of an embattled white organization.\u201d Life really comes at you fast, you know.\n\nSo I said, \u201cStephen, I\u2019m torn, I\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m a little torn because, you know, one, it\u2019s a great opportunity, thank you for the call, but I\u2019m only being asked to host this, I know, because I\u2019m Black.\u201d And Stephen said, \u201cLet me stop you right there, Jerrod.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are being asked to host this show because you are talented. You\u2019re being asked to host this show because you are charming.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re being asked to host this show because you are one of the greatest comedians of our generation.\u201d\n\nBut Stephen\u2019s Black, so what does he know? Like, he\u2019s only producing this show because \u2014 they\u2019re not going to tell him why he\u2019s here, either \u2014 so I said, \u201cStephen, this is a lot for me, let me call you back.\u201d\n\nSo I did what I do when I have a moral, racial dilemma. I call the home girl Avery who, for the sake of this monologue, represents every Black person in America. And I said to Avery, I said, \u201cAvery, they asked me to host, and I said, you know, what should I do?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, bookie, I\u2019m so proud of you, now remind me, which awards show is that again?\u201d And I told her what the show was, and I told her about how last year didn\u2019t air because of the no-Black-people thing. And she was like, \u201cWell, how much are they paying you?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, Avery, it\u2019s not about the money honestly, it\u2019s about the moral question of \u2014\u201d And she said, \u201cJerrod, enough of all that, how much are they paying you?\u201d And I said, \u201c$500,000.\u201d And she said, \u201cBoy, if you don\u2019t put on a good suit and take some white people money \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd I kind of forget that, like, where I\u2019m from, like, we all live by a strict take-the-money mentality. I bet Black informants for the F.B.I. in the \u201960s, their families were still proud of them like they were \u2014 like, \u201cDid you hear about Clarence\u2019s new job? They\u2019re paying him $8 an hour just to snitch on Dr. King. It\u2019s a good government job.\u201d\n\nAnd I called Stephen back, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to do this.\u201d And I was really proud of that decision until I got an email from my publicist saying that Helen, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, wanted to have a one-on-one sit-down with me and I said, no thanks. I know a trap when I hear a trap, and I thought it went away, then it came back.\n\nI was like, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not really asking, Jerrod, they\u2019re insisting that you take the meeting.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOr what? They\u2019re going to fire me? \u201cThey haven\u2019t had a Black host in 79 years, they\u2019re going to fire the first \u2014 I\u2019m unfireable.\u201d\n\nAnd it came back again a third time, they were, like, \u201cYou know, Jerrod, Helen really just wants to educate you on the changes that the organization has made in regards to diversity.\u201d And I\u2019ll be totally honest with everyone here tonight. I don\u2019t really need to hear that. I took this job assuming they hadn\u2019t changed at all. I heard they got six new Black members, whatever, congrats to them, but not why I\u2019m here.\n\nI\u2019m here truly because of all of you. I look out into this room and I see a lot of talented people \u2014 like, people that I admire, people that I would like to be like, and people that I\u2019m jealous of and people that are really incredible artists. And regardless of whatever the Hollywood Foreign Press Association\u2019s past may be, this is an evening where we get to celebrate. And I think this industry deserves evenings like these. I\u2019m happy you all are here. And we\u2019ll have some fun tonight.",

(\u201cIt was wonderful.\u201d) She enjoyed being on set so much, she said, she was sad that her 18th birthday fell on a day off.\n\nBorn in Nottingham, England, Ramsey grew up in the nearby county of Leicestershire. She was 3 when she followed her sister into an amateur theater group, and she never looked back, spending much of her childhood in after-school drama clubs. At 10, she joined the Television Workshop in Nottingham, which counts the actors Samantha Morton and Jack O\u2019Connell among its alumni. Iain Smith, a former workshop director, remembered Ramsey\u2019s standout performance in a production the school staged, playing a teacher who turns into a cow. \u201cShe was stratospheric in terms of her commitment to it,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cIt was uncanny.\u201d Ramsey\u2019s efforts at the workshop led to the audition for \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Her Lyanna Mormont, who joined the show in Season 6, became an instant fan favorite, with a grit and intensity that belied the character\u2019s (and the actor\u2019s) tender age. This commitment is a quality Ramsey still possesses, according to Joe Alwyn, who starred alongside her in the medieval period comedy \u201cCatherine Called Birdy.\u201d In an email, Alwyn wrote that Ramsey, who played the headstrong title character, was \u201cfull of a childlike energy and a willingness to jump in and play, whilst also carrying a maturity and awareness way beyond her years.\u201d Last month, \u201cCatherine Called Birdy\u201d earned Ramsey a Critics Choice Award nomination for best young actor/actress. (The awards will be handed out on Sunday night.) The non-gender-specific category was pleasing for a person who has long reckoned with gender identity \u2014 as a child, Ramsey loved being mistaken for a boy by strangers, she said.\n\nNow, if she sees \u201cnonbinary\u201d as an option on a form, she will tick it. \u201cI\u2019m very much just a person,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing gendered isn\u2019t something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Ramsey has used her art to help her process other aspects of her life. She returned recently to a film script she began when she was 14, a project inspired partly by her own experience with anorexia nervosa. (In 2018, Ramsey posted on social media about her diagnosis and the part religion played in her recovery, though her relationship with faith is \u201ca lot quieter\u201d today, she said.) The script, which has \u201cdeveloped and matured\u201d over the past five years, she said, is about a teenage girl living with an eating disorder and the \u201cimperfect relationships and complicated people\u201d she surrounds herself with. Ramsey asked some past collaborators to read an early draft, and one person who did was the Oscar-nominated actor and filmmaker Jesse Eisenberg, a co-star in the 2020 war drama \u201cResistance.\u201d In a phone interview, Eisenberg said the script was \u201cinsightful and written with great emotional depth.\u201d What strikes him about Ramsey, he said, is that she exhibits \u201cher generation\u2019s thoughtfulness, but on the other hand she seems to have this amazing self awareness too.\u201d \u201cBella is like a Rosetta stone for young people,\u201d he added. Ramsey has never been much of a gamer, but she was aware of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d when her agent emailed an audition script and Ellie\u2019s character description. She was immediately drawn to the role, she said, and felt attached to Ellie \u201cfor reasons I couldn\u2019t describe.\u201d After Ramsey won the part, Druckmann and Mazin advised her not to play the game in order to prepare. Instead, the actor watched YouTube clips of significant gameplay scenes, she said, in order \u201cto feel confident that the Ellie I felt inside of me, under my skin, was the right one.\u201d\n\nIn the lead up to the release of \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d Ramsey has found life \u201chectic in ways that I\u2019m not used to,\u201d she said. But it is a welcome change after the break she has taken from filming since the shoot wrapped in June, her longest since she was 11. \u201cI don\u2019t know what relaxing is, and I\u2019ve never been very good at it,\u201d she said. She has filled the time studying environmental science as part of a university distance-learning course and preparing for her driving test. She plans to eventually leave Leicestershire and move to London. It is all part of an arc toward independence that the former child actor, now an adult, said she is still getting used to. \u201cThere was a time I was so anxious I couldn\u2019t leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now knowing one day I could live by myself is exciting to me.\u201d Making \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d was part of this process, Ramsey said: \u201cI feel like my world has just expanded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a specific combination of contradictions: Someone that can be funny and quirky, and violent and rough,\u201d Druckmann, who also led development of the game, said in a phone interview.

The non-gender-specific category was pleasing for a person who has long reckoned with gender identity \u2014 as a child, Ramsey loved being mistaken for a boy by strangers, she said.\n\nNow, if she sees \u201cnonbinary\u201d as an option on a form, she will tick it. \u201cI\u2019m very much just a person,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing gendered isn\u2019t something that I particularly like, but in terms of pronouns, I really couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Ramsey has used her art to help her process other aspects of her life. She returned recently to a film script she began when she was 14, a project inspired partly by her own experience with anorexia nervosa. (In 2018, Ramsey posted on social media about her diagnosis and the part religion played in her recovery, though her relationship with faith is \u201ca lot quieter\u201d today, she said.) The script, which has \u201cdeveloped and matured\u201d over the past five years, she said, is about a teenage girl living with an eating disorder and the \u201cimperfect relationships and complicated people\u201d she surrounds herself with. Ramsey asked some past collaborators to read an early draft, and one person who did was the Oscar-nominated actor and filmmaker Jesse Eisenberg, a co-star in the 2020 war drama \u201cResistance.\u201d In a phone interview, Eisenberg said the script was \u201cinsightful and written with great emotional depth.\u201d What strikes him about Ramsey, he said, is that she exhibits \u201cher generation\u2019s thoughtfulness, but on the other hand she seems to have this amazing self awareness too.\u201d \u201cBella is like a Rosetta stone for young people,\u201d he added. Ramsey has never been much of a gamer, but she was aware of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d when her agent emailed an audition script and Ellie\u2019s character description. She was immediately drawn to the role, she said, and felt attached to Ellie \u201cfor reasons I couldn\u2019t describe.\u201d After Ramsey won the part, Druckmann and Mazin advised her not to play the game in order to prepare. Instead, the actor watched YouTube clips of significant gameplay scenes, she said, in order \u201cto feel confident that the Ellie I felt inside of me, under my skin, was the right one.\u201d\n\nIn the lead up to the release of \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d Ramsey has found life \u201chectic in ways that I\u2019m not used to,\u201d she said. But it is a welcome change after the break she has taken from filming since the shoot wrapped in June, her longest since she was 11. \u201cI don\u2019t know what relaxing is, and I\u2019ve never been very good at it,\u201d she said. She has filled the time studying environmental science as part of a university distance-learning course and preparing for her driving test. She plans to eventually leave Leicestershire and move to London. It is all part of an arc toward independence that the former child actor, now an adult, said she is still getting used to. \u201cThere was a time I was so anxious I couldn\u2019t leave the house,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now knowing one day I could live by myself is exciting to me.\u201d Making \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d was part of this process, Ramsey said: \u201cI feel like my world has just expanded.\u201d",

            "content": "The first banana bread that shocked me into awareness was baked in New Orleans. I was flirting with a barista, and after we bored ourselves to tears, he offered me a slice across the counter. I grew up with the dish \u2014 which made it perennially uninteresting \u2014 but he insisted that this one was different. And he was entirely right. The loaf tasted sweet without being overbearing. Its crumble melted across the tongue. That bite made me more present. For the next few months, I bought a slice weekly until I moved, still chewing on a slice as my flight crossed the Louisiana state line.\n\nBanana bread is both striking and unremarkable, simple and staggering, found on the counters of coffee shops and apartment bar tops and tiny cafes globally. A corner piece can shift your entire day. Or maybe your tea is a slice from the middle, full of flavor without the baggage of a crust. Or perhaps your ideal banana bread is whichever iteration is available \u2014 YouTube\u2019s code sags under the weight of banana-bread recipes, and they\u2019re each as delicious as the impulses behind them. It\u2019s a dish as perfect as it is malleable.\n\nThe origins of banana bread are pretty remarkable. Bananas aren\u2019t indigenous to the Americas, and it wasn\u2019t until the 19th century that they were available in the United States. The predicament of transporting a fruit that rotted so quickly was difficult to parse until the widespread availability of refrigeration methods around the turn of the 20th century. As the Great Depression rolled through, every article of food became a necessity; the humble banana\u2019s status as a breakfast curiosity folded into recipes intent on maximizing its possibilities. Alongside the eventual widespread availability of chemical leaveners, like baking powder and baking soda, the impetus and the possibility for variation upon variation of banana bread were catalyzed: How could bare necessities be made beautiful? Which flavor portraits could be painted through primary colors?",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA highly contagious version of the Omicron variant \u2014 known officially as XBB.1.5 or by its subvariant nickname, Kraken \u2014 is quickly spreading in the U.S. The young subvariant was first detected in New York State in the fall. It currently makes up about 28 percent of cases in the U.S. and about 72 percent of cases in the Northeast, according to the C.D.C. It\u2019s a highly mutated version of the virus that appears able to better evade immune defenses and invade cells, with some experts calling it the most transmissible variant yet. Scientists say it remains rare in much of the world, but they expect it to spread quickly and globally. To understand more, I spoke to my colleague Carl Zimmer, a science reporter who covers the coronavirus. \u200b\u200bWhat should we know about XBB.1.5? It looks like XBB.1.5 is a cut above the other Omicron subvariants in terms of getting around our defenses, and it\u2019s also a very transmissible virus. We won\u2019t know the full XBB.1.5 story until it\u2019s over, but right now it\u2019s definitely looking like it could potentially become dominant in the United States, maybe even the world.\n\nIs it more deadly than other variants? Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot of data on its effects. From what I\u2019ve heard from experts, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s any more severe, which is good. But it takes time for a variant to become common enough that it infects people in large numbers, and then for some of those people to end up in the hospital, and then to analyze all those numbers. It\u2019s really surging here in the northeastern U.S., but we don\u2019t have great medical information systems to get quick answers on that. Where did XBB.1.5 come from? XBB.1.5 descends from something called XBB. And XBB is a very unusual form of Covid. It may have emerged in the spring or summer last year, possibly in India. What\u2019s unusual about XBB is that it was the product of two different forms of Omicron that both infected someone. As they were replicating inside that person, their genes were mixed together, and then we got a new hybrid. And this hybrid is very good at evading defenses from vaccines and infections. More on the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\u2022 None A Better Covid Winter: Some of the worst days of Covid in the United States have come as winters have settled in. But Some of the worst days of Covid in the United States have come as winters have settled in. But a surge in hospitalizations has yet to materialize this season\n\u2022 None New Subvariant: A highly contagious version of the Omicron variant \u2014 known officially as XBB.1.5 or by its subvariant nickname, Kraken \u2014 A highly contagious version of the Omicron variant \u2014 known officially as XBB.1.5 or by its subvariant nickname, Kraken \u2014 is quickly spreading in the United States\n\u2022 None Pfizer\u2019s Boosters: Federal officials said that fears that the Covid booster shots made by Pfizer may increase the risk of strokes in people aged 65 and older Federal officials said that fears that the Covid booster shots made by Pfizer may increase the risk of strokes in people aged 65 and older were not borne out by an intensive scientific investigation So it caused a big surge in Singapore in the fall, but it didn\u2019t really become that common elsewhere because it was competing with so many other subvariants. But as it multiplied, it started gaining more mutations. So XBB gave rise to XBB.1, and then XBB.1 mutated again into XBB.1.5. And it looks like XBB.1.5 gained a really crucial mutation that helps it grab tightly onto cells, which makes it more transmissible on top of doing a better job of escaping antibodies. So it looks really concerning. And in places like the northeastern U.S., it\u2019s the fastest-growing variant out there. How worried should we be? It depends on how you were before. If you weren\u2019t worried before, you should have been. And you should remain worried. A year ago, the first Omicron subvariant surged to dominance. Since then we have seen an explosion of new forms of Omicron. And they continue to gain mutations that help them to spread. In December, we had really fast-spreading viruses out there, and now we have one that\u2019s even faster. So it\u2019s a good time to take it seriously.\n\nWhat will this do to the course of the pandemic in the U.S.? I\u2019ve been talking to scientists who are watching this really closely, and nobody thinks that we\u2019re looking at something like what we saw a year ago, when Omicron first slammed into the U.S. Back then, we had the record-breaking caseload and record-breaking hospitalizations. It won\u2019t be that bad, but how bad it will be, it\u2019s hard to say. There probably will be a surge. And we\u2019re already dealing with a lot of Covid in the U.S., so it\u2019s a bad time for an even faster-spreading virus to show up. How will this affect the outbreak in China? In China, which experienced a large surge of cases in late 2022, its prospects are hard to predict. One possibility is that once other subvariants sweep through China, it will be XBB.1.5\u2019s turn to reinfect some people there. How protective are the new boosters against XBB.1.5? The preliminary studies are, thankfully, looking pretty good. If you\u2019ve been boosted, it looks like it probably reduces your chances of getting infected, and it definitely is good for keeping you out of the hospital, especially if you\u2019re older. Unfortunately, our rates of boosting are not great. Even if you\u2019ve had the two shots of the primary vaccination, you\u2019re still quite vulnerable. The updated booster can really protect a lot of people. What\u2019s next in the virus\u2019s evolution? Forecasting evolution is harder than forecasting the weather. But what\u2019s interesting is that scientists do have some glimpses into possible futures. The mutations that have produced XBB.1.5 have actually made it easier for this virus to gain the ability to evade more antibodies. It\u2019s become more evolvable, you could say. So an even more evasive form of XBB.1.5 could be showing up soon. Scientists are able to track the evolution of this virus in a way that they were never able to do in previous years with things like influenza or measles. But they still aren\u2019t seeing things exactly in real time. So it\u2019s possible that the next new variant is already here. It\u2019s possible that someone walking around Rhode Island or Connecticut has already incubated the next big thing.\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.

We may appear in your inbox again if the pandemic takes a drastic turn, but at the end of this month, we will pause the Virus Briefing. Personally, it\u2019s bittersweet. For years, I\u2019ve waited for the day when we would happily put this newsletter to rest. In the early days, I thought that moment would come when we reached herd immunity, when we had an effective vaccine or when treatments would render the virus powerless. But over time, I think we realized that we would never experience that total release and that the virus would most likely be with us long term. While we\u2019re certainly in a better place than when this newsletter was created, I had hoped for more closure as it came to an end. Without a doubt, what I will miss most about this experience are the conversations with you.

We recently asked readers about the lingering aftereffects of the pandemic. I am less affected by the virus than my mother is. Ever since the news first came out about a novel virus, she has holed up in her house with boxes of gloves, masks and tests and an endless stream of CNN talking heads. When my wife and I visited, we sat on couches covered in sheets and my mother sat in another room to avoid any risks of exposure. Once we were all vaccinated, her mind eased and she removed the sheets from the couches and we could hug again. Fast-forward to late summer 2022 and my mother became infected. She had some scary side effects that luckily disappeared over a few weeks. While I believed that by finally getting the virus she would be more free from the clutches of living a hermit lifestyle, it made it worse. She barely leaves the house now except to take the trash out and complete her weekly trip to do errands. As her son, I want her to move on. I miss everything about how we were prepandemic.

            "content": "A pair of mating Neotrogla barklice mating. The grip of a female\u2019s penislike gynosome is so secure that attempting to separate a mating pair will tear the male in half.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe penis has a variety of peculiar shapes and sizes: the corkscrewed shaft of a duck, the needlelike organ of a bedbug and the four-headed member of an echidna. No matter how strange they look, these phalluses all help males deliver sperm to fertilize the eggs of their female mates. But some flea-size insects that resemble bleached flies and feast on bat droppings in Brazilian caves reverse these reproductive roles. Female barklice in the Neotrogla genus possess an erectile, penislike structure covered in spines called a gynosome. They use this organ to penetrate the male Neotrogla\u2019s vagina-like cavity. Instead of delivering sperm, the female\u2019s gynosome vacuums it up as she mounts her mate. This role reversal has rarely emerged in nature: Only Neotrogla barklice and a closely related group of insects in southern Africa possess a gynosome. A new effort by researchers to study this penislike structure has revealed the key muscles that help the barklice wield their anatomical anomalies, as reported in a study published Wednesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The perpetually dry cave systems the barklice inhabit in southeastern Brazil are often short on nutrients and moisture. This lack of reliable grub \u201cis probably a major factor facilitating the evolution of sex-role reversals,\u201d said Kazunori Yoshizawa, an entomologist at Hokkaido University in Japan and an author of the study.\n\nIn most animal relationships, males are desperate to mate, investing their energy in gaudy displays or destructive duels to woo partners, while females, who expend great amounts of energy producing eggs, are much choosier. But these females flip that maxim on its head, aggressively pursuing their pickier male counterparts. When bat droppings are scarce, female Neotrogla hanker for sperm, which is encased in nutritious capsules called spermatophores. But virile mates are hard to come by in dark caves, so the female bugs must hold their living sperm banks tight. The gynosome\u2019s prickly spines lock the penislike structure inside the male, keeping him snug during bouts of copulation that can last up to 70 hours. The gynosome\u2019s grip is so secure that attempting to separate a pair of mating Neotrogla will tear the male in half.\n\nOnce inside the male\u2019s vagina-like opening, the gynosome inflates like a curved balloon as it gathers semen, which it deposits in a storage organ. When the storage organ fills up, a special valve in the gynosome diverts more semen into a second storage tank, allowing the female to continue siphoning sperm. Neotrogla are not the only female creatures in nature to brandish penislike structures. Several mammals, including moles and spotted hyenas, have an elongated clitoris dangling between their legs. Female sea horses utilize a protruding egg duct to essentially impregnate the male sea horse with her eggs, which he fertilizes and eventually births.\n\nBut none of these structures is as complex or functional as Neotrogla\u2019s gynosome. Instead of being an extension of an already existing feature, the gynosome is a distinct piece of reproductive hardware, complete with unique muscles and ducts. To understand the gynosome\u2019s internal anatomy, the team utilized micro-CT scanners to create detailed, 3-D renderings of the nether regions of three preserved Neotrogla specimens \u2014 one solitary female and a male-female pair locked in copulation. The scientists also analyzed scans of females from related species of barklice, including some that have primitive, non-protruding \u201cprepenises.\u201d In the study, the team identified two groups of muscles that help female Neotrogla control their penislike gynosomes. One set of muscles was taut in the copulating pair of barklice when the penislike structure was inflated. The other set of muscles, which hooks the gynosome to the female\u2019s internal organs, was active in the flaccid gynosome of the solo Neotrogla specimen. The researchers concluded that these muscle groups helped the females both to unfurl their gynosomes in the lead-up to their prolonged mating sessions and to retract their engorged gynosomes afterward. According to Mercedes Burns, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County who studies arachnid reproduction, these muscles are reminiscent of those of the daddy longlegs. \u201cWhen these interior muscles contract, they allow for the penis to be extruded like a crossbow, and then when they relax, the retractor muscles pull them back in,\u201d said Dr. Burns, who was not involved in the new study. The researchers also found some of these muscles in female relatives of Neotrogla with more primitive sexual gear like prepenises. In those insects, the organ may have a different function, such as stimulating, instead of penetrating the male, Dr. Yoshizawa said. That could mean these muscles predated the evolution of the penislike gynosome. \u201cWe can see where this structure came from and what ecological conditions caused these role reversals,\u201d Dr. Burns said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just alien anymore.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Justice Department is scrutinizing how both presidents came to have classified records after they left office. But there are major differences.\n\nFollow for the latest on the discovery of the second batch of classified documents from Biden\u2019s vice presidency. WASHINGTON \u2014 The disclosure that classified documents were found in a private office that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had used before beginning his 2020 campaign and at his residence in Wilmington, Del., has prompted comparisons to former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s hoarding of sensitive government records, which is the subject of a criminal investigation. Based on what is publicly known so far, here is a closer look: How are the situations similar? At a basic level, both involve official files bearing classification markings that improperly accompanied Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden after they left office. Under the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives and Records Administration once an administration departs. Private citizens generally lack authorization to hold classified documents, and regulations require such files to be stored securely. The Justice Department is scrutinizing both situations. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland has appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to oversee the investigation. In Mr. Biden\u2019s case, Mr. Garland has assigned a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, John R. Lausch Jr., to conduct an initial investigation to help him determine whether to appoint a special counsel.\n\nHow are the situations different? There are key gaps in the public record about both, but the available information suggests there were significant differences in how the documents came to light, their volume and \u2014 most important \u2014 how Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden responded. Mr. Trump and his aides resisted the government\u2019s repeated efforts to retrieve them all. Mr. Biden\u2019s lawyers reported the problem and the White House says it has fully cooperated, including by searching Mr. Biden\u2019s Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Del., houses, \u201cthe other locations where files from his vice-presidential office might have been shipped in the course of the 2017 transition.\u201d These apparent differences have significant legal implications. Where were the files? In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, several hundred government files marked as classified \u2014 along with thousands of unclassified documents and photos \u2014 ended up at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago, after he left office. Some were in cartons in a locked storage closet, and the F.B.I. discovered others in Mr. Trump\u2019s office, including in his desk, according to court filings. In Mr. Biden\u2019s case, the administration said in a statement on Monday that \u201ca small number of documents with classified markings\u201d had been discovered in a locked closet in an office at a Washington think tank, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. It said that Mr. Biden had periodically used the space after leaving the vice presidency in 2017 and before he began his presidential campaign. The discovery at two locations of classified documents from President Biden\u2019s time as vice president has prompted the Justice Department to scrutinize the situation.\n\u2022 None In Washington: Attorney General Merrick B. Garland\u2019s Attorney General Merrick B. Garland\u2019s appointment of a special counsel to investigate the situation drew a mixed reception from Republicans , who had hoped to spearhead the effort themselves.\n\u2022 None Two Cases in the Spotlight: Two presidents \u2014 Two presidents \u2014 Mr. Biden and former President Donald J. Trump \u2014 are now under investigation by special prosecutors for how they\u2019ve handled classified documents. Here is how their cases compare\n\u2022 None Last Days as Vice President: The appointment of a special counsel has focused new attention on The appointment of a special counsel has focused new attention on the frenetic final stretch of Mr. Biden\u2019s vice presidency in January 2017.\n\u2022 None Presidents and Their Prosecutors: Since the dark days of Watergate, every president but one Since the dark days of Watergate, every president but one has faced a special prosecutor looking into them or their associates. The administration also acknowledged on Thursday that subsequent searches had found \u201ca small number of additional Obama-Biden administration records with classified markings\u201d among personal and political papers at his Wilmington home. Most were found in a storage space in his garage, it said; one page was among stored materials in an adjacent room. How did the files get there? As president, Mr. Trump is said to have periodically taken records from the Oval Office to the residential areas of the White House. During the chaos of his last days in office after he sought to cling to power, those files were apparently packed up with personal items like clothing and mementos and shipped to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIt is not yet known how records from the Obama administration wound up at the Penn Biden Center and Mr. Biden\u2019s house, apparently during the 2017 transition. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden said that he took classified information seriously and that he was \u201csurprised to learn that there were any government records there that were taken to that office.\u201d How did the problems come to light? In the case of Mr. Trump, the National Archives realized in the spring of 2021 that historically prominent files were missing and asked Mr. Trump to return them. The agency eventually retrieved 15 boxes and found that they included documents with classification markings. The Justice Department retrieved additional records after issuing a subpoena, but it developed evidence that Mr. Trump still had more. In the case of Mr. Biden, the White House has said that his lawyers discovered the files on Nov. 2 when they were packing up to vacate the office at the Penn Biden Center. \u201cThe documents were not the subject of any previous request or inquiry by the archives,\u201d it said. The administration said that after the first classified documents were discovered, Mr. Biden\u2019s team searched two other places where materials from his vice-presidential office might have been shipped after the Obama administration departed: his home in Wilmington and another in Rehoboth Beach, Del. None were found in Rehoboth Beach. It did not say when the searches began, but said that the review was completed on Wednesday. How Times reporters cover politics.

How did they respond? Mr. Biden\u2019s team reported the problem to the National Archives on the same day it was discovered, and the agency retrieved the materials the next morning, the administration said. It emphasized that Mr. Biden\u2019s team had since cooperated with the archives and the Justice Department, including by searching his two houses, \u201cto ensure that any Obama-Biden administration records are appropriately in the possession of the archives.\u201d Mr. Biden said on Tuesday that his lawyers had acted appropriately: They immediately called the archives to turn over the materials. \u201cWe\u2019re cooperating fully \u2014 cooperating fully \u2014 with the review, which I hope will be completed soon,\u201d he said. By contrast, Mr. Trump and his aides for months delayed responding to the National Archives\u2019 repeated requests for months, then failed to fully comply with the subpoena while falsely saying they had. A court filing also suggested that security camera footage showed that \u201cgovernment records were likely concealed and removed\u201d from the storage room at Mar-a-Lago after the subpoena.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the National Archives for telling the Justice Department about the matter and portrayed the investigation as illegitimate. A federal judge is considering holding his team in contempt for defying the subpoena. In each case, were the documents still classified? Mr. Trump publicly claimed that before leaving office, he declassified everything that turned up at Mar-a-Lago. No credible evidence has emerged to support that claim, and his lawyers have resisted repeating it in court, where there are professional consequences for lying. (Moreover, the potential crimes cited in the affidavit used to search Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida residence do not depend on whether mishandled documents were classified.) While the executive order governing the classified information system gives vice presidents the same power to declassify secrets as presidents wield, Mr. Biden has not claimed he declassified the materials found in the Penn Biden Center closet. He said on Tuesday that he did not know what they were. How many classified documents were there? Many more classified documents appear to have been improperly stored at Mr. Trump\u2019s estate than at Mr. Biden\u2019s office. Court filings say that 184 documents marked as classified were in the 15 boxes the National Archives initially retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump team turned over 38 more such records after the subpoena, and the F.B.I. found another 103 in its search. The Biden administration\u2019s initial statement said a \u201csmall number\u201d of documents marked as classified had been discovered in the closet at the Penn Biden Center. CBS News has reported there were about 10. The administration\u2019s statement on Thursday about the second batch found at his house in Wilmington similarly described it as \u201ca small number.\u201d Were documents also mutilated or destroyed? Mr. Trump appears to have destroyed official documents. Former aides have said he ripped up files while in office, and a letter from the National Archives indicated that some of the files it retrieved had been mutilated.\n\nThere has been no allegation that Mr. Biden destroyed public records. What are the legal consequences of these differences? The implications of these differences are significant, though more information could still come to light. One question is whether any mishandling of secrets was intentional. A provision of the Espionage Act, for example, makes it a crime if someone, without authorization, willfully retains a national security secret \u201cand fails to deliver it on demand\u201d to an official entitled to take custody of it. Another provision of the act says that a person can be guilty if, through \u201cgross negligence,\u201d he or she permits national security papers to be removed from their proper place of custody. That provision has historically been interpreted in case law and Justice Department practice as requiring a state of mind that is so reckless that it falls just short of being willful. The application to search Mar-a-Lago cited the Espionage Act, as well as laws against destroying official documents and obstructing an official effort. That the F.B.I. discovered additional documents with classification markings in its search of Mar-a-Lago has also raised the possibility that Mr. Trump\u2019s team defied the subpoena and made false statements.",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration halted flights Wednesday morning after a system to alert pilots to safety issues went down, just two weeks after a major Southwest Airlines meltdown.\n\nTens of thousands of flights were delayed or canceled around Christmas when frigid weather and storms made travel treacherous. But the weather was mostly fine on Wednesday morning when flights across the country were halted because the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s system to alert pilots to safety issues went down. The F.A.A. said on Wednesday night that it had traced the outage to a damaged database file and that there was no evidence that it was caused by a cyberattack. The disruption was the latest example of serious problems in the aviation system and at the F.A.A., the agency responsible for safely managing all commercial air traffic that critics say has long been overworked and underfunded. The pause on flights across the country highlighted what aviation experts say are glaring weaknesses at the agency, long considered the world\u2019s premier aviation regulator. The F.A.A. has struggled to quickly update systems and processes, many of which were put in place decades ago, to keep up with technological advancements and a sharp increase in the number of flights and passengers. Problems with the system used to notify pilots of hazards in the air and ground began on Tuesday night, forcing officials to reboot the system early Wednesday morning. To fix the problem, the F.A.A. ordered airlines to delay all departing flights just before 7:30 a.m. That pause was lifted at about 9 a.m., but the disruption was far from over as airlines struggled to get back to normal throughout the day. Delays cascaded throughout the system and, by the afternoon, about 9,000 flights had been delayed and 1,300 had been canceled.\n\nJust two weeks earlier, hundreds of thousands of travelers were stranded by an operational meltdown at Southwest Airlines, the country\u2019s largest carrier by number of passengers. Taken together, the two episodes underscore the fragility of the nation\u2019s aviation system. The F.A.A., in particular, has long faced criticism for failing to modernize its technological systems quickly enough and not hiring enough air traffic controllers and safety specialists. Lawmakers strongly criticized the agency\u2019s oversight of Boeing, for example, after two of the company\u2019s 737 Max planes crashed, killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. A big part of the problem, aviation experts said, is that Congress has not given the F.A.A. enough money to do its many jobs properly, and the agency has sometimes been slow to make change even when it had enough resources. The agency\u2019s budget was about $18.5 billion in 2022 \u2014 less than it was in 2004 after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe outage will surely figure prominently in hearings and debates in Congress because the F.A.A.\u2019s most recent authorization, passed in 2018, expires this year. That gives lawmakers an opportunity to overhaul the agency, require changes and reset its funding. Many senators and representatives have expressed anger and concern about flight delays and cancellations since air travel began to recover in 2021 after collapsing in the first year of the pandemic. What to Know About the Southwest Airlines Chaos Severe winter weather plunged Southwest, a low-cost carrier, into crisis during the holiday season, causing thousands of flights to be canceled.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Crisis: While other carriers bounced back after severe winter weather wreaked havoc on holiday travel, Southwest Airlines struggled.

Last week, President Biden renominated his choice to lead the agency, Phillip A. Washington, the chief executive of Denver International Airport. Mr. Washington was nominated last year but did not receive a Senate confirmation hearing. He has faced criticism over his limited aviation experience and his involvement in a public corruption investigation in Los Angeles, where he previously ran the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Washington has said he did nothing wrong. The agency has lacked a permanent leader since the end of March, when Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, stepped down about halfway through a five-year term. Since then, Billy Nolen, the F.A.A.\u2019s top safety official, has led the agency on an interim basis. A spokeswoman for Ms. Cantwell said her committee had not yet scheduled a hearing to consider Mr. Washington\u2019s nomination. The F.A.A. system that went down on Wednesday sends safety alerts to pilots. Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the F.A.A. as the secretary of transportation, said on Wednesday that the government was investigating what caused the outage and why the agency\u2019s systems were not more resilient. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a problem with a government system, we\u2019re going to own it, we\u2019re going to find it, and we\u2019re going to fix it,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told reporters. \u201cIn this case, we had to make sure that there was complete confidence about the safety of flight operations, which is why there was the conservative but important step to have that pause and make sure everything was back up and running.\u201d Experts say that the F.A.A.\u2019s technology has grown outdated and that the agency has long lacked the resources for ambitious overhauls that would strengthen those systems. \u201cI\u2019ve been flying airplanes for 55 years, it\u2019s been known for a long time that the F.A.A. is often underfunded,\u201d Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the pilot who safely landed a US Airways plane on the Hudson River in 2009, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday as the flight he was traveling on was delayed. Two decades ago Congress did launch a major overhaul of the national aviation system, known as the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen. The multibillion-dollar project, which is intended to allow airlines to operate more flights and modernize some of the aging technology used by the F.A.A., has been mired in problems and taken longer than expected. In a 2021 report, the inspector general of the Transportation Department found that the benefits of the NextGen overhaul have fallen far short of early projections, but said that it still held promise. The project is supposed to help the agency handle increased air traffic and develop technology to prevent problems like Wednesday\u2019s disruption. \u201cThe expectations for these capabilities vastly exceeded the actual deliverables,\u201d said Robert Mann, an airline industry expert and president of the aviation consultancy R.W. Mann and Company. The F.A.A. outage came just two weeks after Southwest Airlines canceled thousands of flights over the Christmas holiday. Jeenah Moon for The New York Times In recent years, the F.A.A. has fallen short in other areas, including not having enough air traffic controllers in some parts of the country at times. The airline industry and a union that represents controllers have said that staffing shortages have led to flight delays and cancellations. Airline executives and union leaders say the air traffic control center in Jacksonville, Fla., in particular has been overwhelmed by flights. That issue has been compounded by bad weather, commercial space launches and other problems, Rich Santa, the president of the union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in a speech last summer. \u201cIf you fly on the East Coast, if you come close to Florida, you are affected by this facility,\u201d he said. The agency launched a broad air traffic controller recruiting campaign last year, but the effort is unlikely to quickly resolve any staffing problems because hiring and training controllers can take months \u2014 and getting new hires to the right places can take even longer. The agency also faced widespread criticism for failing to adequately ensure the safety of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jet after the two crashes. The F.A.A. had outsourced oversight to Boeing itself through a program where some regulatory work was delegated to company employees. That practice was allowed under federal law partly because the agency didn\u2019t have the resources to do the work on its own. Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina, said the outage on Wednesday was particularly frustrating because it happened so soon after Southwest Airlines\u2019 meltdown during the holidays. Ms. Mace said Southwest and federal agencies should face the same tough scrutiny and that she intended to ask the F.A.A. questions about its shortcomings and how it planned to address them. \u201cThe F.A.A. is putting safety first, which is important,\u201d Ms. Mace said. \u201cBut also, at the same time, Americans should know they can take a flight on any random week of the year and know that they\u2019ll get to their destination safely and securely.\u201d\n\u2022 None Stranded and Stuck: The airline\u2019s customers incurred thousands of dollars in expenses The airline\u2019s customers incurred thousands of dollars in expenses as they scrambled to find alternate ways to get home\n\u2022 None A Daunting Task: In an interview, Southwest\u2019s chief executive, Bob Jordan, In an interview,Southwest\u2019s chief executive, Bob Jordan, discussed the challenge of regaining the trust of employees and customers after the meltdown. \u201cWe will be looking into what caused this outage and how redundancy plays a role in preventing future outages,\u201d Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe public needs a resilient air transportation system.\u201d The F.A.A. is also without a permanent leader, and it is not clear when that will change.

The stand-up comedian Jerrod Carmichael hosted the 80th Globes ceremony, foregoing the typical monologue (zingers about high-wattage attendees) for a subdued opening directly addressing the lack of diversity that kept the show off the air last year. In several moments, a quiet awkwardness fell over the room, as when he noted that the group that awards the Globes didn\u2019t \u201chave a single Black member until George Floyd died.\u201d \u201cOne minute, you\u2019re making mint tea at home, the next you\u2019re invited to be the Black face of an embattled white organization,\u201d he continued, explaining how he came to take the gig. \u201cLife really comes at you fast, you know?\u201d He cracked that a friend, upon learning that he would get paid $500,000, told him to \u201cput on a good suit and take them white people\u2019s money.\u201d \u201cThe Fabelmans,\u201d a semi-autobiographical family drama from Steven Spielberg, won the Globe for best film, drama, and the award for best director.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really happy about this,\u201d Spielberg said while accepting the directing prize. \u201cI\u2019ve been hiding from this story since I was 17 years old.\u201d He joked that his mother, Leah Adler, was in heaven \u201ckvelling about this.\u201d \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin,\u201d a windswept tragicomedy about a moldered friendship, was named best film, musical or comedy, also picking up Globes for Martin McDonagh\u2019s screenwriting and Colin Farrell\u2019s acting. But behind the sharp jokes, fervent acceptance speeches, Champagne and couture lurked another sad truth: After two years of upheaval caused by an ethics, finance and diversity scandal \u2014 culminating with NBC\u2019s refusal to broadcast the 2022 ceremony \u2014 Hollywood has dropped any pretense that the Globes are meaningful as markers of artistic excellence. The Globes are about business, plain and simple. Most movie studios view the Globes telecast and accompanying red carpet spectacle as crucial marketing opportunities for winter films, especially dramas, which have been struggling at the box office. In a study released in 2021, economists at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania found that, on average, films that win Globes earn an additional $16.5 million in ticket sales.\n\nJames Cameron, a best director nominee for \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d had received the memo. He turned a red carpet moment into a sales pitch. \u201cWe\u2019re back to theaters \u2014 as a society we really need this,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough with the streaming already!\u201d The lead acting Globes for dramas went to Austin Butler (\u201cElvis\u201d) and Cate Blanchett (\u201cT\u00e1r\u201d). Ke Huy Quan was honored for his supporting performance in \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d while Angela Bassett won the Globe for best supporting actress for her regal role in \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.\u201d In a surprise, HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoff \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d won the Globe for best television drama. (Awards prognosticators had predicted that \u201cSeverance\u201d on Apple TV+ would get the prize.) \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d the ABC comedy set in a Philadelphia school, was named best comedy. \u201cThank you for believing in this show,\u201d Quinta Brunson, the \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star and producer, said earlier as she collected the trophy for best actress in a comedy. \u201cIt has resonated with the world in a way that I couldn\u2019t even imagine it would have.\u201d \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d and \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d had the most nominations going into the night among movies and TV shows. \u201cBanshees\u201d was up for eight film prizes, while \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d figured into five TV categories.\n\nFarrell won the Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical for his baffled \u201cBanshees\u201d performance, taking time to thank studio executives, his co-stars, his family and the donkey that appeared in the film. Michelle Yeoh won best actress in a comedy or musical for \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d a zany twist on superhero movies. \u201cI think all of you women understand this \u2014 as the days, the years and the numbers get bigger, it seems like opportunities start to get smaller,\u201d Yeoh said, noting that she turned 60 last year and referencing the discrimination she has faced in Hollywood. She then started to say how grateful she was for the role when show producers started playing music to nudge her offstage. \u201cShut up, please,\u201d she said, to cheers, before continuing.\n\nPeople who assist stars behind the scenes (agents, publicists, stylists) will tell you that very few were eager to attend the ceremony, either as nominees or presenters. At least 20 nominees did not attend, including Julia Roberts, Blanchett and Zendaya, who was named best actress in a television drama for \u201cEuphoria.\u201d Some of the no-shows cited work conflicts, but the weather didn\u2019t help, with the event coming on the heels of what meteorologists said was the worst rainstorm to sweep through Los Angeles since 2005. Still, most nominees went through the motions \u2014 smiles! smiles! smiles! \u2014 because they care greatly about Oscar nominations, and voting by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences begins on Thursday.\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards broadcast also generates tens of millions of dollars for various Hollywood businesses. Catering companies, party planners, chauffeurs, banquet workers, florists and spray tanners count on the show to generate a significant part of their winter income. \u201cThis is so exciting,\u201d Marc Malkin, a senior Variety editor, said at the start of Variety\u2019s red carpet preshow, sounding like he was still trying to convince himself. (Globes producers actually put down a gray carpet for stars to walk, explaining that it was part of a \u201cnew palette.\u201d Some of the biggest stars walked the carpet but did not give interviews, perhaps to avoid awkward questions about why they decided to come.) Advertisers bought roughly $50.3 million worth of airtime during NBC\u2019s most recent Globes telecast, according to Kantar, a media research firm. NBC paid about $40 million for rights to this year\u2019s show, money that went to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the unorthodox nonprofit organization that bestows the Globes, and Dick Clark Productions, which mounted the telecast. As host, Carmichael veered from serious to lighthearted to boorish (vulgar language, a Whitney Houston joke) during a ceremony that was notable for the diversity of winners and those in contention. The show even made time for a taped message about freedom by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Eddie Murphy and the television producer Ryan Murphy (\u201cPose,\u201d \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\u201d) received lifetime achievement awards. Growing up gay in Indiana, Ryan Murphy said, \u201cI never saw a person like me getting an award or even being a character on a TV show.\u201d\n\nNBC canceled the 2022 telecast amid an ethics, finance and diversity scandal involving the foreign press association. Citing extensive reforms by the group, NBC in September agreed to return the ceremony to its air \u2014 under a one-year trial. The press association has overhauled membership eligibility, recruited new members with an emphasis on diversity, enacted a stricter code of conduct and has moved to end its tax-exempt status and transform into a for-profit company with a philanthropic arm. The 96-member organization now has six Black members \u2014 up from zero \u2014 and has added 103 nonmember voters, a dozen or so of whom are Black. NBC billed the 2023 Globes as \u201cthe party of the year\u201d in advertisements. In truth, however, Hollywood tried to pare back the glamour and excess, in part to send a signal \u2014 the Globes are still on probation \u2014 and in part because studios have been cutting costs and laying off staff to cope with setbacks at their streaming businesses. In the past, the Beverly Hilton has hosted as many as six separate after parties; this time around, there was one scheduled. Even so, the movie capital does not do austerity terribly well. Mo\u00ebt & Chandon was expected to supply more than 100 cases of Champagne, including its Ros\u00e9 Imp\u00e9rial. Globes attendees were served Icelandic salmon with \u201ccitrus-scented celery pur\u00e9e, Maya Pura honey brul\u00e9e, roasted watermelon radish\u201d and \u201cherb dust.\u201d",

            "content": "When you use a gas stove, it emits poisonous gases called nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, a respiratory irritant thought to trigger asthma (cars, boats and other machines also release these gases). A study published last year found that families who use gas stoves in homes with poor ventilation, or without range hoods, can blow past the national standard for safe hourly outdoor exposure to nitrogen oxides within just a few minutes; there are no agreed upon standards for nitrogen oxides in indoor air. Rates of nitrogen oxide emission levels were in direct proportion to the amount of gas the stove was burning, said Eric Lebel, a senior scientist at P.S.E. Healthy Energy, a nonprofit science and policy research institute focusing on energy and the environment, and the lead author on the study.\n\nMs. Seals co-authored a paper published in December that found that gas-burning stoves may be linked to nearly 13 percent of childhood cases of asthma in the U.S. Past research shows that gas stoves led to more exacerbated asthma symptoms as well, she said.\n\nThere\u2019s more data on how gas stoves affect children than there is on how they affect adults, but Ms. Seals said findings suggest that adults with asthma may also be susceptible to worsened symptoms. Children and adults with chronic respiratory conditions are most at risk of negative health effects linked to gas stoves, added Dr. William Checkley, an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nIn addition to asthma, there are other health dangers associated with gas stoves: Researchers who collected 234 samples of unburned natural gas from 69 homes around Boston found 21 toxic pollutants in the gas, including benzene, a known carcinogen, said Dr. Bernstein, who participated in the study.\n\nExperts say the average person should use caution with gas stoves, but these findings don\u2019t necessarily mean you will get sick. \u201cJust because you have a gas stove doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guaranteed to develop asthma or cancer,\u201d Dr. Lebel said. Some people may consider switching from a gas stove to, say, an induction range when they are in the market for a new appliance. For those with a gas stove currently, there are a few simple ways to mitigate potential health risks.",
