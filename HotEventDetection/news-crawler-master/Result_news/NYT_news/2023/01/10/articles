A 22-year old man who had finally saved up enough to study mechanics. An ice cream vendor returning home after a long day of work. None took part in the demonstrations that have consumed Peru for a month. But all were killed in southern Peru on Monday, casualties in what became the deadliest day of clashes between protesters and government forces since the country erupted in violence last month. In a matter of hours, at least 17 civilians and one police officer were killed in the chaos of demonstrations, according to the country\u2019s ombudsman office, an extraordinary spasm of violence that complicated the new president\u2019s attempt to stabilize the country. The killings, in the city of Juliaca, near the border with Bolivia, drew widespread condemnation of Peruvian security forces, which appear to be responsible for most of the deaths, and have been accused by protesters and human rights groups of using lethal force indiscriminately against civilians.\n\n\u201cHe was in uniform, like all the doctors, so that they would be recognized and not attacked,\u201d said Milagros Samillan, 27, the sister of the dead medical resident, an aspiring neurosurgeon named Marco Samillan, 31. \u201cBut the police still attacked them to kill.\u201d Marco Samillan, 31, a medical student killed in the protests in Juliaca, Peru. On Tuesday, Jennie Dador, executive secretary of the National Human Rights Coordinator of Peru, an accountability group, blamed \u201cindiscriminate use of force\u201d by state security forces for Monday\u2019s deaths. \u201cWhat happened yesterday was really a massacre,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThese were extrajudicial killings.\u201d Peru, the fifth-most-populous nation in Latin America, has been the scene of violent demonstrations since early December, when the country\u2019s leftist president, Pedro Castillo, who had promised to address longstanding issues of poverty and inequality, attempted to dissolve Congress and rule by decree. The move was widely condemned as unconstitutional and Mr. Castillo was arrested and replaced by his vice president. Supporters of Mr. Castillo, many of them living in impoverished rural regions, quickly took to the streets to demand new general elections, with many claiming they had been stripped of the right to be governed by the man they had voted into office just one year earlier.\n\nThe violence in Juliaca on Monday marked the deadliest single clash between civilians and armed actors in Peru in at least two decades, when the country emerged from a dictatorship as well as from a long and brutal fight with a violent guerrilla group, a conflict that left at least 70,000 people dead, many of them civilians. The political convulsion in Peru come as South America faces significant threats to many of its young democracies, with polls showing exceptionally low levels of trust in government institutions, politicians and the media. On Sunday, supporters of Brazil\u2019s former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed Congress and other buildings in the capital, fueled by a belief that the election Mr. Bolsonaro lost in October had been rigged. And in nearby Bolivia, protests have erupted in the economic hub of Santa Cruz following the arrest of the opposition governor, whose supporters claim he is being persecuted by the ruling government. Peru\u2019s interior minister, Victor Rojas, said that the protests in Juliaca had begun peacefully on Monday but turned violent around 3 p.m., when about 9,000 protesters tried to take control of the local airport and people armed with makeshift guns and explosives attacked police officers.\n\nThe clashes in Juliaca raise the death toll since Mr. Castillo\u2019s ouster to at least 47 people, according to the nation\u2019s ombudsman. Nearly all of the dead have been civilians, the office said, with 39 killed, along with one police officer, amid protests and seven killed in traffic accidents related to the unrest or as a result of protesters\u2019 blockades. The country\u2019s demonstrations began shortly after authorities arrested Mr. Castillo on charges of rebellion on Dec. 7. Over the last month, some protests have been peaceful; in other cases marchers have used slingshots to fling rocks, set up roadblocks on vital highways, burned government buildings and taken over airports. When the new president, Dina Boluarte, a former ally of Mr. Castillo\u2019s, declared a state of emergency in December, the military took to the streets to maintain order. Hundreds of police officers and civilians have been injured.\n\nThe most recent bloodshed occurred in the region of Puno, a heavily Indigenous part of Peru, after villagers from remote Aymara communities arrived by the thousands in the city of Juliaca. Many were calling for Mr. Castillo to be returned to office, a political nonstarter in the capital of Lima, and a move that would be illegal. The chief demand is new general elections, which the electoral authorities said could happen as early as late this year. Congress has rejected such a tight time frame, with many representatives reluctant to give up their seats, but has backed a proposal for a vote in April 2024.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Boluarte still had not commented on the unrest since confirming the first civilian killed a day earlier, when she sounded exasperated with protesters\u2019 demands. \u201cThe only thing in my hands is bringing forward elections \u2014 and we\u2019ve already proposed it,\u201d Ms. Boluarte said at an event on Monday. \u201cDuring peace, anything can be achieved, but amid violence and chaos it gets harder.\u201d Prime Minister Alberto Ot\u00e1rola, at a news conference, blamed Mr. Castillo and his allies for the deaths of the protesters, saying that they had incited violent attacks meant to destabilize Ms. Boluarte\u2019s government. \u201cThey are who is responsible,\u201d he said, \u201cnot our police, and not citizens who have been terrorized to see how these hordes of criminals try to undermine our rights.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Ot\u00e1rola said the region of Puno would be subject to three days of curfew beginning at 8 p.m.\n\nThe United States, which has repeatedly expressed support for Ms. Boluarte\u2019s government and last week announced $8 million in new funding for Peru to support efforts to fight drug trafficking, was less direct. \u201cIt is urgent that measures are taken to stop this painful situation of violence and avoid the loss of more human lives,\u201d the U.S. ambassador to Peru, Lisa Kenna, wrote on Twitter. After the first nine bodies arrived at a hospital in Juliaca on Monday afternoon, Dr. Enrique Sotomayor, a hospital official, told local media that all had been shot with projectiles from firearms strong enough to seriously damage internal organs. Mr. Samillan, the aspiring neurosurgeon, hoped to one day open a hospital that would serve people with few economic resources, his sister said. He was completing an internship at a hospital in Juliaca, and on Monday, he and other volunteers had gone to the streets to help wounded protesters, she said. Speaking on the phone as she stood in a courtyard outside the hospital morgue, Ms. Samillan said her brother had been shot twice. \u201cEverything was so fast, so bloody that even now I can\u2019t believe everything that\u2019s happening,\u201d she said.\n\nShe called for the resignation of Ms. Boluarte. \u201cThe people don\u2019t want her,\u201d she said. Roger Cayo, 22, always wanted to study mechanics, but he couldn\u2019t afford it, said his only brother, Mauro Cayo. This year he had finally saved up enough money to go. Those plans were dashed when he was shot in the head on Monday while passing by the protests. \u201cRight now we are all mourners here,\u201d said Mr. Cayo, who was waiting to collect his brother\u2019s body. On the phone, the sound of crying was audible in the background. Gabriel Omar L\u00f3pez, 35, was the first person reported dead by the police on Monday. His wife told a newspaper, La Rep\u00fablica, that he had been shot amid the chaos after a day selling ice cream in the streets. On Tuesday, the police identified the dead officer as Jos\u00e9 Luis Soncco, and the Interior Ministry said he had died after protesters attacked a police vehicle, seized weapons and set the vehicle on fire. Protesters have vowed to march to Lima in the coming days, while the government has promised to introduce new measures to restore order. Many Peruvians fear a fresh wave of violence. The government said a delegation of high-ranking officials was being deployed to Puno to establish dialogue. But it was unclear whom they would speak with. On Monday, the interior minister, Mr. Rojas, said he was unable to find anyone in Puno willing to talk with him.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe victim, GuiYing Ma, was a grandmother who had come to New York to support her son and his family. She lingered in a hospital for three months.\n\nA man who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the fatal bludgeoning of a Chinese immigrant as she swept a Queens sidewalk was sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in prison. Elisaul Perez, 33, appeared in Queens County Criminal Court in a tan long-sleeve sweatshirt and green pants, with a lone supporter greeting him with a wave as he entered. Mr. Perez sat looking down during the hearing, speaking through an interpreter only to say that he did not have any comments. The victim, GuiYing Ma, 61, was on a sidewalk in the North Corona neighborhood on the morning of Nov. 26, 2021, when Mr. Perez confronted her, argued with her and then hit her twice in the head with a large rock. Ms. Ma, a grandmother who had moved to New York with her husband in 2017 to seek better-paying jobs to support their son and his family in northeastern China, spent about three months in Elmhurst Hospital before dying.\n\nOn Tuesday, the courtroom was filled with over two dozen people \u2014 friends, supporters, attorneys and reporters. The victim\u2019s husband, Zhanxin Gao, was not there: He has returned to China. Instead, Jennifer Wu, a pro bono attorney who has worked with his family, read a statement from him.\n\nMr. Gao told the court that he was grateful for the community of friends and lawmakers that helped him after his wife\u2019s attack, but that his family is \u201cstill overwhelmed in grief.\u201d \u201cIt was all too sudden that our life in New York City came to an end,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI still can\u2019t accept the sudden death of my wife. I\u2019ve seen violent attacks on old people in the news, but I was overwhelmed when it really happened to me.\u201d Mr. Gao has been struggling with guilt that he was not able to reunite his wife with their son and her mother, said a friend and the couple\u2019s former landlord, Yihung Hsieh, in a statement during the hearing. \u201cThe tragedy that happened to Ms. Ma hit him very hard,\u201d Mr. Hsieh said. Michael Yavinsky, the Queens Supreme Court judge overseeing the case, called it \u201ca tragedy for everyone involved\u201d before announcing Mr. Perez\u2019s sentence, which also includes five years of post-prison supervision.\n\nThe attack came amid a wave of attacks on people of Asian descent in New York City: Michelle Alyssa Go was pushed to her death by a mentally ill man at the Times Square subway station in January. The following month, Christina Yuna Lee was fatally stabbed more than 40 times by a man who followed her from the street into her apartment. \u201cThis case struck a chord because it was so relatable,\u201d said Ms. Wu, the lawyer, before the sentencing. \u201cIt was a woman who got up in the morning the day after Thanksgiving to sweep a porch, to clean up for the community, and she was brutally attacked.\u201d Mr. Perez was captured on surveillance video picking up a large rock and striking Ms. Ma in the head once, according to prosecutors. Once she fell to the ground, he struck her again, they said. He was arrested near the scene and told a police officer what he had done, according to court documents. Mr. Perez, of Brooklyn, was initially charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon. After Ms. Ma\u2019s death, his charges were upgraded to second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter last month. The Queens district attorney\u2019s office said last month that the judge had indicated he would sentence Mr. Perez to 20 years in prison. \u201cTwenty years will serve justice and also send a message,\u201d said the Queens district attorney, Melinda Katz, after the sentencing. In his statement, Mr. Gao asked the judge to sentence Mr. Perez to the maximum. \u201cI still can\u2019t forget my wife, and I miss her more in every holiday season,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen we hold family reunions, our children usually cry before they have meals, because they also miss their mother or grandmother.\u201d",

            "description": "How Brazil\u2019s riots compare to the Jan. 6 attack.",
            "section": "Briefing",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe riots in Brazil on Sunday had echoes of the Jan. 6 attack: Protesters stormed government buildings in the capital. Outnumbered police officers fired what appeared to be pepper spray and tear-gas canisters. The demonstrators persisted for hours, lashing out at what they falsely claim was a stolen election. The comparison is inevitable, and it\u2019s useful in some ways to make sense of what has happened in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s two most populous democracies. But there are major differences between the Jan. 6 attack and Brazil\u2019s riots. In today\u2019s newsletter, I want to help you understand both the similarities and the differences. The resemblance between the Jan. 6 attack and the Brazil riots is clear: In both, a right-wing leader \u2014 Donald Trump in the U.S., Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil \u2014 suggested for months that if they lost a coming election, it would be rigged. Then, when they lost, their supporters embraced the claims, using violence to try to overturn the voting results. \u201cWithout question, Bolsonaro looms over it all,\u201d said my colleague Jack Nicas, the Brazil bureau chief for The Times. \u201cIt is similar to what Trump did in some ways.\u201d\n\nBoth uprisings showed how political leaders can manipulate their supporters into threatening democracy, often for personal gain. Many of their supporters even believed they were acting to defend democracy, when in reality they were working against it. The events also demonstrate the fragility of democracy. As I\u2019ve written in this newsletter before, the world has been in a democratic recession for years: The share of the world\u2019s population living in truly free democracies has declined. The Jan. 6 and Brazil riots fit into that broader trend.\n\nStill, there are major contrasts between Brazil\u2019s riots and the Jan. 6 attack. Unlike Trump, Bolsonaro largely abandoned his claims of fraud after he lost a runoff election; he allowed a peaceful transition to the presidency of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated on Jan. 1. Bolsonaro has also criticized violence, condemning the riots and describing a recent foiled bomb plot by one of his supporters as a \u201cterrorist act.\u201d Unlike American lawmakers on Jan. 6, Brazil\u2019s Congress was not in session during the riots on Sunday. So in contrast to the Trump supporters who had sought to disrupt Congress\u2019s certification of President Biden\u2019s election, the Brazilians destroyed and looted mostly empty buildings, with no official process to interfere with.\n\n\u201cIt was an expression of frustration and outrage,\u201d said Jennifer McCoy, a political scientist at Georgia State University. \u201cBut without the possibility of stopping anything, because the inauguration already happened.\u201d Thousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Mass Attack: After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. Here is what went wrong\n\u2022 None The Investigations: Authorities face Authorities face several major questions as they piece together how rioters briefly seized the seats of Brazil\u2019s government.\n\u2022 None Digital Playbook: Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Many are drawing a comparison to the Jan. 6 attack\n\u2022 None The Role of the Police: Their early inaction in the riot shows Their early inaction in the riot shows how security forces can help empower violence and deepen the threat to democracy. Altogether, the circumstances make Brazil\u2019s riots look more like a tantrum than a Jan. 6-style attack, my colleague Max Fisher wrote. So why did Bolsonaro back off his claims of election fraud? He may have realized that he lacked the institutional support to pull off a coup. The Brazilian military has resisted his supporters\u2019 demands that it intervene in his favor. The army even helped clear the rioters. Another possible explanation: Although Bolsonaro lost, his party won seats in the legislature. That gives Bolsonaro, whose three sons are also elected officials, a personal reason to not cast doubts on the election results. It also makes the election fraud claims harder to buy. Why would Bolsonaro\u2019s opponents rig the election for president but not do the same for the legislature? A similar question could be raised for the 2020 U.S. elections, when Democrats won the presidency but lost seats in the House and only barely clinched the Senate with later runoff elections. As was true in the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, it\u2019s unclear what happens next in Brazil. Brazilian authorities have moved to clear protesters, including at a tent city, in Bras\u00edlia. More than 1,200 people were detained for questioning, a police spokesman said yesterday, as officials investigate how security forces failed to protect the government.\n\nBut such inquiries could lead to further backlash if Bolsonaro supporters come to see the government as conspiring against them. A Supreme Court judge suspended Ibaneis Rocha, the governor of the Federal District (where the capital of Bras\u00edlia is), while investigations into security failures continue. That act \u2014 the suspension of a democratically elected leader by an unelected official \u2014 immediately prompted more questions about the functioning of Brazil\u2019s democracy. The uncertainty gets to one of the biggest differences between the Jan. 6 attack and the weekend riots: Brazil\u2019s 38-year-old democracy is much younger and less established than America\u2019s. It has dealt with serious corruption scandals, including one that temporarily landed Lula, who also previously served as president, in prison. With such a shaky foundation, Brazil is potentially more vulnerable to antidemocratic forces.\n\u2022 None What drove the Brazil attacks? Mass delusion rooted in years of conspiracy theories about rigged elections, The Times\u2019s Jack Nicas writes.\n\u2022 None The heads of Brazil\u2019s constitutional powers denounced the riots as \u201cterrorism\u201d and met at the presidential palace.\n\u2022 None Just as with Jan. 6, we don\u2019t know whether Brazil\u2019s riots represent the end of a political movement or the beginning, Vanessa Barbara writes in Times Opinion.\n\u2022 None The House passed rule changes that Kevin McCarthy had offered to far-right Republicans in his struggle to become speaker, making it easier to remove him and harder to raise taxes.\n\u2022 None Biden\u2019s lawyers discovered classified documents in his former office in November, the White House said. The Justice Department is reviewing the matter.\n\u2022 None In a symbolic act, the House voted to rescind I.R.S. funding that Democrats passed to target rich tax evaders. The change won\u2019t become law.\n\u2022 None A special grand jury in Georgia concluded its investigation into election interference by Trump and his allies. It\u2019s unclear whether anyone will face charges.\n\nRome: This skatepark has an incredible view.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nNurses returned to the picket lines on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center, which were functioning with a skeletal staff.\n\nMore than 7,000 nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center returned to the picket lines on Tuesday as New York City\u2019s largest nurse strike in decades continued into a second day. Hundreds of nurses, wearing their bright red union hats and scarves, marched outside both hospitals Tuesday morning to call for improved wages and more nurses to care for patients, chanting, holding signs and blowing air horns. Inside the hospitals, a skeleton staff cared for reduced patient loads. The nurses said they worried that patient care was suffering inside, but that improving patient safety in the long term was one of the main reasons they went on strike. \u201cWe are very hopeful that we will get something settled soon,\u201d said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse on the negotiating committee at Montefiore. \u201cI really want us to go back.\u201d At Montefiore in the Bronx, nurses and management met at the bargaining table for continued talks on Tuesday morning. At Mount Sinai\u2019s main campus on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, talks were stalled as of Tuesday evening, frustrating the nursing union negotiators, who said they wanted to return to the table as soon as possible.\n\nNursing contracts between the New York State Nursing Association and about a dozen private city hospitals expired on Dec. 31. Since then, eight hospitals have come to tentative agreements or ratified them. Talks continue at three hospitals, and two are striking.\n\u2022 None Apple: After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company After complaints that it violated labor law as its workers sought to unionize, the company will conduct an audit of its U.S. labor practices under an agreement with investors.\n\u2022 None N.Y.C. Nurses\u2019 Strike: Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan Nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and Mount Sinai in Manhattan ended a three-day strike after the hospitals agreed to add staffing and improve working conditions.\n\u2022 None Amazon: A federal labor official A federal labor official rejected the company\u2019s attempt to overturn a union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island, removing a key obstacle to contract negotiations between the union and the company.\n\u2022 None Electric Vehicles: In a milestone for the sector, In a milestone for the sector, employees at an E.V. battery plant in Ohio voted to join the United Automobile Workers union, citing pay and safety issues as key reasons. Nurses have been seeking higher wages, as well as assurances that management will regularly assign more nurses to care for patients. While wage demands have largely been met, the striking nurses are seeking more guarantees that they will not regularly be asked to care for more patients than they feel they can safely handle. Nurses on the picket line at Montefiore described overcrowded, understaffed conditions that they hoped a new contract would address. In the medical intensive care unit, the nurse Mary Powell said some of her patients should have one-on-one care, but often she has to attend to two or three patients instead. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just forced to make it work in order to make sure the patient stays alive. It\u2019s a lot of stress.\u201d Negotiations have been going on for four months, Ms. Sheridan-Gonzalez said, but movement toward union demands of enforceable staffing ratios and recruitment bonuses to compete with higher pay at nearby NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital only happened in the last few days.\n\nTo deal with the strike, the hospitals have called in traveling nurses and relied on medical residents and other hospital staff who remained at work. Montefiore has canceled all elective surgeries and procedures, and Mount Sinai has transferred patients to other facilities, including Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai Morningside, where contract agreements were already reached. Still, some patients and staff inside the hospitals described chaotic conditions, while others said the remaining staff were managing to handle the reduced patient load, at least for the moment. Philip Ozuah, the president and chief executive at Montefiore, said in a letter to staff on Monday that he was deeply disappointed by the strike, and blamed the union for walking away from patients. \u201cIn my opinion, this action was totally unnecessary, especially given how close we already were to a final agreement,\u201d he said. That sentiment was met with fury from the striking nurses outside of Montefiore on Tuesday. \u201cWe are disappointed in you,\u201d they shouted, adding that they just wanted the staff they needed to care for patients effectively. At Mount Sinai, management was also highly critical of the nurses\u2019 decision to strike, calling it reckless. Both hospitals are offering the same 19.1 percent increase in wages over three years settled on by all the hospitals that have so far reached agreements, including two other Mount Sinai Health System campuses. At Mount Sinai, the two sides still have not agreed on enforcement language for patient-nurse ratios or increased seniority differentials to match pay at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West, union representatives said. Talks have gone better elsewhere. The union has reached a tentative agreement with the Brooklyn Hospital Center, and ratified agreements at Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West, NewYork-Presbyterian, Maimonides Medical Center, Richmond University Medical Center, Flushing Hospital Medical Center and BronxCare. Negotiations continue with Interfaith Medical Center, Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, all three of which are in Brooklyn.",

Mr. Biden spoke a day after the White House acknowledged that his lawyers had discovered a small cache of Obama-era documents as they packed up his former office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. The Justice Department is reviewing the discovery to determine how to proceed. The revelation has created a political headache for Mr. Biden, who has called former President Donald J. Trump irresponsible for hoarding sensitive documents at his private club and residence in Florida, and a tactical opportunity for Republicans who had been badly divided in the aftermath of the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe White House has stressed that the circumstances are different \u2014 that Mr. Biden had neither been notified that he had official records nor been asked to return them, and his team promptly revealed the discovery to the archives and returned them within a day. Mr. Biden on Tuesday said he takes \u201cclassified documents seriously\u201d and that his team had immediately contacted the National Archives to turn over the materials. \u201cWe\u2019re cooperating fully \u2014 cooperating fully \u2014 with the review,\u201d he said. He also distanced himself from the matter, suggesting that someone else had brought the files there without his knowledge. \u201cAfter I was briefed about the discovery, I was surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken to that office,\u201d he said at news conference in Mexico, where he appeared with Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president of Mexico, and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the documents,\u201d Mr. Biden said. The Justice Department review is aimed at helping Attorney General Merrick B. Garland decide whether to appoint a special counsel, like the one investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to return all of the sensitive documents he kept at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe committee\u2019s new chairman, Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky, said the government had moved aggressively against Mr. Trump for his possession of classified documents, but not Mr. Biden, who he said had \u201crepeatedly kept classified materials in an insecure location for years\u201d but \u201cnever faced a raid.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile, the F.B.I. conducted a raid on former President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence for the same violation,\u201d Mr. Comer said. The circumstances of the two cases are starkly different, however. Unlike Mr. Trump, who resisted months of government requests to return the material stored at Mar-a-Lago and failed to fully comply with a subpoena, Mr. Biden\u2019s team appears to have acted swiftly and in accordance with the law, immediately summoning officials with the National Archives to retrieve the files. The archives then alerted the Justice Department, according to the White House. The episode illustrated Mr. Biden\u2019s difficulty extracting himself from political peril, even when buoyed by events like the Democrats\u2019 unexpectedly strong showing in the 2022 midterm elections. Republicans, eager to move on from the rancor of their recent House leadership fight, hope to spin the Biden documents case into an attack that sustains a protracted congressional investigation that damages Mr. Biden and blunts the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s troubles on the party. Mr. Garland, whose time in office has been defined by his department\u2019s investigations of Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the documents case, assigned the preliminary phase of the inquiry to John R. Lausch Jr., the U.S. attorney in Chicago. The pick was intended to blunt criticism that Mr. Garland was seeking to protect the Democratic president who appointed him. But the inevitable comparison of the Trump documents case with the Biden matter has put new pressure on Mr. Garland, who decided in November to assign both Trump investigations to a special counsel, Jack Smith, to avoid accusations of a political vendetta against the former president. Mr. Biden and Mr. Garland appeared together at a state visit to Mexico when news of the documents broke on Monday, but neither had any comment at the time, and a department spokesman also refused to comment.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Biden\u2019s lawyers found the documents in a locked closet, intermingled with personal papers as they were packing up boxes from the office. Mr. Biden and his aides had used the office from mid-2017 until the start of the 2020 presidential campaign, and the lawyers were preparing to vacate the space, the White House has said. The discovery was not in response to any prior request from the archives, and there was no indication that Mr. Biden or his team resisted efforts to recover any sensitive documents. When Mr. Biden\u2019s lawyers discovered the documents, they immediately cleared the room and stopped looking at the files, according to a person briefed on their account of the incident. As a result, the Biden team does not know how many classified documents had been in the closet and what all of their contents were, according to the person, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive information. The National Archives was required to notify the Justice Department that classified material had been discovered in an unauthorized place, as it did in January 2022 when it found 184 files marked as classified in 15 boxes of materials it retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. In that matter, the Justice Department eventually developed evidence that Mr. Trump was still holding on to numerous other classified materials. It obtained a grand jury subpoena in May, leading his team to provide 38 additional such documents, at which time they falsely said that was all there were. After obtaining further evidence that Mr. Trump was still withholding documents, the F.B.I. obtained a judicial warrant to search Mar-a-Lago and found 103 more, along with thousands of other publicly owned but unclassified documents and photographs. A federal judge is weighing whether to hold Mr. Trump\u2019s team in contempt for defying the May subpoena. Mr. Garland assigned Mr. Lausch, a Trump appointee, to conduct a so-called initial investigation aimed at gathering facts and legal research in the case of Mr. Biden to inform whether it would be appropriate to appoint a special counsel.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe 1966 American musical has opened at a venue that for decades hosted one of the city\u2019s most famous revue troupes.\n\nFor decades, the Lido was one of the glitziest cabarets in Paris, home to extravagant, acrobatic numbers and the Bluebell Girls, a renowned chorus line. Last July, the curtain came down on their feathered headpieces for the final time, and the ensemble was disbanded. Their replacement at the theater this winter? \u201cCabaret\u201d \u2014 the 1966 American musical. On a recent evening, with bejeweled Bluebell outfits still shimmering in window displays by the venue\u2019s entrance, the Lido\u2019s patrons seemed ready for a show. When the Emcee from \u201cCabaret,\u201d directed by Robert Carsen, introduced the musical\u2019s own ensemble, the Kit Kat Girls and Kit Kat Boys, there were eager cheers, but the lack of topless dancing, not to mention the somber Nazi-era plot, may have come as a surprise to some audience members. Yet the Lido\u2019s move from cabaret to \u201cCabaret\u201d is no coincidence. It speaks to a larger shift in Paris, where American-style musicals have been on the rise just as historic revues have struggled to maintain relevance. The pandemic only accelerated the decline of mainstream French cabaret, long a tourist attraction at venues like the Lido and the Moulin Rouge: Without out-of-towners, there simply weren\u2019t enough Parisians interested in nostalgic cancan dances to prop up expensive revues. Add to that the genre\u2019s increasingly outdated objectification of women\u2019s near-naked bodies, and cabaret appeared to have fallen out of step with the times.\n\nThe Lido\u2019s reinvention as a musical theater venue \u2014 under a new owner, the hotel conglomerate Accor, and a somewhat silly new name, Lido2Paris \u2014 is clearly an attempt to lure back local crowds. To mastermind the transition, Accor hired Jean-Luc Choplin, whose tenure at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet from 2006 to 2017 saw a string of successes with English-language musicals, including \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and \u201c42nd Street.\u201d This winter, the Ch\u00e2telet has again been filled to the rafters, this time for a revival of Stephen Mear\u2019s 2016 production of \u201c42nd Street.\u201d And other venues have been listening to the \u201clullaby of Broadway,\u201d as one \u201c42nd Street\u201d number puts it. At the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris, a French-language adaptation of Mel Brooks\u2019s \u201cThe Producers\u201d by the director Alexis Michalik has turned into a runaway hit since its late 2021 premiere, and is currently scheduled to run through April.\n\nWhile performed in different languages \u2014 \u201c42nd Street\u201d is in English \u2014 \u201c42nd Street\u201d and \u201cThe Producers\u201d don\u2019t depart from Broadway habits. \u201c42nd Street\u201d opens with the curtain raising a couple of feet, so all we see are is the ensemble\u2019s legs, tapping away and garnering enthusiastic applause. The storytelling in both productions is bright, with an almost uncanny rendition into French, in \u201cThe Producers,\u201d of the upbeat pace of American-style dialogue. \u201cThe Producers\u201d didn\u2019t please every critic \u2014 the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration blasted its \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d stereotypes \u2014 but as theaters in France struggle to return to prepandemic ticket sales and the cost of living rises, musicals have seemed immune. That includes the French rock opera \u201cStarmania,\u201d recently revived for the first time in decades, but France simply doesn\u2019t have a wide repertoire of musicals to draw on: The genre was long considered minor, and too entertainment-oriented, by French theater makers.\n\nThat leaves Broadway favorites, and specifically the classics \u2014 what\u2019s missing on Paris stages, inexplicably, is more recent musicals, like \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201d Carsen\u2019s \u201cCabaret\u201d isn\u2019t actually the first version of this musical, with its book by Joe Masteroff, music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb, to be seen in Paris this century. A French translation, staged by Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall, was presented at another historical cabaret venue, the Folies Berg\u00e8re, in 2006. But the Lido2Paris\u2019s production, in English with subtitles, is a dry, ominous showstopper. Carsen, a renowned Canadian director, takes full advantage of the venue\u2019s layout: The Lido was designed as a cabaret-restaurant, with tables laid out on three sides of a thrust stage, and the Kit Kat Klub, the Weimar-era Berlin venue around which \u201cCabaret\u201d revolves, is right at home in this atmosphere. Before its revue closed, the Lido offered a high-end dinner service each night. (Over 150 people were laid off as part of Accor\u2019s takeover, from restaurant staff to the permanent ensemble.) Now audience members have to trek to one of two small bars to buy a glass of champagne and nibbles, which left the auditorium feeling a little deserted. The production captures the nihilism of 1929 Berlin and the steady rise of Nazism, which some characters see as little more than a distraction, starting with cabaret performer Sally Bowles (a role made famous by Liza Minnelli, here given restless intensity by Lizzy Connolly). Clifford Bradshaw, a bisexual American writer who has come to Berlin seeking freedom and inspiration, comes to see the growing political threat \u2014 yet fails to convince Sally, despite the love between them. As the sardonic Emcee who presides over both the Kit Kat Klub and the show itself, Sam Buttery is an arresting sight from the opening \u201cWillkommen\u201d \u2014 bald with heavy, dark makeup, at once charismatic and blas\u00e9.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nResidents hope that Jaylen Smith\u2019s youthful energy and sense of purpose can improve the fortunes of Earle, Ark. \u2014 or at least attract a supermarket to the small city.\n\nAn Ailing Arkansas City Elected an 18-Year-Old Mayor to Turn Things Around\n\nEARLE, Ark. \u2014 The shoe factory closed and the supermarket pulled out. So did neighbors whose old homes were now falling apart, overtaken by weeds and trees. Likewise, the best students at Earle High School often left for college and decided their hometown did not have enough to lure them back. Jaylen Smith, 18, could have left, too. Instead, when he graduated from high school last spring he resolved to stay put in Earle, a small city surrounded by farmland in the Arkansas Delta, where his family has lived for generations.\n\nNot only that, but he ran for mayor. And won. \u201cWhy should I have to go somewhere else to be great when I can be great right here in Earle, Arkansas?\u201d Mr. Smith said a few days after his inauguration last week. He was sitting at his new desk in the mayor\u2019s office but never keeping still as he signed papers and alternated between answering a landline and a cellphone that rang constantly.\n\nOver the years, Earle has been defined in large measure by all it has lost; its population has dwindled to roughly 1,800, from well over 3,000 in the 1990s. But the city has been infused with a sense of optimism since Mr. Smith won the mayor\u2019s race in early December and especially since he took charge on Jan. 1. His victory made him one of the youngest African American mayors ever elected in the country \u2014 a point of enormous pride to his family and supporters. And many residents hope that his youthful energy and sense of mission can boost the city\u2019s fortunes \u2014 or, at the very least, attract a supermarket back to Earle. \u201cIt\u2019s an asset because he\u2019s motivated and he has fresh ideas,\u201d said Tyneshia Bohanon, a city councilwoman who came to know Mr. Smith while substitute teaching in Earle\u2019s public schools. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking of others, as he always has. He chose to stay and get his city where he knows it can be.\u201d The supermarket plan was a pillar of Mr. Smith\u2019s campaign, as was building up the Earle Police Department so it can operate 24 hours a day. He also won over voters by talking about patching up streets, tearing down dilapidated buildings and lifting up the community\u2019s morale.\n\n\u201cI figure he needed a chance,\u201d said Etta Poole, who came to Earle from Chicago in 2008 to care for her sick brother and decided to stay. His platform, as straightforward as it seemed, reflected the steep price that those who remained in Earle have had to pay. Among other things, they have contended with a faulty drainage system that leaves neighborhoods swamped after rain, and coffers that have occasionally been so bare that the city has struggled to make payroll. The school district, while outside the mayor\u2019s purview, was taken over by the state in 2017 partly because of mishandled funds.\n\nAchieving his vision would require Mr. Smith to overcome a decline that has decades of momentum. Yet he does not seem all that daunted. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a go-getter,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was in high school, I was always told no, but I always kept pushing it because I knew there was someone that was waiting to tell me yes.\u201d Not everyone was ready to entrust him with leading the city. One of his biggest obstacles as a candidate was persuading skeptics who cited his age and lack of experience, especially since his opponent in the December election was the city\u2019s far more seasoned sanitation and street manager.\n\nBut his supporters argued that they were not asking voters to put their city in the hands of any 18-year-old. This was Jaylen \u2014 the teenager who started wearing suits to school in ninth grade and has gospel music blasting from his computer speakers. He had also become a fixture at City Council meetings and community events. \u201cSometimes, when the City Council members didn\u2019t show up, Jaylen was there,\u201d said Angela Jones, a councilwoman. \u201cHe attends the school board meetings, the water commission meetings,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was young and he was doing this \u2014 who does that? At a young age, he had purpose.\u201d Earle, whose population is largely Black, sits about 28 miles from Memphis amid sprawling fields where cotton and beans are grown. There are churches, a few used car dealerships and little restaurants, like the Glory Grill on the main street with its signature \u201cMercy Burger.\u201d A block from City Hall, Charlie Young, 70, runs the small grocery and convenience store his father opened before he was born. When he was younger, there were several such stores owned by Asian American families like his. \u201cWe outlived everybody,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cNobody wants to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t going to come,\u201d he said. In any case, in his view, Earle did not need one. \u201cWe\u2019ve got everything you can think of that Walmart\u2019s got,\u201d Mr. Young said of the vast inventory in his store, which includes chips, snack cakes and soft drinks, but also T-bone steaks, crab legs and a diverse selection of hair weaves. \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to clean up the city, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Mr. Young said of Mr. Smith. \u201cEverybody\u2019s eyes are on him.\u201d Billy Joe Murray, the retired basketball coach at Earle High School, said that the city was in dire need of improvements. For him, the drainage system was the most pressing issue. \u201cEvery time it rains, I\u2019m underwater,\u201d he said as he swatted away sweat bees on his front porch. \u201cEverybody leaves Earle,\u201d Mr. Murray, 68, said. \u201cPeople want to move up in life, and Earle is probably at its lowest.\u201d He believed in Mr. Smith, though. \u201cI taught his mama, I know his daddy,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cHe may look young, but he\u2019s got his head on right.\u201d Mr. Smith, who has two older brothers and a twin, Jayden, has \u201cbeen old since he was little,\u201d his mother, Sonya Perkins, said. Coach Murray made him the manager of the basketball team at Earle High, and Mr. Smith once had aspirations of becoming a state trooper. But his plans shifted after he became involved in student government.\n\nMr. Smith knew he had detractors who were wary of his youth, said DeAveon Holmes, one of his closest friends from student government. \u201cHe took that as motivation.\u201d As Mr. Smith campaigned, he knocked on the door of nearly every home in Earle. He spent days shadowing mayors in other Arkansas cities, including Little Rock and West Memphis, and scheduled video calls with mayors outside the state, eager to learn what the job actually entailed. \u201cYou have to have the knowledge,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cYou have to have the character. You have to be disciplined.\u201d On New Year\u2019s Day, in a government building in Marion, about 17 miles away from Earle, judges swore in mayors, council members and incoming law enforcement officers from a number of towns. Each received a certificate attesting to the oath they had just taken. But no other municipality had a crowd like Earle\u2019s, with many people wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Mr. Smith\u2019s face. Ms. Jones, the councilwoman now carrying her own certificate, acknowledged the tough work ahead but also savored what felt like a victory for more than Mr. Smith alone. \u201cHe has an opportunity to show the world what our young Black men are capable of,\u201d she said.\n\nHe has imagined running some day for a seat in the State Legislature, or even serving as the governor of Arkansas. For now, though, Mr. Smith\u2019s attention is on Earle and the often tedious work of running a city. A few days in, his calendar was filling with meetings, and he had already dispatched crews to work on storm drains. He also has college to think about, as he balances the job with online classes at Arkansas State University Mid-South. \u201cThere\u2019s this Bible verse that I always use,\u201d Mr. Smith said, paraphrasing a line from the Book of Habakkuk that had propelled his campaign and drove him now as he mapped out a future for himself and his city: \u201cWrite a vision, make it plain.\u201d His landline rang yet again. \u201cMayor\u2019s office,\u201d he said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nVatican officials said they would reopen a cold case that has gripped Italians, spawned countless theories and been the subject of a Netflix documentary series.\n\nROME \u2014 Four decades after the daughter of a Vatican employee vanished from a street in Rome while walking home from a music lesson, a case that has spawned endless theories by a transfixed Italian public is getting a fresh look, a prosecutor said Tuesday. The Vatican\u2019s top prosecutor, Alessandro Diddi, said his office would try to \u201cgive answers\u201d to the family of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi, who was last seen on June 22, 1983. Although Emanuela\u2019s survivors have pressed the Vatican for years for information, the prosecutor\u2019s sudden decision to look into one of Italy\u2019s most famous cold cases took them by surprise. \u201cYou have to explain why the case was reopened now,\u201d a lawyer for the family, Laura Sgro, said Tuesday. \u201cWe hope that the prosecutor\u2019s will is effectively real and will come to something soon.\u201d\n\nHer last filing on the case, Ms. Sgro noted, was 2019. Then in late 2021, she followed up with a letter written to Pope Francis telling the pontiff that new information had emerged that the family hoped to share with the Vatican. Francis urged her to contact the Vatican prosecutor \u201cin the spirit of full cooperation,\u201d but when she reached out to Mr. Diddi a year ago, she got no response, Ms. Sgro said. Over the decades, the family\u2019s quest to discover what happened to the teenager has taken many tortuous twists. Reports have variously linked her fate to the Sicilian Mafia, Bulgarian agents, a notorious Roman crime gang and the assassination attempt on John Paul II, by way of an American archbishop involved in a major Italian banking scandal. Previous investigations led nowhere. One involved the exhumation of bones from a crypt in a church in Rome, and another a search for evidence in a Vatican cemetery, which the Vatican allowed.\n\nMr. Diddi said that after becoming chief Vatican prosecutor three months ago, he began reviewing the requests made to it over the years by the Orlandi family. \u201cWe are putting in order all the things that have been presented to us,\u201d he said. Though dozens of books and documentaries have focused on the case in Italy, it received greater exposure after the release on Netflix last October of a four-part series titled \u201cVatican Girl,\u201d which explores the various theories that have emerged about her disappearance. The series also took the Vatican to task for not carrying out its own investigation and not doing more to help Italian authorities over the decades. \u201cIt was the first time the story was told internationally,\u201d said Chiara Messineo, the producer of the series, and it engaged audiences with \u201cthe story of a family that lost a daughter and a sister, that is very much also the story of a small pawn caught up\u201d in a global chessboard. Ms. Messineo, speaking from her home in London, said she believed the popularity of the series had increased the pressure on the Vatican \u201cso that they had to do something.\u201d Ms. Sgro, the lawyer, said a request made by lawmakers last month to establish a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the girl\u2019s disappearance, along with two other cold cases, may have also prompted the Vatican to finally act.",

            "content": "In a recent conversation in Brussels about Sudanese literature, three of its eminent writers \u2014 Abdelaziz Baraka Sakin, Hammour Ziada and Stella Gaitano \u2014 argued that it is the novelists of Sudan, not its historians or academics, who have mastered the courage to dive deep into Sudan\u2019s wounds and taboos. Indeed, such bravery meets us instantly in this debut novel by Fatin Abbas.\n\nSet in Saraaya, a town on the border between Sudan and South Sudan, the novel follows five dynamic characters in a compound owned by an American NGO, whose boss in Khartoum sees war as an opportunity to raise more money.\n\nWhile the book begins slowly, it picks up halfway through, when Sudan\u2019s complexities are realized through the stories of those living in the compound, and the author\u2019s rich imagination comes to life. Here we have Mustafa, a 12-year-old local boy, who does the chores. He\u2019s joined by Dena, from Khartoum, who grew up in Seattle and is in town to make a documentary. Alex is a white American from the suburbs of Cleveland who, as a geographer, is tasked with mapping Saraaya for the NGO. The compound is managed by William, a South Sudanese translator who doubles as a fixer. William\u2019s ambitions in Khartoum were thwarted by racism from the north Sudanese. His job at the NGO brought him dignity and a decent income, and reignited his dream to build a home, which he now hopes to do with Layla, a cook in the compound. But as a northern nomad and a Muslim, Layla is beyond reach for Catholic, Nilotic William.\n\nThe characters live quiet lives, though not in peace, since the civil war can engulf the town at any moment. Alas, things begin to unravel when a burned-up body turns up at the compound. Everyone is anxious about the return of violence, some more than others. Alex, who arrived at this \u201cexotic\u201d place imagining he would be \u201crunning naked through a plain\u201d and living a life of freedom away from the watchful eyes of his suburban community back home, is rattled out of his na\u00efvet\u00e9. For others, the conflict is initially an opportunity. It gives urgency to William\u2019s infatuation and budding relationship with sensual, audacious Layla \u2014 but can war bring them closer? For Mustafa, the looming violence invigorates his entrepreneurial spirit: He sells women\u2019s underwear when he\u2019s not working at the compound but then starts trading in guns. Dena, who, given her short hair, trousers and shirt, is often mistaken for a boy, is nonchalant about the rumors of imminent turmoil and continues to live fearlessly, as confident in her surroundings as she is in her sexuality.",

The discovery could complicate the Justice Department\u2019s approach to Donald Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents at Mar a Lago after he left office. But unlike Trump, who deliberately withheld classified documents after they were requested by the government, Biden immediately and voluntarily turned the documents over to the National Archives, according to his staff. And in Brazil\u2019s capital city on Monday, police began a widespread crackdown on supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro after thousands of them stormed government buildings over the weekend.

At the same time, Bolsonaro\u2019s successor, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, visited the damaged buildings, signed an emergency decree putting federal authorities in charge of securing Brazil\u2019s capital, and promised that those who had carried out the attack would be prosecuted.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAnd as recruits flock to the Bulldogs, they can thank quarterback Stetson Bennett IV, whose first stint with the team came as a walk-on.\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 It\u2019s hard to know when it was over. At the national anthem? The coin flip? The opening kickoff? Or perhaps even before that \u2014 the moment Noah Ruggles\u2019s kick for Ohio State sailed far, far left on New Year\u2019s Eve, giving Georgia a second life and scaring the Bulldogs straight in the process. Whenever it was, Georgia, the reigning national champion, wasted little time turning the College Football Playoff title game into a coronation, laying waste to pesky little Texas Christian with a 65-7 thumping that was every bit as decisive as the score might have indicated. The Georgia defense, led by the sticky hands of defensive back Javon Bullard, was all but impenetrable, and its offense, led by the peerless performance of quarterback Stetson Bennett IV, was all but unstoppable. Together, they overwhelmed the Horned Frogs, whose storied run \u2014 behind its folksy coach, its gutsy quarterback and a cast of unlikely characters, including a quirky Hypnotoad talisman \u2014 ended with a thud. Georgia, which rolled up 589 yards, did not punt until the second half \u2014 long after televisions surely had clicked off around the country. And with the way the Bulldogs continued to parade into the end zone and tee off on Max Duggan, the T.C.U. quarterback, it was a wonder that officials didn\u2019t order a running clock for the final quarter.\n\nThe only moment Georgia was baffled came when its coach, Kirby Smart, was asked afterward how a championship game could be so easy. \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for that,\u201d he said. The biggest previous margin of victory in a College Football Playoff final came four years ago when Clemson routed Alabama by 28 points. Georgia\u2019s margin exceeded that by halftime. The Bulldogs scored the most points ever in a title game, surpassing the 62 that Nebraska posted in clobbering Florida in the 1995 season. Georgia\u2019s romp could stand as a proxy for the gap between the rest of the country and the Bulldogs, who won their second consecutive national championship and their 33rd game in the last 34 tries. Their back-to-back titles are the first since Alabama\u2019s a decade ago. For a program that until last year was known mostly for falling short, Monday should not be the end of the line with so many freshmen and sophomores dotting its depth chart. Georgia may as well be renamed Blue Chip U. Each recruiting cycle, the top high school football prospects in the country, from California to Pennsylvania and all across the South, funnel into Athens, Ga. And each spring, many of those former prospects \u2014 after years spent in a football finishing school \u2014 trickle out to the N.F.L.\n\nYet the player most essential to the Bulldogs\u2019 two championships was someone not even Georgia wanted. Bennett, who grew up in speck-on-the-map Blackshear, Ga., did not have a scholarship from a Football Bowl Subdivision school, so he headed up to Athens in 2017 as a walk-on, intent on working his way into the starting quarterback job. A year later, Justin Fields, the top quarterback prospect in the country, showed up and those fealties to the school he grew up rooting for didn\u2019t mean much. Bennett wanted to play. So off he went to a Mississippi junior college. \u201cWhen I left, I thought it was deuces out forever from U.G.A.; I didn\u2019t think I was coming back,\u201d Bennett, who is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 pounds, said on Saturday. \u201cI kind of knew when I pulled the trigger that, hey, I\u2019m not here at Georgia just to hang out and be on the team and have some footballs in 30 years. I want to play ball. I want to do what I think I can do.\u201d When Bennett returned a year later, he did so only when Georgia offered him a scholarship on signing day to keep him from going to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Georgia still didn\u2019t know what it had. The team\u2019s offensive coordinator, Todd Monken, who arrived just as the coronavirus pandemic hit, was trying to parse through a crowded quarterbacks room, attempting to find reps for Jamie Newman, a transfer from Wake Forest; J.T. Daniels, a transfer from Southern California; and a pair of prized freshmen, D\u2019Wan Mathis and Carson Beck.\n\nDaniels won the job in 2020 but got hurt early in the 2021 season. The coaches were set to go with Beck for the second game of the season, but Bennett badly outplayed him in practice. Bennett has started every game since. \u201cWe\u2019re human,\u201d Monken said on Saturday. \u201cWe all have preconceived notions of how a person looks, their background. Oftentimes we\u2019re wrong \u2014 whatever it is, personal life, business, football. Sometimes you have to go by how they play.\u201d On Monday night, Bennett could do no wrong. He was precise throwing the ball. He completed 18 of 25 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns. He twice found Ladd McConkey, for scores of 37 and 14 yards, and added a 22-yarder to tight end Brock Bowers. His 22-yarder to Adonai Mitchell with 26 seconds left before halftime punctuated the Bulldogs\u2019 dominate half. Bennett was also dangerous running the ball. His two touchdown runs were waltzes into the end zone \u2014 untouched on a 21-yard keeper and a 6-yard scamper around the left end. And the Georgia defense was only slightly less flawless. The holes that were exposed the last two games by Ohio State and Louisiana State were patched up by Monday night. The Georgia secondary blanked T.C.U. receivers. Bullard, a sophomore, had two interceptions and a fumble recovery, and the Bulldogs held the star receiver Quentin Johnston to a single catch for 3 yards. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs\u2019 front punished Duggan, sacking him five times \u2014 three of which were recorded by freshmen. Georgia held the Horned Frogs, who entered averaging 474.1 yards per game, to a season-low 188. The only score Georgia surrendered was set up when it blew a coverage and Duggan connected with a wide-open Derius Davis for a 60-yard gain.\n\nSeveral plays later, Duggan ran into the end zone to make the score 10-7, Georgia. Finding any more highlights for the Horned Frogs would take some foraging. \u201cFor whatever reason, it went downhill from there,\u201d T.C.U. Coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened tonight. We ran into a very good team and it snowballed.\u201d In the other locker room, Georgia players puffed on cigars \u2014 when they figured out how to keep them lit \u2014 and talked about what amounts to a college football dynasty. The Bulldogs had 15 players drafted by the N.F.L. last April and did not bring anyone in through the transfer portal, so some backsliding was expected. And yet they were tested only twice: rallying from 10 points down in the fourth quarter to win at Missouri and coming back from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit in the semifinal victory against Ohio State, which they survived on the missed field-goal attempt. Next year, the challenge will be making do with a new quarterback. Bennett came off the field for the last time when Smart called a timeout to remove him with 13 minutes 25 seconds left, providing him with a curtain call and a bear hug as he reached the sideline. It was something Smart said he had never done before. When Smart got to the coach\u2019s office, he found his 10-year-old son, Andrew, in tears. Smart said he asked him what was wrong. \u201c\u2018Stetson is leaving,'\u201d Smart said, mimicking his son crying. \u201cI said: \u2018He\u2019s 25 years old. He\u2019s got to go. He\u2019s got to leave.\u2019\u201d Indeed, he must. But as Bennett does finally depart, his exit on Monday night was not unlike that of the rest of the Bulldogs, who made sure to leave an indelible mark.",

Adria Malcolm for The New York Times\n\nThe authorities in Albuquerque announced Monday that a suspect in the recent shootings at the homes or offices of a half-dozen Democratic elected officials was in custody on unrelated charges and that they had recovered a gun used in at least one of the shootings. Officials did not release information on the suspect other than to say that he is a man under 50; nor would they say what the unrelated charges were. \u201cWe are still trying to link and see which cases are related and which cases are not related,\u201d Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said at a news conference on Monday afternoon. Officials have ideas about a possible motive, Chief Medina said, but will not release details for fear of compromising the investigation. The authorities have not definitively tied the shootings to politics or ideology. Police officials asked the courts to seal all paperwork related to the case, Chief Medina said. He said that the authorities had numerous search warrants and were waiting for additional evidence. No one was hurt in the shootings, four of which happened in December and two that took place this month. The shootings involved four homes, a workplace and a campaign office associated with two county commissioners, two state senators and New Mexico\u2019s newly elected attorney general. The police had provided details last week on five of the shootings. On Monday, they said that they were also investigating a shooting that occurred in early December and caused damage to the home of Javier Mart\u00ednez, a New Mexico state representative set to become the State Legislature\u2019s next speaker of the House. Mr. Mart\u00ednez said he had heard the gunfire in December, and recently discovered the damage after he heard of the attacks related to the other elected officials. He decided to inspect the outside of his home, KOB reported. In addition to the Albuquerque Police Department, the New Mexico State Police and Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office are investigating the shootings. If a federal crime was committed, the Police Department will pursue those charges, Chief Medina said. \u201cThe federal system has much stronger teeth than our state system,\u201d he said. The shootings came at a time when public officials have faced a surge in violent threats, extending from members of Congress to a Supreme Court justice. Mayor Tim Keller of Albuquerque said he hoped the fact that a suspect was in custody would provide some comfort to elected officials, who he said should be able to do their jobs without fear. \u201cThese are individuals who participate in democracy, whether we agree with them or not,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this act of violence, I think, has been so rattling for so many people.\u201d",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "A banner bears portraits of Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne, President Emmanuel Macron and Labour Minister Olivier Dussopt. It reads \u201cno pension for the dead people\u201d and was part of a rally on Tuesday against the government\u2019s pension reform plan in Rennes, in northwest France.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is focusing on cutting costs in France\u2019s pension system, but labor unions, which fiercely oppose the measure, have promised a showdown.\n\nPARIS \u2014 The French government on Tuesday unveiled long-expected plans to raise the legal age of retirement to 64 from 62, part of changes to the country\u2019s pension system that President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to see through a fractured Parliament despite weak popular support, hostile labor unions and the threat of disruptive strikes and protests. Mr. Macron\u2019s last attempt to change the pension system in 2019 prompted massive street protests and one of the longest transportation strikes in France\u2019s history, until the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the government shelved the plan. Back then, the government did not intend to raise the retirement age and was aiming instead for an overhaul of the pension system\u2019s architecture, by consolidating 42 different programs into a unified system \u2014 plans that left many French people confused and worried that they would end up with less money. Mr. Macron\u2019s newest plan is a more straightforward attempt to balance the system\u2019s budget by making the French work longer, a move that is still likely to meet strong popular resistance.\n\nThe latest attempt also comes at a time of heightened social strife, fueling worries that anger over pensions could snowball into a winter of discontent, in a repeat of the Yellow Vest movement \u2014 a revolt against higher fuel taxes that morphed into broader protests \u2014 that rocked Mr. Macron\u2019s first term. Labor unions have promised strikes and demonstrations over the proposals, even though analysts say the country\u2019s ability to stomach weeks of social unrest might be diminished after an exhausting Covid-19 pandemic and persistent concerns over inflation and energy prices. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the unions insisted that the pension system was \u201cnot in danger\u201d and that \u201cnothing justifies such a brutal reform,\u201d as they announced a first day of strikes and protest next week. Mr. Macron, who made a pension overhaul a cornerstone of his successful re-election campaign, argues that he has a strong mandate and that France\u2019s complex but generous, state-backed pension system will run an unsustainable deficit if nothing is done. \u201cWe have to be able to face reality and find solutions to preserve our social model,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne said at a news conference on Tuesday to announce the plans, which brewed for months at the highest levels of French government as Mr. Macron\u2019s allies debated how to proceed. They ultimately backed down from his campaign vow to raise the retirement age to 65.\n\n\u201cThis will indeed be the year of pension reform, which aims to ensure the balance of our system for the years and decades to come,\u201d Mr. Macron said in his New Year\u2019s Eve address. \u201cWe need to work more,\u201d he added, to \u201cpass on to our children a fair and durable social model, because it will be credible and financed in the long term.\u201d Mr. Macron\u2019s party has a tenuous majority in the lower house of Parliament, and all left-wing parties, as well as the far-right, are opposed to the plan; some have vowed to bury the pension bill in an avalanche of amendments. But France\u2019s Republicans, its mainstream conservative party, have signaled willingness to vote for a version of the plan. Without that support, the government would be forced to use special constitutional powers to ram it through the lower house. Mr. Macron\u2019s government has used those powers before for budget bills, but resorting to them on far more consequential and contested legislation could inflame tensions at a time when the government is already racing to defuse budding crises \u2014 most recently, by swiftly offering financial relief to angry bakers facing sky-high energy prices. \u00c9ric Ciotti, the leader of the Republicans, said in a recent interview with the Journal du Dimanche that his party had demands of its own but that France\u2019s \u201cbudgetary, demographic and economic situation\u201d justified retirement changes.\n\n\u201cAny reasonable person understands that the current system cannot continue without reform,\u201d he said. But labor unions, despite weeks of meetings with the government, have already unanimously rejected Mr. Macron\u2019s plan. They are expected to call for massive strikes and street protests that they hope will force his hand. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Souillot, the head of the Force Ouvri\u00e8re union, said recently that if Mr. Macron wanted to make his pension plan \u201cthe mother of all reforms, for us it will be the mother of all battles.\u201d Even moderate unions that are open to tweaking the existing system say that raising the legal age of retirement is a non-starter. They say it will unfairly impact blue-collar retirees with arduous jobs, who often start their careers earlier and have shorter life expectancy, on average, than white-collar ones.\n\nLaurent Berger, the head of the C.F.D.T., or French Democratic Confederation of Labor, a moderate union that the government unsuccessfully courted, told Le Parisien recently that pushing back the retirement age was \u201cthe most unfair\u201d way to reform pensions. \u201cThere will be no deal with the C.F.D.T.,\u201d he warned. State-guaranteed pensions are widely cherished as a hard-won right by the French, who enjoy one of the lowest rates of pensioners at risk of poverty in Europe. Polls show that public opinion is against raising the retirement age and is not sold on the urgency of reform, especially given that France already struggles with senior unemployment.\n\n\u201cFor many French people, retirement is kind of the only moment in life where you fully take advantage of your freedom,\u201d said Luc Rouban, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Political Research at Sciences Po in Paris. To mollify resistance, Ms. Borne unveiled measures that the government says will make the system fairer, like an increased 1,200 euro, about $1,300, minimum monthly pension, continued exemptions allowing those who begin working at younger ages to retire earlier and measures to help seniors stay employed. \u201cWe are not equal before work, one cannot ask everyone to all work longer in the same way,\u201d Ms. Borne said. She estimated that four out of 10 seniors would still be able to retire before 64 under the new reforms. While French workers can build up private retirement savings, that does not constitute the backbone of the system. Instead workers and employers pay mandatory payroll taxes that are used to fund the pensions of retirees. That balance has grown increasingly precarious as life expectancies increase. In 2000, there were 2.1 workers paying into the system for every one retiree; in 2020 that ratio had fallen to 1.7, and in 2070 it is expected to drop to 1.2, according to official projections. In 2021, the average age of retirement in France \u2014 for those who were part of the general pension program \u2014 was roughly 63; but some workers are able to retire earlier. Mr. Macron says the system should be put on surer financial footing now, to avoid painful cost-cutting measures in the future. Opponents accuse him of painting an overly gloomy picture. Analysts say both have a point.\n\n\u201cWhen pension issues were discussed before major reforms in the 1990s or 2000s, pension spending had exploded as a percentage of national income, but today that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Antoine Bozio, an economist at the Paris School of Economics. The French pension system ran a 900 million euro surplus in 2021, one that is expected to grow to 3.2 billion euros in 2022, according to the latest official figures. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d Mr. Bozio added, because the system\u2019s deficit is expected to grow again starting in 2023, although there is disagreement over how serious that is and how quickly it needs to be addressed. At stake, Mr. Bozio said, is Mr. Macron\u2019s ability \u201cto present a reform that increases the retirement age, but is not perceived as particularly unfair.\u201d",

This year\u2019s Golden Globes ceremony was not a typical awards show.\n\nThe 80th Golden Globe Awards was the first edition of the annual spectacle to be on TV since an ethics, finance and diversity scandal involving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the awards, led NBC to decide not to air the 2022 ceremony. So the biggest question was really whether the show\u2019s organizers could win back the trust of viewers, the network and the Hollywood figures whose presence it relies on. (The attitude during the telecast largely seemed to be that it had; whether that feeling extends beyond the ceremony remains to be seen.)\n\nStill, there were formal winners.\n\nThe ceremony began with film supporting actor and actress wins for Ke Huy Quan (\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d) and Angela Bassett (\u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d), and a TV supporting actor win for Tyler James Williams (\u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d). Later, Steven Spielberg won the third best director Golden Globe of his career for \u201cThe Fabelmans.\u201d And the top TV and film awards went to \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d (best TV series, musical or comedy), \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d (best TV series, drama), \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d (best picture, musical or comedy) and \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d (best motion picture, drama).

Here\u2019s what we know and don\u2019t know about their effectiveness.\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been remarkably transparent about their psychological struggles. In a documentary about mental health that he filmed with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, Harry included a video of himself undergoing E.M.D.R., or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, which helps people with post-traumatic stress disorder cope with triggering memories. Ms. Markle has spoken candidly about experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts. Harry\u2019s new memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d is no different, including raw and sometimes shocking details about his battles with mental illness. At the center of many of these experiences is his grief and trauma over the death in 1997 of his mother, Princess Diana, when he was 12 years old. In the book, he described trying both traditional and unconventional ways to cope with his pain and that using psychedelics was particularly helpful. After one therapist suggested that he suffered from PTSD, Harry started to use mushrooms and ayahuasca \u201ctherapeutically, medicinally.\u201d (He had previously experimented with psychedelics recreationally.) \u201cThey didn\u2019t simply allow me to escape reality for a while, they let me redefine reality,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPsychedelic therapy has experienced a groundswell of enthusiasm over the past decade as research mounts showing the mind-altering drugs can be useful for treating depression and other mental health disorders. (The therapy is still illegal in most places and is primarily done in underground sessions, abroad or through clinical trials.) However, there is scant evidence about whether psilocybin \u2014 the psychoactive ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms \u2014 and ayahuasca might be helpful for processing grief and trauma specifically. Dr. Joshua Woolley, director of the Translational Psychedelic Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco, is optimistic about the drugs\u2019 potential. \u201cCan psychedelics help with the experience of grief? I would say probably yes,\u201d he said. But other experts are less bullish on the idea of using them for trauma. \u201cThe actual evidence is really lacking,\u201d said Dr. Shaili Jain, a PTSD specialist at Stanford University and author of \u201cThe Unspeakable Mind.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very early, and we still don\u2019t know the long-term side effects. We are not there yet.\u201d The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

Here\u2019s a look at Dysfunction and disorder are hardly restricted to the House of Windsor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies Grief is not a mental illness; it is a normal human experience that comes after the loss of a loved one. Sadness, anger and disbelief that the person is dead \u2014 something that Harry described in his book \u2014 are all typical responses to the profound pain of death and can last for months or years. However, if the grief has not improved at all after a year and is affecting a person\u2019s ability to function, a diagnosis of prolonged grief, sometimes called complicated grief, might be warranted. \u201cWhat we see with prolonged grief is that the grief becomes very entrenched, that things look the same for this person today as they did the day after\u201d the death, said Mary-Frances O\u2019Connor, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona and author of \u201cThe Grieving Brain.\u201d \u201cFor a person who\u2019s adapting more typically, a year after a loss, they\u2019re still going to have sadness. They\u2019re still going to miss the person who\u2019s gone. But you can see this trajectory of change where they have started to restore a life that feels meaningful to them.\u201d\n\nPeople with prolonged grief may feel that life has lost its meaning or that a part of themselves has also died; they might have intense emotional pain or feel complete psychological numbness. Harry does not say in his book whether he was ever diagnosed with prolonged grief, but he does describe some of these emotions, and symptoms of PTSD and prolonged grief often overlap. About 10 percent of people mourning a loved one will develop prolonged grief, and the risk is higher if the death happened suddenly or traumatically. Treatment for prolonged grief often involves cognitive behavioral therapy to help people start to move on and engage in meaningful activities again while they continue to cope with the grief. \u201cIt\u2019s not about taking grief away,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning how to live with the fact that you are a person who has waves of grief now.\u201d Scientists think that psychedelics work in two ways: through their chemical effects on the brain and the subjective experiences a person has while on the drugs. For many people, psychedelics act like \u201ca very intense, fast psychotherapy,\u201d Dr. Woolley said. Psychedelics \u201chave this potential to induce these transpersonal states of consciousness where people might feel like they are connected\u201d to the deceased relative or friend, added Greg Fonzo, co-director of the Center for Psychedelic Research and Therapy at Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThat might allow people to move past some of the stuckness that occurs when they\u2019re in this phase of grief.\u201d In the brain, scientists think that psychedelics induce a \u201cplastic state,\u201d helping to rapidly form new connections between cells. Those new connections may be behind the insights and reprocessing that people can experience when they use the drugs in a therapeutic setting. There are very few published studies focusing on psychedelics\u2019 effect on people experiencing prolonged grief. In one of the few relevant trials, Dr. Woolley looked at whether psilocybin, combined with group therapy, could help older, long-term AIDS survivors process their depression and survivor\u2019s guilt surrounding their diagnosis, as well as the loss of friends and family to AIDS. The 2020 study, which included just 18 men, assessed the participants\u2019 levels of demoralization \u2014 a therapeutic term for an existential sense of hopelessness and loss of meaning in life. Most of the participants had experienced profound grief and trauma because of the AIDS epidemic; on average, the participants had lost 17 loved ones to the disease. After one psychedelic therapy session, nearly 90 percent of the men experienced a reduction in demoralization, and many saw a decrease in symptoms of PTSD and complicated grief. In a follow-up paper describing the men\u2019s subjective experiences, the researchers wrote that psilocybin was \u201ca catalyst for reconstructing their identities from rigidly centered on their past traumas to more flexible and growth-oriented life narratives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people in our study often talked about feeling stuck and detached from people around them and not able to move forward,\u201d Dr. Woolley said. The psilocybin \u201cdid seem to help them move forward, to become unstuck and start being more engaged in life.\u201d Another study published in 2020 by researchers in Spain found that 39 bereaved adults who took part in ayahuasca ceremonies at a retreat center in Peru reported a decrease in the severity of their grief, and those benefits lasted for at least a year. The researchers wrote that people using ayahuasca to process their grief \u201cdescribed emotional confrontations with the reality of the death, the reviewing of biographical memories, and a re-encounter with the deceased.\u201d While these results are promising, both studies were small and neither included a control arm to compare the effects of the psychedelics against a placebo or another medication. The majority of participants in the ayahuasca study also reported that they expected to benefit from the experience, which may have had an impact on the results. There is stronger evidence that psilocybin can be useful in treating depression, including in trials comparing the drugs\u2019 efficacy to standard antidepressant medications. Similarly, M.D.M.A, which is sometimes classified as a psychedelic, has been shown to be effective at treating PTSD. Some researchers think that because prolonged grief has many similarities with depression and PTSD, psychedelics could be useful for treating it too. Dr. O\u2019Connor said that given how scientists think psychedelics work in the brain to treat depression, it\u2019s conceivable that the drugs could also be helpful for people with prolonged grief. However, she cautioned against using the drugs to cope with grief that had not been diagnosed as prolonged or complicated. \u201cI would not say that it is appropriate to intervene with something as mind-altering, as dramatic, as psychedelic therapy if a person is, in fact, healing in the way that we would expect them to,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cMeaning, I would worry that you could do more harm than good and that it just may not be necessary.\u201d The experts also emphasized that experimenting with the drugs recreationally is not the same as using them in a controlled therapeutic environment. After trying psychedelics in both settings, Prince Harry echoed this sentiment. In an interview with 60 Minutes, he said that he \u201cwould never recommend people to do this recreationally,\u201d but that in the right setting the drugs worked \u201cas a medicine\u201d to help him process his grief and trauma.",

He is still technically a free agent even though he has agreed to new terms with Minnesota.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nOn Dec. 21, the shortstop agreed to a $315 million contract with the Mets. Three weeks later, he signed a $200 million deal with Minnesota. What happened?\n\nOn Dec. 21, the Mets were declared by many as the winners of the off-season after they agreed to terms with Carlos Correa, one of the top infielders in baseball, on a 12-year, $315 million contract. The Mets, who won 101 games in 2022, were adding an all-around superstar in what they hoped was the final piece in the team owner Steven A. Cohen\u2019s championship puzzle. The Mets deal, which came after Correa\u2019s 13-year, $350 million deal with the San Francisco Giants the week before unraveled, was \u201cpending a physical examination,\u201d contract language that is often glossed over like the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d on a website. Three weeks later however, Correa, 28, a shortstop, walked away from that deal as well. On Wednesday, he completed an agreement with the Minnesota Twins, whom he played for last season, on a six-year, $200 million contract. The deal, details of which were confirmed by personnel familiar with the negotiations on condition of anonymity, was announced by the team on Wednesday. After a physical examination had held up both of his previously agreed upon deals, Correa passed Minnesota\u2019s physical on Tuesday, which allowed for the deal to be made official.\n\nHadn\u2019t Correa already signed with the Mets? What about the Giants? Correa\u2019s deal with the Giants would have been the second-largest of this off-season, according to Spotrac. The one he agreed to with the Mets would have been the third-largest. But both were held up after the teams conducted physical examinations, with concerns focusing on the long-term health of his right leg. Rather than rework those deals, Correa accepted a contract with Minnesota that guarantees him far less money overall but pays him considerably more annually. With this deal, Correa trails only Francisco Lindor of the Mets among shortstops in average salary, but his contract is smaller in total value than the ones agreed to this off-season by Trea Turner (11 years, $300 million with Philadelphia) and Xander Bogaerts (11 years, $280 million with San Diego).\n\nHow is his new contract different? In his new agreement with the Twins, Correa will be paid an average of $33,333,333 per season over six years and could increase his earnings up to $245 million over seven years by reaching certain benchmarks, according to the person familiar with the negotiations. There are vesting options built into the deal to protect the team and potentially benefit the player, including ones tied to playing time and where he places in regular season and postseason awards. Are protections like these unusual? Not particularly. In the past, Boras clients like Ivan Rodriguez, J.D. Drew and Magglio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez agreed to contracts that contained language to protect the teams after medical issues arose while still paying the players competitive salaries.\n\nIn an unusual move, Cohen addressed the signing before it was completed \u2014 a decision he undoubtedly regrets. \u201cWe needed one more thing, and this is it,\u201d Cohen told Jon Heyman of The New York Post on the day the deal came together. \u201cThis was important. This puts us over the top.\u201d Heyman later reported that the Mets sold $1 million in tickets on the day the Correa news was reported. On Wednesday, shortly after Minnesota announced their deal with Correa had been completed, the Mets issued a statement: \u201cWe were unable to reach an agreement. We wish Carlos all the best.\u201d\n\nOvernight, the Mets news was reported, and Scott Boras, Correa\u2019s agent, brushed off any suggestion that there were issues with Correa\u2019s health, telling The New York Times that \u201cmedical opinions are just what they are \u2014 opinions.\u201d The Giants then issued a statement about the negotiations. \u201cWhile we are prohibited from disclosing confidential medical information, as Scott Boras stated publicly, there was a difference of opinion over the results of Carlos\u2019s physical examination,\u201d said the statement, which was attributed to Farhan Zaidi, the team\u2019s president for baseball operations. \u201cWe wish Carlos the best.\u201d Zaidi later addressed the issue further in a conference call with beat reporters, taking issue with the idea that the team had blindsided Correa and Boras with their concerns.\n\nThe short answer is no. The long answer is long. Nearly all of the speculation and anonymously sourced reporting has focused on the state of Correa\u2019s lower right leg. In 2014, two years after Houston selected him as the No. 1 pick in the draft, Correa was thriving for Class A Lancaster when an awkward slide into third base resulted in his spike catching in the dirt. Correa, who was 19 at the time, was carried off the field. What was initially diagnosed as an ankle injury ended up being a fractured fibula, with what was described as minor ligament damage. He had season-ending surgery five days after the injury occurred, and Jeff Luhnow, the general manager of the Astros at the time, said the team expected Correa to \u201creturn to exactly the point he was at when he got injured.\u201d\n\nThat certainly appeared to be what happened. In 2015, Correa began the season with Class AA Corpus Christi and was promoted to Class AAA Fresno after 29 games. He thrived there as well and was called up to the Astros after only 24 games at the minors\u2019 highest level. In Houston, he hit .279 with 22 home runs and 14 stolen bases in 99 games and narrowly edged his close friend Lindor, who played for Cleveland at the time, as the American League rookie of the year. While Correa missed significant time with injuries in 2017, 2018 and 2019, none of those absences were related to his right leg. And he has been fairly durable since, playing in 342 of his team\u2019s 384 regular-season games since the start of the 2020 season. If there are other concerns with his physical examination, beyond the previous leg surgery, they have not been reported.\n\nSo the leg has not been an issue at all? Mostly. The old injury, and the way it was repaired, resurfaced briefly last season when Correa was playing for the Twins. On Sept. 20, he tried to steal second and came up limping after being tagged out. After the game, he was not concerned that he had seriously hurt himself. \u201cHe just hit my plate,\u201d Correa told reporters. \u201cI had surgery, and he hit it. Just kind of felt numb. Vibrating. So I was just waiting for it to calm down. It was a little scary, but when I moved I knew it was good.\u201d Sure enough, he was back in the lineup the next day and did not miss any time as a result of the slide. Extraordinarily long contracts like the ones Correa had agreed to with the Giants and the Mets carry a large amount of risk and are difficult to insure. Going into one with a known issue that could limit a player\u2019s mobility as he ages would increase that risk. That is particularly true of a player like Correa, who derives a lot of his value from his defense and athleticism.\n\nWill the Mets be OK without him? For all the money Cohen has spent this off-season \u2014 the Mets\u2019 payroll and luxury taxes had been expected to approach $500 million in 2023 \u2014 the team\u2019s offense was not upgraded other than Correa. That being said, third baseman Eduardo Escobar, who hit 20 home runs in his first year with the Mets, is still under contract, as is second baseman Jeff McNeil, the N.L.\u2019s batting champion last season. And Lindor, despite not being as strong a fielder as Correa, was expected to remain at shortstop all along. So not signing Correa is a blow to the Mets, but it does not really leave them with a hole in their lineup. Is he worth all this fuss? In the short term, yes. Correa has never hit 30 homers or driven in 100 runs in a season. He has never stolen 20 bases or won a Most Valuable Player Award. But he has proved to be remarkably valuable when healthy thanks to his consistently solid batting average, his ability to draw walks, his good baserunning and his defense. In the three seasons in which he has played at least 130 games, he has compiled 7.0, 7.2 and 5.4 wins above replacement, according to Baseball Reference\u2019s formula. Those figures are on the cusp of M.V.P.-level play. As a result of his all-around game, Baseball Reference rates him as the most valuable shortstop in baseball since 2015 despite his having played far fewer games than Lindor and Bogaerts, who are second and third on that list. There is no question of talent, or leadership, with Correa. The risk for the Twins is wrapped up entirely in whether Correa\u2019s body can hold up for the life of a contract. In the end, that risk was too much for the Giants and the Mets.",

Here\u2019s what other countries can learn from its success.\n\nA typical lesson that Saara Martikka, a teacher in Hameenlinna, Finland, gives her students goes like this: She presents her eighth graders with news articles. Together, they discuss: What\u2019s the purpose of the article? How and when was it written? What are the author\u2019s central claims? \u201cJust because it\u2019s a good thing or it\u2019s a nice thing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true or it\u2019s valid,\u201d she said. In a class last month, she showed students three TikTok videos, and they discussed the creators\u2019 motivations and the effect that the videos had on them. Her goal, like that of teachers around Finland, is to help students learn to identify false information.\n\nFinland ranked No. 1 of 41 European countries on resilience against misinformation for the fifth time in a row in a survey published in October by the Open Society Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria. Officials say Finland\u2019s success is not just the result of its strong education system, which is one of the best in the world, but also because of a concerted effort to teach students about fake news. Media literacy is part of the national core curriculum starting in preschool.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the teacher is teaching, whether it\u2019s physical education or mathematics or language, you have to think, \u2018OK, how do I include these elements in my work with children and young people?\u2019\u201d said Leo Pekkala, the director of Finland\u2019s National Audiovisual Institute, which oversees media education. After Finland, the European countries that ranked highest for resilience to misinformation in the Open Society Institute survey were Norway, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland and Sweden. The countries that were the most vulnerable to misinformation were Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania.

A survey by Gallup, published in October, found that just 34 percent of Americans trusted the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly, slightly higher than the lowest number that the organization recorded, in 2016. In Finland, 76 percent of Finns consider print and digital newspapers to be reliable, according to an August survey commissioned by a trade group representing Finnish newspapers that was conducted by IRO Research, a market research company. Finland has advantages in countering misinformation. Its public school system is among the best in the world. College is free. There is high trust in the government, and Finland was one of the European countries least affected by the pandemic. Teachers are highly respected.\n\nOn top of that, Finnish is spoken by about 5.4 million people. Articles containing falsehoods that are written by nonnative speakers can sometimes be easily identified because of grammatical or syntax errors, Mr. Pekkala said. While teachers in Finland are required to teach media literacy, they have significant discretion over how to carry out lessons. Mrs. Martikka, the middle school teacher, said she tasked students with editing their own videos and photos to see how easy it was to manipulate information. A teacher in Helsinki, Anna Airas, said she and her students searched words like \u201cvaccination\u201d and discussed how search algorithms worked and why the first results might not always be the most reliable. Other teachers also said that in recent months, during the war in Ukraine, they had used Russian news sites and memes as the basis for a discussion about the effects of state-sponsored propaganda. Finland, which shares an 833-mile border with Russia, developed its national goals for media education in 2013 and accelerated its campaign to teach students to spot misinformation in the following years. Paivi Leppanen, a project coordinator at the Finnish National Agency for Education, a government agency, said the threat of Russian misinformation on topics such as Finland\u2019s bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u201chasn\u2019t changed the basics of what we do, but it has shown us that this is the time for what we have been preparing.\u201d Even though today\u2019s teenagers have grown up with social media, that does not mean that they know how to identify and guard against manipulated videos of politicians or news articles on TikTok. In fact, a study published last year in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology found that adolescence could be a peak time for conspiracy theorizing. A contributing factor could be social media, with its influence over young people\u2019s beliefs about the world, the study\u2019s authors wrote. Still, the Finnish government says students are among the easiest group to reach. Now that programs are in place for young people, the government is using libraries as centers for teaching older people to identify online information that is intended to mislead, Mr. Pekkala said.\n\nFor teachers of any age group, coming up with effective lessons can be challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to talk about literature, which we have been studying for hundreds of years,\u201d said Mari Uusitalo, a middle and high school teacher in Helsinki. She starts with the basics \u2014 by teaching students about the difference between what they see on Instagram and TikTok versus what they read in Finnish newspapers. \u201cThey really can\u2019t understand fake news or misinformation or anything if they don\u2019t understand the relationship between social media and journalism,\u201d she said. During Ms. Uusitalo\u2019s 16 years as a teacher, she has noticed a clear decline in reading comprehension skills, a trend she attributes to students\u2019 spending less time with books and more time with games and watching videos. With poorer reading skills and shorter attention spans, students are more vulnerable to believing fake news or not having enough knowledge about topics to identify misleading or wrong information, she said. When her students were talking this summer about leaked videos that showed Finland\u2019s prime minister, Sanna Marin, dancing and singing at a party, Ms. Uusitalo moderated a discussion about how news stories can originate from videos circulating on social media. Some of her students had believed Ms. Marin was using drugs at the party after watching videos on TikTok and Twitter that suggested that. Ms. Marin denied having taken drugs, and a test later came back negative. Ms. Uusitalo said her goal was to teach students methods they could use to distinguish between truth and fiction. \u201cI can\u2019t make them think just like me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have to give them the tools to make up their own opinions.\u201d",

            "section": "Theater",
            "content": "Original members of the Broadway production, clockwise from left: Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas, Common, Rosal Col\u00f3n and Stephen McKinley Henderson. Three of the actors \u2014 Common is a newcomer \u2014 participated in early readings at the real Riverside Drive apartment as the play was being developed.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\n\u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy,\u201d Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning script, is set in a rent-controlled apartment that was inspired by the playwright\u2019s own.\n\nThe world of \u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy,\u201d the Stephen Adly Guirgis play that opened on Broadway last month, is confined to a rent-controlled Upper West Side apartment building, where the dark comedy spools out over kitchen table bickering and rooftop joint passing. It\u2019s the kind of New York City apartment that has stayed in the family despite rising rents and a landlord bent on eviction \u2014 the kind of apartment that Guirgis himself inherited from his father, an Egyptian immigrant who managed a restaurant at Grand Central and had little else to pass on when he died. Like the one in the play, the real Riverside Drive apartment is a \u201cgrand old railroad flat with chandeliers and a river view,\u201d as Guirgis\u2019s introduction to the play reads, with \u201cbeautiful fixtures, family mementos and antique furniture competing for survival with dust, stains, garbage, leaks and unattended junk.\u201d About a decade ago, Guirgis started gathering actors there to read his developing play, about a Black New York City police officer who was shot while off duty at a bar by a white officer and has been seeking justice ever since.\n\nThe play that developed from those readings became a patchwork of autobiography and fiction, organized around an idea based on a local news story from the 1990s. Directed by Austin Pendleton, \u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy\u201d went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in drama after premiering at Atlantic Theater Company in 2014 and running Off Broadway for a second time in 2015. (In that production, Ron Cephas Jones, a friend of Guirgis\u2019s who once lived at the four-bedroom Riverside Drive apartment, played the lead character\u2019s son, Junior.) Eight years after its premiere, the play has landed on Broadway \u2014 the Second Stage production at the Helen Hayes Theater still stars Henderson, with Common now playing Junior \u2014 in a radically altered landscape. Since the actors first gathered at Guirgis\u2019s apartment, police shootings of Black men have fueled waves of protest. The murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer in 2020 reignited the movement, with myriad industries, including theater, facing calls for large-scale racial justice efforts. In addition, rent rates in New York City have been soaring, boxing out lower-income residents from once-affordable neighborhoods, and evictions have picked back up after a pandemic lull.\n\nThe actors who have inhabited their characters for years say they approach the work with a new depth and personal understanding, but the dialogue remains almost entirely the same. One short line was added, from Junior, a parolee who struggles to get the kind of love from his father that he received from his recently deceased mother. \u201cPops, it\u2019s 2014,\u201d Junior says, situating the audience in time. Guirgis said he asked that the line be added to prevent references to Donald J. Trump and Rudy Giuliani from sounding outdated. The actress Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas, who has been involved since early script readings as a character called the Church Lady, said people who have seen this production and previous ones (including her mother) are convinced that the play has been significantly altered over the years.\n\n\u201cThe writing didn\u2019t change,\u201d Col\u00f3n-Zayas said. \u201cThe pain, and the years, and what we\u2019ve survived has changed this play in ways that I can\u2019t exactly articulate.\u201d The seed for the story came in 1994, when a white off-duty New York City police officer opened fire on a Black undercover transit officer on a Manhattan subway platform, seriously injuring him. The white officer, Peter Del-Debbio, said he was responding to a shotgun that had discharged and had fired when he saw the plainclothes transit officer, Desmond Robinson, running with a gun.\n\nPart of the white officer\u2019s defense was that the Black officer wasn\u2019t wearing his badge or the color that would identify him as a plainclothes officer, so Guirgis remembered the story as the \u201ccolor of the day\u201d case. Del-Debbio was convicted of second-degree assault and was sentenced to probation and community service. \u201cIt always stayed with me,\u201d Guirgis said. Years later, the playwright said, he was visiting Henderson when the veteran actor, having health troubles, remarked that his career would be slowing down. \u201cI just lied and I was like, \u2018Oh I started writing two plays for you: one where you\u2019re the lead and one where you\u2019re the supporting,\u2019\u201d Guirgis said. \u201cWhen I went home I was like, OK, now I\u2019ve got to come up with something.\u201d By the time he started holding script readings, Col\u00f3n-Zayas, who met Guirgis when they were students at State University of New York at Albany, had been visiting the Riverside Drive apartment for decades. When Guirgis\u2019s mother died in 2006, he recalled, his family returned to the apartment to find Col\u00f3n-Zayas and other friends cleaning it. After his mother\u2019s death, Guirgis moved into the apartment, getting his father a dog, Papi, for additional companionship. The apartment became a haven for friends who needed one, Guirgis said, including a recovering addict who started to see Guirgis\u2019s father like he was his own. \u201cAnybody who walked into my apartment with me or with my sister was automatically given a blank check of love and acceptance,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the play, as Walter fights to hold on to his home and win his long-running lawsuit against the New York Police Department, a series of characters passes through the apartment \u2014 ostensibly there to help a solitary widower. Two police colleagues gather for dinner and a serving of nostalgia; the Church Lady comes to chat and give communion. But in \u201cRiverside,\u201d the intentions of the houseguests are never clear-cut. The relationships get messy, and the underlying politics of the story even messier. Henderson\u2019s character is portrayed as both noble and, at times, misguided. He maintains both a righteous grudge against the New York Police Department and a fierce pride for it. His children, biological and not, are both trying to change their lives for the better and backsliding into old ways. Guirgis is well aware that the persistent character flaws have the tendency to rankle some audience members who would have preferred to see their worldviews affirmed more emphatically. But he\u2019s interested in telling a more complicated story, and says he thinks present-day audiences will see that, just as they did in 2014. \u201cIf the characters all just have white hats and black hats, then we\u2019re watching a cartoon, and there\u2019s nothing to learn from it,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to make it messy but I try to lead with love.\u201d",

The commission repeated its notice to customers to immediately stop using the product, which rocks babies to sleep in a cloth-covered cradle, and to contact Fisher-Price for refunds or vouchers. The sleepers had sold for between $40 and $149, the commission said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mattel, the parent company of Fisher-Price, said on Tuesday that the company stopped selling the Rock \u2019n Play Sleeper when the recall was announced in April 2019. \u201cSince then, the company has worked diligently to remove all recalled product from the market,\u201d the spokeswoman, Catherine Frymark, said. \u201cToday\u2019s reannouncement serves as a critical reminder to both consumers and resellers that they should not use, sell, or donate the recalled Rock \u2019n Play.\u201d",

            "content": "Two Oakland, Calif., police officers and a lawyer for one of the men at a 2002 trial at which the officers, members of a group known as the Riders, were charged with criminal abuses.\n\n\u201cThe Riders Come Out at Night,\u201d by Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham, is a case study of corruption and reform within a single police department \u2014 with implications for all of us.\n\nTHE RIDERS COME OUT AT NIGHT: Brutality, Corruption, and Cover-Up in Oakland, by Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham It\u2019s been more than two years since protesters filled the streets of America\u2019s cities, since we all saw the video of a police officer\u2019s knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck. And yet killings at the hands of law enforcement, by various metrics, continue at a steady pace. Set aside for a moment the debates about crime rates and the calls to abolish the police (or, at the other extreme, to place officers beyond criticism). Ask instead what it would take to hold police accountable for abuses, in a minimally satisfying way, and what role civilians can or should play. How many protesters went on to join a citizen oversight board? How many knocked on doors for district attorney or sheriff candidates who promised change? And how long until we witness the next George Floyd, and another cycle of outrage, reform and backsliding? It\u2019s hard not to ask such cynical questions after reading \u201cThe Riders Come Out at Night: Brutality, Corruption, and Cover-Up in Oakland,\u201d an exhaustive case study of policing in the Bay Area city by the reporters Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham. \u201cMore has been done to try to reform the Oakland Police Department than any other police force in the United States,\u201d they write, arguing that the racially mixed city of less than half a million holds \u201cparallels for other communities that have struggled to reign in the coercive arm of the state.\u201d\n\nThe main parallel seems to be: True reform is nearly impossible. By zooming in geographically, but also stretching out their timeline \u2014 the town had a racist mayor who unleashed police officers against Chinese immigrants back in 1879 \u2014 the authors conjure a sense of chronic tragedy. A culture of corruption and violence keeps flourishing despite repeated good faith efforts to stop the bad apples, who continue to show up, generation after generation, to spoil the barrel. The book\u2019s title calls to mind the night riders associated with the Ku Klux Klan, but it\u2019s also a metaphor that feels fresher than the one about apples: \u201cNight\u201d represents the moments when the public lets up on scrutinizing the police. Yet the \u201cRiders\u201d of the title were also a group of real cops. In 2000, a rookie officer in Oakland named Keith Batt found himself in training under Clarence Mabanag, who collected misconduct complaints \u201clike baseball cards\u201d and worked with a coterie of sadistic officers. Oaklanders accused the Riders of an astonishing range of violent acts, as well as of falsifying reports, planting evidence and using racial slurs. When Winston and BondGraham suspect we may still reserve a shred of sympathy for these men \u2014 who were, after all, facing daily danger in high-crime areas \u2014 we get a detailed account of them shooting dogs. And bragging about it.\n\nTheir fellow officers mostly failed to speak up \u2014 to do so was to risk being labeled a snitch and becoming a target for retaliation. But a month after joining the force, Keith Batt did speak up. (He also quit his job.) Thanks in part to his testimony, some of the Riders were brought to trial on criminal charges. But defense lawyers portrayed them as merely following orders \u201cto be aggressive.\u201d None were convicted. One fled the United States and was reportedly last seen in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. Some jurors may have embraced the idea that the officers suffered from \u201cnoble cause corruption\u201d \u2014 they had gone too far, but only in the service of a good cause. Winston and BondGraham argue that the trials \u201cestablished a narrative inside the department that the Riders were innocent, and that the scandal was really about politicians giving cops marching orders and then abandoning those same officers once their ugly methods became public.\u201d The city of Oakland was already paying out millions in local taxpayer dollars every year to settle misconduct cases. As criminal proceedings against the Riders got underway, a couple of enterprising social justice lawyers also mounted a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 119 people \u2014 all victims, the lawyers claimed, of the officers\u2019 abusive or illegal behavior. The Oakland Police Department settled the case and agreed to make a series of reforms under the supervision of an independent monitor, an arrangement that may soon end after roughly two decades.\n\nJournalists who give crooked cops the book treatment \u2014 most recently in \u201cWe Own This City,\u201d \u201cI Got a Monster\u201d and \u201cJimmy the King\u201d \u2014 tend to look backward at what made scandals possible. Winston and BondGraham spend more time on history than most, drawing a line from Oakland authorities\u2019 racism toward Asian immigrants in the 1800s to their Ku Klux Klan ties in the 1920s and onward to high-profile police killings in the rest of the century. \u201cWhen reforms do happen, they are rarely incorporated into an agency\u2019s culture, which is often driven by a reactionary ethos passed down through generations of rank-and-file cops,\u201d they write. \u201cResistance to change imposed from outsiders, especially civilians, is baked into police culture in the United States.\u201d And yet the authors make a case for civilian oversight by presenting civilians \u2014 civil rights lawyers, community activists, grieving parents of those killed by police \u2014 as the heroes of their stories. While Winston and BondGraham treat some episodes with a granularity that may be of interest only to Bay Area residents, in a way this is a strength of the book: You cannot accuse these reporters of importing outside narratives to fit this community. Every city contemplating the future of its police force could use a book like this. \u201cThe Riders Come Out at Night\u201d includes some familiar names, which serve as anchors for nonlocal readers and reinforce the notion that Oakland\u2019s history is relevant to the national story of 20th-century urban neglect, crime and heavy-handed policing. We learn about the tragic rise and fall of Huey Newton, from Black Panther Party co-founder hounded by the police to crime boss. We learn how Robert Mueller, then the U.S. attorney for Northern California, declined to prosecute the Riders or investigate the department, for reasons that may have had to do with the demographics of the Riders\u2019 victims \u2014 mainly Black Oaklanders with histories of drug use and crime. Finally, we learn how Jerry Brown, the mayor of Oakland during the Riders\u2019 trials, joined 1990s Democrats in promoting policies that \u201cwere even tougher on crimes\u201d than Republicans\u2019 own. The opportunism and hypocrisy are often galling if not surprising, but the authors break newer ground by chronicling what happened after the monitor came in. Other city police departments have faced similar oversight through \u201cconsent decrees,\u201dusually at the behest of the Department of Justice, and their record of success is mixed. In Oakland, even a progressive police chief, working with the outside monitor, failed to transform the department\u2019s internal culture, leading in 2015 to a shocking scandal in which numerous officers sexually exploited the same young woman. One of the officers committed suicide. His wife had died a year earlier, following an altercation with her husband, and while her death was also ruled a suicide, Winston and BondGraham appear to share her family\u2019s skepticism of that explanation. Elsewhere in the book, we see officers violate policy during a traffic stop and manhunt, putting their own lives at risk. These passages underscore a point that isn\u2019t made often enough in our current, polarized moment: Dysfunction and corruption among officers aren\u2019t just bad for the community, they\u2019re bad for the officers themselves. Perhaps this insight may offer hope as we strive for a vision of public safety that doesn\u2019t ask more of police departments than they should be expected to deliver, but does ask more of the public. If we agree the police can\u2019t police themselves, then they need us.",

Trump won in 2020.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAmong the races to watch are governors\u2019 contests in Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi and mayoral elections in Chicago and Philadelphia.\n\nIt might be tempting to focus on the 2024 presidential election now that the midterms are in the rearview mirror, but don\u2019t sleep on 2023: key races for governor, mayor and other offices will be decided. Their outcomes will be closely watched for signs of whether Democrats or Republicans have momentum going into next year\u2019s presidential election and congressional races \u2014 and for what they signal about the influence of former President Donald J. Trump. Virginia and New Jersey have noteworthy state house elections, and in Wisconsin, a state Supreme Court race will determine the balance of power in a body whose conservative majority routinely sides with Republicans. Here\u2019s what to watch: Of the three governors\u2019 races this year, only Kentucky features an incumbent Democrat seeking re-election in a state that Mr. Trump won in 2020. The race also appears packed with the most intrigue. Gov. Andy Beshear won by less than 6,000 votes in 2019, ousting Matt Bevin, the Trump-backed Republican incumbent in the cherry-red state that is home to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate G.O.P. leader.\n\nA growing field of Republicans has ambitions of settling the score in 2023, including Daniel Cameron, who in 2019 became the first Black person to be elected as Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, an office previously held by Mr. Beshear. Mr. Cameron, who is seen as a possible successor to Mr. McConnell, drew attention in 2020 when he announced that a grand jury did not indict two Louisville officers who shot Breonna Taylor. Last June, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Cameron for governor, but there will be competition for the G.O.P. nomination.\n\nKelly Craft, a former ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Trump, is also running. So are Mike Harmon, the state auditor of public accounts, and Ryan Quarles, the state\u2019s agricultural commissioner, and several other Republicans. The primary will be on May 16. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who narrowly won a second term in 2019, is not eligible to run again because of term limits. The open-seat race has tantalized some prominent Republicans, including Jeff Landry, the state\u2019s attorney general, who has declared his candidacy. Two other Republicans weighing entering the race are John Schroder, the state treasurer who has told supporters he will run, and Representative Garret Graves.\n\nThe crowded field includes Representative Jes\u00fas G. Garc\u00eda, a Democrat who is known as Chuy and who was overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term in his Cook County district in November and previously ran unsuccessfully for mayor. In the current race, Ms. Lightfoot has attacked Mr. Garc\u00eda over receiving money for his House campaign from Sam Bankman-Fried, the criminally charged founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Ms. Lightfoot\u2019s other opponents include Kam Buckner, a state legislator; Brandon Johnson, a Cook County commissioner; Sophia King and Roderick T. Sawyer, who both serve on the City Council; Paul Vallas, a former chief executive of Chicago public schools; and Ja\u2019Mal Green, a prominent activist in the city. An open-seat race for mayor in Pennsylvania\u2019s foremost Democratic bastion has attracted an expansive field of candidates. The office is held by Jim Kenney, a Democrat who is not eligible to run again because of term limits. Five members of the City Council have resigned to enter the race, which city rules require. They are Allan Domb, Derek Green, Helen Gym, Cherelle Parker and Maria Qui\u00f1ones S\u00e1nchez.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin wants to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, emboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s repeal last summer of Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old constitutional right to an abortion. His proposal is expected to resonate with Republican lawmakers, who narrowly control the House of Delegates. But it is likely to run into fierce opposition in the Senate, where Democrats are clinging to a slender majority. All seats in both chambers are up for election. Another Mid-Atlantic state to watch is New Jersey, where Republicans made inroads in 2021 despite being in the minority and are seeking to build on those gains.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nSeeking to shut down the nation\u2019s largest death row, the governor is proceeding with a mix of conviction and caution.\n\nIn 2022, a remarkable thing happened: In the heat of an election in which Republicans seized on the public\u2019s fears of crime, support for capital punishment barely moved, if at all. Murders increased across the United States in 2020 and 2021, and Americans were clearly worried about what they were hearing. According to Gallup\u2019s annual crime survey, 78 percent of the public said there was more crime in the U.S., approaching levels not seen since the 1990s. And when it came to local crime, the public\u2019s concern reached a height unmatched in Gallup\u2019s data since 1972. The percentage of Americans who said they at least occasionally feared being murdered jumped by seven percentage points. But when Gallup asked respondents if they favored the death penalty for people convicted of murder, the number ticked up by a single point, a statistically insignificant blip.\n\nThat was new; in the past, public support for capital punishment has tended to rise along with fears about crime. In 1994, 80 percent of Americans backed the death penalty for murder; by 2022, only 55 percent did, according to Gallup. And among Republicans, the Pew Research Center found, the share of those supporting death sentences for murder convictions dropped by seven points in the two years before 2021. Those who track trends in capital punishment saw this divergence as a hopeful sign that declining public support for the practice, increasingly viewed as morally indefensible, prone to mistakes and racially biased, might be irreversible. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing defies all conventional political wisdom,\u201d said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. Coming after Donald Trump revived the federal death penalty in 2020 \u2014 his administration executed 13 people, the most of any president in a year since Grover Cleveland \u2014 it looks like a repudiation. In practice, capital punishment is on the wane. The five-year average of new death sentences reached just 26.6 a year, a 50-year low, Dunham\u2019s recently published annual report documented. The five-year average of executions also dropped to 18.6 a year, a 30-year low. Since peaking at 98 in 1999, executions have dropped by 82 percent. Geographically, the death penalty\u2019s retreat is stark. Thirty-seven states have abolished the death penalty altogether or have not executed anyone in at least a decade \u2014 and those that are still actively carrying it out are concentrated in the South.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Dunham said, \u201cis the geographic constriction of capital punishment to where it exists almost exclusively in states of the former Confederacy.\u201d The state with the most prisoners on death row, however, is deep-blue California \u2014 where the death penalty exists in a state of suspended animation. As of December, there were still 692 people on death row in California, more than twice as many as in Florida, which had the second-most prisoners awaiting execution. Prosecutors and juries in California have continued sentencing people to death \u2014 mostly in a few conservative counties, a handful each year \u2014 even though the state has not executed anyone since 2006. California voters have often seemed unsure what to do with this state of affairs. In 2012 and 2016, they rejected ballot measures to end the death penalty. And in 2016, they instead approved a rival proposal backed by law enforcement groups that would speed up executions, Proposition 66. This verdict presented Gov. Gavin Newsom with a conundrum when he entered office in 2019. During his first campaign, he invoked his Jesuit upbringing, and seemed haunted by the prospect of having to sign a death warrant. But his predecessor, Jerry Brown, had left office with 737 prisoners still on death row. California voters had spoken, and mounting another ballot initiative to end the death penalty would be an expensive and uncertain prospect. Newsom decided to freeze the practice instead. \u201cI will not oversee the execution of any person while governor,\u201d he declared as he announced a moratorium. He called the death penalty a \u201cfailure\u201d that discriminated against people of color, had \u201cno public safety value\u201d and \u201cwasted billions of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Newsom has been comfortably re-elected despite Republican attempts to highlight rising murder rates in California; there\u2019s no evidence that he paid any political price for his death-penalty gamble. But he also didn\u2019t take the bolder action some capital punishment opponents wanted. Public opinion on the issue remains murky: A poll conducted in May 2021 found that 44 percent of the state\u2019s voters would vote to repeal the death penalty, while just 35 percent would vote no. But 21 percent were undecided, suggesting room for interpretation. \u201cThe state runs progressive on every issue, but on the death penalty, public opinion has been stubbornly right-leaning,\u201d said David Atkins, a Democratic National Committee member from California. \u201cSo I think Newsom is acting carefully.\u201d In November 2021, in a scathing 39-page report, a state panel set up by the California Legislature called for outright abolition. \u201cRecent efforts to improve, simplify and expedite California\u2019s system of capital punishment have failed to accomplish their stated goals and may have made things even worse,\u201d it found. Recognizing that ending the death penalty would be \u201cdifficult,\u201d the report made seven recommendations for reducing the death-row population, including granting clemency to inmates. One of its novel proposals, amending the law to allow death-row defendants to retroactively challenge their sentences as racially biased, went into effect on Jan. 1. Newsom took another step last January, when he announced plans to dismantle the death-row section at San Quentin State Prison and move its prisoners into other maximum-security facilities. But that has been slow going, complicated in part by the mental-health needs of many condemned inmates.\n\nHe now faces renewed calls from abolition advocates to follow the example of Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, who commuted the sentences of all 17 people on the state\u2019s death row during her final weeks in office. And he\u2019s clearly thinking about it. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated in California, for many different reasons, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s long been considered,\u201d the governor told reporters in Sacramento recently when asked about commuting sentences. That\u2019s true: Many of those on death row also have other felony convictions, so even if Newsom granted them clemency, the California Supreme Court would have to review each one. Issuing commutations in small batches could be a painstaking and legally risky process \u2014 and no less politically thorny than simply converting every death sentence to life in prison, as Oregon\u2019s Brown did. For that reason, those pushing clemency are urging Newsom to go all the way, and sooner rather than later. Cassandra Stubbs, the director of the Capital Punishment Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that activists were \u201cthrilled\u201d when Newsom announced his moratorium. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cof course that\u2019s not enough.\u201d Abolitionists in California are willing to grant the governor space to think about it, however. A recent editorial in The Los Angeles Times on the death penalty made no specific demand of Newsom, and there\u2019s little sign that he\u2019s under real political pressure to act. With no executions happening, the issue is rarely in the news. Activists said they appreciated the incremental steps Newsom had taken, and offered to help find a path forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope that he will move forward with universal clemency in his final term,\u201d said Natasha Minsker, a death penalty opponent who advises Smart Justice California, an advocacy group. \u201cWe want to support him.\u201d As he weighs any future ambitions \u2014 and Newsom has said he has \u201csubzero\u201d interest in the presidency, despite some indications last year that he was contemplating the idea \u2014 he might be considering the fact that America\u2019s national politics on capital punishment are still less forgiving than California\u2019s.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s mixed actions on the federal death penalty offer one possible clue to how national Democrats see the issue. Although his Justice Department imposed a moratorium on federal executions in 2021, and quietly reversed the government\u2019s calls for capital punishment in a dozen cases, it backed the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber. \u201cDeath penalty cases always come with tragic stories,\u201d said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who directs the Project for the Innocent at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cIf Newsom stays in politics, he\u2019s going to have to defend the decisions he makes.\u201d\n\u2022 None President Biden on Sunday made his first visit to the border since taking office, Michael Shear and Edgar Sandoval write, visiting El Paso as it is \u201cswamped by migrants amid a historic surge in illegal immigration and anger from both parties about how he is handling it.\u201d\n\u2022 None A special grand jury investigating Donald Trump and his allies for election interference in Georgia after the 2020 contest has concluded its work, but it is not yet clear if criminal charges will be brought, Richard Fausset and Danny Hakim report.\n\u2022 None In his Sidebar column, our Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak writes about how the justices will hear arguments this spring about the constitutionality of \u201ca curious law that makes it a crime to \u2018encourage\u2019 unauthorized immigrants to come to or stay in the United States.\u201d Thank you for reading On Politics, and for being a subscriber to The New York Times. \u2014 Blake Read past editions of the newsletter here.

            "content": "A volunteer directing a boat of refugees as they arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos in 2015.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTwo dozen aid workers, including the Syrian refugee-turned-activist Sara Mardini, went on trial on Tuesday on charges of espionage over their roles in helping migrants after they arrived in Greece in the wake of Europe\u2019s migration crisis of 2015 and 2016. The case is being heard in a court on Lesbos, the Greek island that was at the forefront of the crisis, and comes as Greece\u2019s conservative government toughens its stance on migration and on groups working with migrants, in line with a hardening climate in Europe. Bracing for general elections before the summer, the government has vowed to avert a repeat of the crisis, which led to more than a million Europe-bound migrants streaming through Greece and straining the country\u2019s resources. Officials have pledged to fortify the northern land border with Turkey by extending a fence and adding guards. Tensions between Greece and Turkey have been rising in recent months over a series of issues, including territorial disputes and migration, raising the specter of a conflict between the two neighbors, who have long had an uneasy relationship.\n\nGreece\u2019s judiciary has also cracked down on nongovernmental organizations that work with migrants. In addition to the people on trial this week, the heads of two other groups, the Greek Helsinki Monitor and the Aegean Boat Report, face criminal charges of facilitating the illegal entry of migrants and membership of a criminal organization. Amnesty International, the rights group, has called the case against Ms. Mardini and her co-defendants \u201cfarcical,\u201d pointing to what it called a \u201cpeak\u201d in efforts by the Greek authorities to criminalize NGOs. \u201cThe Greek government has tried to deter humanitarian action by various means,\u201d Amnesty\u2019s director for Europe, Nils Muiznieks, said. \u201cThe outcome of the trial will be an important signal to others doing similar work,\u201d he added. The 24 defendants being tried on Lesbos are either members of or volunteers with an NGO, the Emergency Response Center International. They include Ms. Mardini, who now lives in Berlin and was not in court on Tuesday. Ms. Mardini is a sister of the Olympic swimmer Yusra Mardini. The sisters captured international attention in 2015 after fleeing the war in Syria and dragging their refugee boat to safety, a story made into a film last year.\n\nAfter receiving asylum in Germany, Sara Mardini returned to Greece in 2016 to help other migrants. She was arrested two years later and detained in a high-security Athens prison for more than three months. A police investigation found that she and other defendants had monitored Greek Coast Guard radio channels and vessels and used a vehicle with fake military license plates to enter restricted-access areas on Lesbos.\n\nIf found guilty of the charges, including espionage and forgery, Ms. Mardini and the 23 other aid workers would each face up to eight years in prison. Greece\u2019s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, would not comment because the trial is underway, as is a judicial investigation of the same defendants over accusations of crimes including human smuggling and money laundering, which carry longer sentences. Clio Papapantoleon, a human rights lawyer who represents Ms. Mardini and another defendant, Sean Binder, an Irish citizen, said there was no incriminating evidence for any of the offenses they had been charged with or accused of and that they were basically being held hostage. \u201cThe case was used as an example to stop other young people thinking of coming to Greece to help and join that big wave of solidarity,\u201d Ms. Papapantoleon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s totally unsubstantiated.\u201d\n\nA 2021 European Parliament report called it \u201cthe largest case of criminalization of solidarity in Europe.\u201d Mr. Muiznieks of Amnesty International said, \u201cHelping people at risk of drowning in one of the deadliest sea routes in Europe and assisting them on the shoreline is not a crime.\u201d The trial has underlined the Greek authorities\u2019 commitment to deterring humanitarian assistance to migrants, Mr. Muiznieks added, \u201csomething which we see in a number of European countries.\u201d The government of Italy, a country that is another popular entry point for Europe-bound migrants, has also taken a harder line on NGOs. Its new far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, recently introduced stricter rules for charities that rescue migrants at sea. Greece, since tightening the rules governing the operation of NGOs in 2020, has been increasingly at loggerheads with such groups. Some of them have been instrumental in documenting the expulsion of migrants without due process, which are called \u201cpushbacks\u201d by Greece. Frontex, the European Union agency charged with monitoring borders, has been accused of covering up Greece\u2019s efforts to expel the migrants. Some analysts say the crackdown on NGOs is fueled by Greece\u2019s difficult relationship with Turkey. \u201cThere is a Cold War taking place in the Aegean today and refugees are weaponized by Turkey,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a professor of legal theory at the University of Athens. \u201cBut their exploitation by Turkey does not diminish their predicament, and the volunteers of most NGOs are only interested in the humanitarian tragedy.\u201d Ms. Mardini, in a recent interview, described her volunteer work in Greece as \u201ca passion.\u201d \u201cI thought I could offer something there,\u201d she said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nExtreme weather has plagued many parts of the country this fall and winter. But few places have been as ravaged by the changing climate these last weeks as California.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 An unrelenting series of pounding storms over at least 11 days has left no part of California untouched \u2014 flooding towns from north to south, loading inland mountains with snow and transforming the often dry Los Angeles River into a raging channel. At least 17 people have died in the downpours, which started in late December and stretched into the new year. And more rain is expected. As of Tuesday morning, amid the latest round of rain, nearly 100,000 residents were under evacuation orders or warnings, state officials said, and about 220,000 utility customers were without power. More than 400 public and charter schools were closed. Hail pelted San Francisco, which was under a flood warning. In Central California, rescuers searched for a 5-year-old boy who was swept out of his mother\u2019s arms as their car was swamped by fast-rising floodwaters on the way to school. Extreme weather has plagued many parts of the country this fall and winter \u2014 deep freezes, hurricane-like blizzards, tornadoes, drastic temperature swings. But few places have been as savaged by the changing climate these last weeks as California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a marathon,\u201d said Paul Horvat, the emergency services manager for Santa Cruz. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to pace ourselves because we know this can go on and on and on for a while.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve never really seen this many rainstorms, big ones, one after another, in my career.\u201d The parade of storms introduced Americans to yet another new term in the ever-expanding weather lexicon: the atmospheric river, a plume of concentrated moisture at the altitude where airplanes often fly. This year, those plumes have streamed in from over the Pacific at a particularly relentless pace. \u201cNearly all of California has seen much above average rainfall totals over the past several weeks, with totals 400 to 600 percent above average values,\u201d forecasters with the Weather Prediction Center wrote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very much in the middle of this, we\u2019re not on a downhill trajectory at all,\u201d said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. He said officials remained concerned about coming storms \u201cjust because of the sheer volume of water that\u2019s in the creeks and within the landscape.\u201d In Los Angeles, where the infrastructure is notoriously fragile in the face of heavy rain or floods, some of the scenes have been surreal. On Monday, a sinkhole in the suburban Chatsworth neighborhood swallowed two cars. And on Tuesday, commuters were able to splash their way through a pedestrian tunnel at Union Station, which flooded with a few inches of water. Yet the metro area pressed on with the College Football Playoff on Monday at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood \u2014 where some fans got wet \u2014 and with the televised return of the Golden Globes awards show on Tuesday night in Beverly Hills. In Montecito, where residents were ordered to evacuate on Monday, the air was filled with the smell of mud and the low, distant sound of small boulders rumbling through fast-flowing creeks. Most businesses were closed, and usually busy streets were largely empty. Montecito, a community north of Los Angeles near Santa Barbara, is a popular haven for celebrities, including Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex; Oprah Winfrey; and Ellen DeGeneres, who posted a video on Twitter on Monday of a raging creek behind her house that she said \u201cnever flows, ever.\u201d\n\nIn Gualala, a small town on the northern coast, Robin Applegarth, 71, had to leave her home after the power went out almost a week ago. The restoration date has been delayed three times already, she said, and more rain and wind are in the forecast. So she and her husband have checked into a hotel in Santa Rosa, about 70 miles southeast. \u201cIt\u2019s a very resilient group of people who live along the Northern California coast,\u201d Ms. Applegarth said. But, she added, \u201cNone of us expected it to go on this long.\u201d The ripple of storms has produced uneven impacts. Last week, strong winds and pelting rain brought chaos to the Bay Area. This week, the oceanside counties of Santa Cruz, Monterey and Santa Barbara, all of which lie between San Francisco and Los Angeles, have borne the brunt of the impact. But just about every community in California has been jolted by the storms in one way or another. Extra snow fell in the Sierra Nevada last week. Heavy winds toppled power lines in Sacramento this weekend. Mudslides mucked up Los Angeles on Tuesday. Public transportation systems in major cities have been snarled, and roads have been temporarily shuttered just about everywhere, from the mountains to the valleys to the coast. In Malibu, a large boulder blocked a canyon road. In Fresno, a hillside crumbled onto a highway. And multiple stretches of the well-traveled Route 101 were turned into rivers.\n\nThe land is especially vulnerable in places that have been scorched by wildfires or droughts, leaving behind scars that are conducive to landslides. The storms are yet another example of how climate change has upended life in the nation\u2019s most populous state. It\u2019s been ravaged by expanding seasons of wildfires and years of drought, both of which have left behind scars that leave the land unmoored and prone to landslides. In an atmosphere heated by the burning of fossil fuels, the warmer air can hold more moisture. That means storms in many places, California included, are more likely to be wetter and more intense because of climate change. Over the past two days, more than a foot of rain has been recorded across portions of coastal California. And seven more inches of rain could fall in many parts of the state over the next several days, the National Weather Service said, as yet another \u201cenormous cyclone\u201d that is forming off the coast slams areas of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday. That northward shift could give other areas of the state a break, David Novak, the director of the Weather Prediction Center, said on Tuesday, adding that the storm system was threatening the state this weekend but didn\u2019t look as strong.\n\n\u201cGradually, it looks like we\u2019ll have a pattern change that will allow the spigot to turn off,\u201d he said. But even a weak atmospheric river with mild precipitation can cause problems given California\u2019s saturated ground. Forecasts suggested on Tuesday that storm activity over California could taper off after the middle of next week. All told, experts say, the cost of the damage done by the storms could top $1 billion \u2014 an ominous start to the new year, especially since 2022 was already one of the worst on record for large-scale weather and climate disasters around the United States, according to data released on Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission fined Steve Easterbrook for lack of disclosure about the circumstances behind his firing in 2019.\n\nThree years after being fired as McDonald\u2019s C.E.O. over what was eventually revealed as several inappropriate personal relationships with employees, Steve Easterbrook on Monday agreed to punishments from the S.E.C. over how his termination played out. The agency\u2019s accusations are a major milestone in a scandal that gripped corporate America, as the fast-food giant accused its former chief of misleading internal investigators. But they\u2019re also the latest sign of how the S.E.C. is seeking to hold companies to account for what they do \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 reveal to investors. The S.E.C.\u2019s case revolved around disclosure. The regulator said Easterbrook misled investors about the reasons for his termination. McDonald\u2019s initially said he was terminated \u201cwithout cause\u201d for having what he said was a consensual relationship with an employee, and allowed him to leave with a separation package worth about $40 million. The company, however, later uncovered other relationships that Easterbrook hadn\u2019t disclosed and sued him. \u201cBy allegedly concealing the extent of his misconduct during the company\u2019s internal investigation, Easterbrook broke that trust with \u2014 and ultimately misled \u2014 shareholders,\u201d Gurbir Grewal, the director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said in a statement.\n\nEasterbrook will be barred from serving as a public company executive or director for five years, and will also pay a $400,000 fine. McDonald\u2019s didn\u2019t pay a penalty because it cooperated with the S.E.C. For its part, the company noted that it had already taken action against Easterbrook, including firing him and clawing back compensation. The S.E.C.\u2019s move drew criticism from within. The regulator\u2019s two Republican commissioners said the agency appeared to question expanding its regulatory powers through enforcement. \u201cThe order casts McDonald\u2019s, the victim of Mr. Easterbrook\u2019s deception, as a securities law violator through a novel interpretation of the Commission\u2019s expansive executive compensation disclosure requirements,\u201d they said. It\u2019s the latest instance of criticism facing federal regulators over whether they\u2019re overstepping their bounds by effectively writing new rules. Microsoft reportedly weighs a $10 billion investment in the parent of ChatGPT. The tech giant is in talks to pour more money into OpenAI, along with other venture investors, according to Semafor. Microsoft had previously invested in OpenAI and is said to be planning to incorporate ChatGPT into products like its Bing search engine.\n\nHouse Republicans eke out another legislative win. They narrowly approved an overhaul of the House\u2019s operating rules, overcoming concerns by moderates about concessions made to the hard right to help Speaker Kevin McCarthy clinch his job. Republicans also voted to cut funding for the I.R.S., but the move is unlikely to pass the Senate. Disney requires employees to work in the office four days a week. The edict by Bob Iger, the company\u2019s newly returned C.E.O., is a relatively strict return-to-office policy compared with most in corporate America. It\u2019s among the many big overhauls that Iger is likely to make at Disney, which may also include layoffs. Another Sam Bankman-Fried associate reportedly meets with prosecutors. Nishad Singh, who previously led engineering at FTX, has held talks over a potential cooperation agreement with the Justice Department, according to Bloomberg. If he secures a deal, he would join Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang in working against Bankman-Fried. The F.T.C.\u2019s proposal to ban noncompete agreements is among the agency\u2019s most sweeping moves in recent years, and it would have far-reaching consequences if it takes effect. But the move has also given business lobbyists an opportunity: a chance to challenge the agency\u2019s power in court. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this moment, whether it was this issue or another,\u201d Sean Heather, a senior vice president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told DealBook. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the subject matter, but we don\u2019t think they have the authority.\u201d A big question is whether Congress gave the F.T.C. this authority. Some skeptics \u2014 including Noah Phillips, a Republican former commissioner at the regulator \u2014 argue that lawmakers didn\u2019t give the agency the power to write new rules.\n\nBut antitrust experts note that a 1973 federal court decision \u2014 National Petroleum Refiners Association v. F.T.C. \u2014 did grant rule-making power. That legal decision allowed it to require businesses to post octane ratings on gas pumps. The rule, still in place today, was able to stand because it addressed a public harm, and Congress didn\u2019t explicitly limit the F.T.C.\u2019s rule-making power. But a lot has changed since then. Antitrust experts across the political spectrum say courts now don\u2019t tend to find agency authority where it\u2019s not explicitly granted. Last June, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority ruled in West Virginia v. E.P.A. that the environmental agency overstepped its authority by creating emissions regulations that touch on \u201cmajor questions\u201d with big economic consequences. That \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d had once been considered a fringe conservative legal position. Now, however, it\u2019s become a key part of litigation strategy for industrial groups looking to fight new regulatory rules. Even supporters of the F.T.C.\u2019s move are wary. The regulator will most likely modify its proposal based on public comments made over a 60-day period, so no final rule will be issued for some time. Even then, whatever the agency does must still pass legal muster. \u201cThat might be an uphill battle, given the way judges \u2014 particularly conservative judges \u2014 think,\u201d Jon Leibowitz, a Democratic former F.T.C. chair, told DealBook. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Hail Mary, but it\u2019s definitely a shot down the field.\u201d Moments ago, Bed Bath & Beyond reported earnings, and there\u2019s one question on nearly everyone\u2019s mind: Can the retailer avoid bankruptcy after raising its own doubts about its financial health?\n\nThe company is looking for new capital, and its share price surged Monday on investor speculation that it could be an acquisition target. Given all of that, it\u2019s worth analyzing how the home goods retailer got into this position. Bed Bath & Beyond isn\u2019t a typical retailer debt story. Most recent retail bankruptcies came after a boom in private equity deals in the sector over the previous decade. The acquisitions of companies like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the shoe chain Payless and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus saddled them with debt, on the assumption that they could rely on steady cash flow to kick-start growth. But those mountains of debt became a noose that left those retailers unable to compete against the rise of Amazon. But Bed Bath & Beyond started taking on significant debt in 2014, selling $1.5 billion in bonds to buy back stock, which one analyst described at the time as a \u201cseminal event.\u201d. (It was still far less than what would be attached to a typical leveraged buyout, however.) Thanks to cheap credit and the company\u2019s status as a retail giant, it got a good deal on that debt: Those bonds had maturation dates of 10, 20 and 30 years with interest rates of 3.8 percent, 4.9 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, according to James Gellert, the C.E.O. of the financial analytics firm RapidRatings. Those were terms Bed Bath & Beyond could \u201conly dream of\u201d at any other time, Gellert told DealBook.\n\nRising competition and disappointing sales have hammered the company. While the retailer once stood strongly on its own after its competitor Linens \u2019n Things collapsed, management struggled to figure out the right strategy to compete with Kohl\u2019s, Amazon and Target. Its supply chain management was hit hard by a shopping shift brought on by the pandemic. As a result, delivery times got extended, and costs increased. As its earnings disappeared, cash went to plugging its losses and its leverage skyrocketed. Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization jumped to 6.19 in 2020 from 1.95 in 2019. \u201cUltimately, if you look at the debt level,\u201d said Christina Boni, a senior vice president of Corporate Finance at Moody\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s more a function of the decline in profitability, more than anything else.\u201d Taking on more leverage hasn\u2019t solved the problem. Bed Bath & Beyond tapped the debt market again in August, giving it a lifeline, and the hope that vendors would have enough confidence in the company to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday season. But it\u2019s still struggled in recent months to procure the products customers wanted, and to sell enough of what it had. The retailer, whose stock market capitalization has dropped to $190 million from a peak of $17 billion in 2013, could skip debt payments on Feb. 1. \u201cMultiple paths are being explored, and we are determining our next steps thoroughly, and in a timely manner,\u201d Susan Gove, the C.E.O. who launched a turnaround plan just months ago, said this morning.\n\nA cost-of-living crisis, recession fears and a war raging on its eastern border: At first glance, Europe would hardly seem to be a go-to region for investors. But Wall Street increasingly sees an opportunity \u2014 particularly when compared with the U.S. The latest economic data point to a shallow downturn. Investors got another spurt of upbeat news on Monday, with eurozone unemployment hitting a record low and factory output rising in Germany, the engine of the bloc\u2019s economy. Analysts are taking note. Last week, Citigroup raised its rating on European equities to overweight, saying valuations were relatively cheap. At the same time, they cut their 2023 outlook on U.S. stocks to underweight for the opposite reason: American shares are still too expensive. Investors got the message months ago. European stocks have been outperforming American equities for several months. The benchmark Pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 10 percent last quarter and Germany\u2019s DAX gained nearly 15 percent. At the same time, the S&P 500 climbed 7.5 percent. Companies on both sides of the Atlantic are facing similar headwinds. Inflation remains at a multi-decade high, central banks are raising interest rates, recession seems likely, and that will probably torpedo corporate profits. Goldman Sachs predicts earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will flatline this year and Liberum Capital forecasts a volley of downgrades. Europe may be over the worst and that\u2019s enough for investors. This week, Goldman Sachs upgraded its forecast on eurozone G.D.P. to show meager growth for 2023, or a year-on-year gain of 0.6 percent versus an earlier prediction of a 0.1 percent slide. One big reason: energy prices have been falling across the bloc, with natural gas futures hitting a 12-month low as warmer winter temperatures have cooled off demand.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe migration tide loomed large at the president\u2019s summit meeting with the leaders of Mexico and Canada. All three want to steer away from the rancor of the Trump years.\n\nIn Mexico, Biden Looks for Help With Migrants and Stronger Partnership\n\nFollow our live coverage of Biden\u2019s visit to Mexico to meet North American leaders. MEXICO CITY \u2014 President Biden was under growing political pressure Monday to confront the surge of undocumented migrants at the southern border as he began two days of diplomacy in Mexico City intended to secure more help from Mexico to stem the tide of people fleeing toward the United States. Mr. Biden is also looking for more cooperation from Mexico in the fight against drug trafficking, and for the resolution of a dispute over the Mexican government\u2019s financial support for its energy industries. He began those conversations on Monday evening with a one-on-one meeting with the country\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the second time that the two leaders have met in person since Mr. Biden took office two years ago. In remarks before his meeting, Mr. Biden said that the United States and Mexico \u201chave to continue to build and contribute to democratic institutions in the hemisphere.\u201d Both countries, he said, are \u201cat one of those inflection points.\u201d Officials on both sides of the border have set modest goals for the North American Leaders Summit between Mr. Biden, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada. No agreements are expected on immigration, for instance, only commitments to work in that direction.\n\nBut officials also said that specific deals at the short gathering were less important than a broader mission: cementing the return of a North American partnership based on cooperation and shared interests rather than the intimidation and conflict that marked the Trump years. It has been three and a half years since President Donald J. Trump threatened Mexico with far-reaching tariffs and nearly five years since Mr. Trump angrily tore up an agreement with the Group of 7 countries during a summit in Canada. Now, with Mr. Biden as president, officials in all three countries say a stronger relationship is vital to improving supply chains and weathering economic headwinds. \u201cA larger economic vision of North America that involves high labor standards, better environmental standards and as much positively reinforcing economic activity as possible,\u201d was how Jake Sullivan, the administration\u2019s national security adviser, described what Mr. Biden hopes to accomplish at the summit.\n\nThe lack of specific, aggressive action items has frustrated some business leaders in the United States, who said there are economic disputes between the three countries that need to be resolved soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not sufficient for leaders to get just together,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the Executive Vice President and head of international affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we see action and transformational change in the way that governments work with the private sector.\u201d Still, confronting migration is at the top of the agenda for the leaders here, according to officials with all three governments, even if major policy announcements are unlikely. Talks on migration are constant, with a U.S. official saying that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is in regular touch with Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine continue to wreak havoc on global supply chains. Inflation and political instability have produced a hunger crisis of extreme proportions in Latin America and the Caribbean. And the mass movement of people across the hemisphere continues to challenge governments throughout the Americas. Mr. Biden has been under fire at home from Democrats and Republicans to deal with record numbers of migrants at the southwest border. Last week, the Biden administration said Mexico had agreed to accept a significant increase, to 30,000 per month, in the number of migrants being swiftly expelled by the United States.\n\nThe Mexican government, along with immigrant advocates in the United States, has denounced a policy the Biden administration proposed last week that would make asylum very difficult to obtain for migrants arriving from a \u201csafe third country,\u201d usually Mexico, without first seeking refuge there. On Saturday, Roberto Velasco, the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s chief officer for North America, called the idea \u201ca red line for us\u201d because it could mean far more migrants in Mexico. Mexico has not asked the United States for any financial support to deal with the influx of migrants, believing that doing so would limit the country\u2019s autonomy. But Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is facing political pressures of his own inside Mexico, where some are frustrated by the large number of migrants from elsewhere in the region. While announcing that it is cracking down on asylum claims, the Biden administration also said it would open more pathways for people to migrate legally to the United States \u2014 a change Mexico had been seeking. \u201cObviously it also decreases the pressure on our own systems and our own country in terms of these very large flows of people that we\u2019ve been seeing in the past years,\u201d Mr. Velasco said.\n\nThe move infuriated the Mexican military and prompted so much outrage within Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government that the American authorities eventually released the official and returned him to Mexico. Mexico delayed for months the granting of visas to several agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and moved to make it harder for agents already in the country to operate normally. A law passed at the end of 2020 required foreign agents to share information with the Mexican government and removed their diplomatic immunity. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, meanwhile, has presided over one of the most violent periods in Mexico\u2019s recent history. While the country\u2019s government last week arrested Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez \u2014 the son of the infamous drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known as El Chapo \u2014 Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has removed fewer drug cartel chiefs and has done less to dismantle organized criminal groups than his predecessors, analysts say. \u201cThe Mexican government is not making it a priority to crack down on the supply side of the drug problem,\u201d said David Shirk, director of the Justice in Mexico program at the University of San Diego.\n\nDuring their meeting on Monday, the two presidents also began potentially tense conversations about trade conflicts between their countries that still loom large. Mr. Biden confronted Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador about steps the Mexican president has taken to strengthen the dominance of Mexico\u2019s two main state-owned energy companies \u2014 the Federal Electricity Commission, or CFE, and the oil and gas company Pemex. Executives of American energy companies believe that the Mexican actions put American companies at a disadvantage in ways not allowed under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free-trade pact that was signed two years ago. Mr. Sullivan said on Monday that the administration could decide to formalize its complaints against Mexico if an agreement is not reached by the two leaders this week. \u201cWe think consultations have helped clarify both the nature of U.S. concerns and have identified some potential pathways forward,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Canada has joined the United States in protesting Mexico\u2019s energy policies, even as it has increased investments in Mexico in recent years. But experts say that Canada enjoys little leverage over Mexico, and officials said Mr. Trudeau was expected to tread lightly in pressing Canada\u2019s economic interests at the summit.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe people who will be running the House of Representatives for the next two years \u2014 a group that does not, as far as anyone can tell, include Kevin McCarthy, who seems set to be speaker in name only \u2014 believe a number of untrue things. Many, perhaps most, believe that the 2020 election was stolen, or at least that Joe Biden is somehow not the legitimate president. Many believe that Covid vaccines do more harm than good, a belief that has contributed to thousands of excess deaths among Republican partisans. Quite a few either subscribe to or are at least friendly to beliefs of the QAnon cult, which claims that the world is run by a vast conspiracy of pedophiles.\n\nAnd just about all of them, again as far as I can tell, believe that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape, with the federal government at great risk of going bankrupt. You\u2019ve probably read a lot about the political delusions of Republican extremists \u2014 and these days a vast majority of Republicans in the House are either extremists or opportunists willing to go along with whatever the extremists want. It\u2019s important, however, to realize that G.O.P. economic views are almost as divorced from reality as their political fantasies are. Let\u2019s talk first about the current state of the U.S. economy. Republicans have spent much of the past year screaming about a \u201cBiden recession.\u201d And to be fair, many private forecasters do expect recent interest rate increases to cause slowing growth and rising unemployment this year \u2014 although I\u2019m hearing growing talk about the possibility of a \u201csoft landing\u201d that might breach the Sahm rule for recessions (a half-point rise in the unemployment rate) but won\u2019t feel like a severe slump. One thing is for sure, however: There wasn\u2019t a recession in 2022. Indeed, the U.S. economy ended the year with continuing strong job growth and the unemployment rate all the way back down to what it was before Covid. What about inflation? The price surge of 2021-22, coming after decades of low inflation, was a nasty shock, and I don\u2019t want to minimize either the size of that shock or the extent to which many economists, myself included, failed to see it coming. Republicans, it goes without saying, tried to make inflation, which they attributed to excessive federal spending, a central theme of the midterm elections.\n\nBut have they noticed that inflation has been coming down? Have any prominent Republicans even acknowledged the changing situation? The numbers are really striking. Over the year ending in November (the most recent data available), the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1 percent. But inflation ran at an annual rate of only 4.8 percent over the past six months, 3.6 percent over the past three months and 1.2 percent in November. True, inflation has been held down in part by events that probably won\u2019t be repeated, like the plunge in gasoline prices over the second half of 2022. On the other hand, there\u2019s good reason to believe that housing inflation \u2014 which accounts for about a third of the Consumer Price Index \u2014 has declined sharply, but that this decline isn\u2019t yet reflected in official statistics. Add in the latest data on wages, which were seriously encouraging, and a reasonable estimate is that we\u2019ve regained full employment with underlying inflation only a point or two above prepandemic levels. That\u2019s not a perfect situation, and squeezing out the remaining inflation may (or may not!) be hard, but it\u2019s hardly a picture of catastrophe. For what it\u2019s worth, financial markets have basically declared the inflation threat over: They\u2019re implicitly predicting roughly 2 percent inflation as far as the eye can see. They\u2019re also willing to buy federal debt at interest rates that are up a bit but still low by historical standards, showing no hint of concerns about U.S. solvency. Still, Republicans are determined to see economic and fiscal disaster, and as always when Democrats hold the White House, they\u2019re insisting that we must take drastic action to balance the budget. That is, after we deal with their first priority: depriving the Internal Revenue Service of the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax cheats.\n\nAnyway, as usual the G.O.P. is insisting that the budget can and must be balanced entirely by cutting spending. And as usual this insistence runs up against the reality that spending cuts that big would be politically impossible. In fact, they\u2019d probably be politically impossible even if Republicans managed to destroy democracy completely, which some of them seem to want. For the federal government is, as an old line puts it, basically an insurance company with an army. Other than military spending \u2014 only a small fraction of which, even now, goes to defending democracy in Ukraine \u2014 federal dollars mainly go to retirement and health care programs on which scores of millions of Americans, including many Republicans, depend. So the new House majority is living in a fantasy world, insisting on a completely unworkable solution to a largely imaginary crisis. Unfortunately, as we learned on Jan. 6, 2021, political fantasies can have dire real-world consequences.",

It comes out on Tuesday.\n\nSapphire Rapids is the code name for a new Intel microprocessor, shown here, which faced bumps during its development.\n\nLast May, Sandra Rivera, a top executive at the chip giant Intel, got some alarming news. Engineers had worked for more than five years to develop a powerful new microprocessor to carry out computing chores in data centers and were confident they had finally gotten the product right. But signs of a potentially serious technical flaw surfaced during a regular morning meeting to discuss the project. The issue was so troublesome that Sapphire Rapids, the code name for the microprocessor, had to be delayed \u2014 the latest in a series of setbacks for one of Intel\u2019s most important products in years. \u201cWe were pretty dejected,\u201d said Ms. Rivera, an executive vice president in charge of Intel\u2019s data center and artificial intelligence group. \u201cIt was a painful decision.\u201d The launch of Sapphire Rapids wound up being pushed from mid-2022 to Tuesday, nearly two years later than once expected. The lengthy development of the product \u2014 which combines four chips in one package \u2014 underscores some of the challenges facing a turnaround effort at Intel when the United States is trying to assert its dominance in the foundational computer technology.\n\nSince the 1970s, Intel has been a leading player in the small slices of silicon that run most electronic devices, best known for a variety called microprocessors, which act as electronic brains in most computers. But the Silicon Valley company in recent years lost its longtime lead in manufacturing technology, which helps determine how fast chips can compute. Patrick Gelsinger, who became Intel\u2019s chief executive in 2021, has vowed to restore its manufacturing edge and build new U.S. factories. He was a leading figure as Congress debated and passed legislation in the summer to reduce U.S. dependence on chip manufacturing in Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. The bumpy development of Sapphire Rapids has implications for whether Intel can rebound to deliver future chips on time. That\u2019s an issue that could affect scores of computer makers and cloud service providers, not to mention the millions of consumers who tap into online services likely to be powered by Intel technology. \u201cWhat we want is a stable cadence that is predictable,\u201d said Kirk Skaugen, the executive vice president leading server sales at Lenovo, a Chinese company that is planning 25 new systems based on the new processor. \u201cSapphire Rapids is the start of a journey.\u201d\n\nAt an online event on Tuesday to discuss Sapphire Rapids, which is named after a portion of the Colorado River, Intel customers described plans to use the processor, which they said would bring particular benefits for artificial intelligence tasks. The product, formally called the 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor, was introduced along with another delayed addition to the Xeon chip family. That product, formerly code-named Ponte Vecchio, was designed to accelerate special-purpose jobs and be used alongside Sapphire Rapids in high-performance computers. In an interview, Mr. Gelsinger said Sapphire Rapids had the makings of a hit, despite the delays. He picked Ms. Rivera in 2021 to take over the unit developing it, where she is using lessons from the experience to change how Intel designs and tests its products. He said Intel had conducted several internal reviews of what happened with Sapphire Rapids, and \u201cwe\u2019re not done.\u201d Sapphire Rapids began in 2015, with discussions among a small group of Intel engineers. The product was the company\u2019s first attempt at a new approach in chip design. Companies now routinely pack tens of billions of tiny transistors on each piece of silicon, but competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and others had started making processors from multiple chips bundled together in plastic packages. Intel engineers came up with a design with four chips, each one sporting 15 processor \u201ccores\u201d that act like individual calculators for general-purpose computing jobs. The company also decided to include extra blocks of circuitry for special tasks \u2014 including artificial intelligence and encryption \u2014 and to communicate with other components, such as chips that store data. The interaction among so many elements is \u201cvery complex,\u201d said Shlomit Weiss, who jointly leads Intel\u2019s design engineering group. \u201cComplexity usually brings problems.\u201d The Sapphire Rapids team grappled with bugs, flaws caused by designer errors or manufacturing glitches that can cause a chip to make incorrect calculations, work slowly or stop functioning. They were also affected by delays in the product\u2019s manufacturing process.\n\nBut by December 2019, the engineers had hit a milestone called \u201ctape-in.\u201d That\u2019s when electronic files containing a completed design move to a factory to make sample chips. The sample chips arrived in early 2020, as Covid-19 forced lockdowns. The engineers soon got the computing cores on Sapphire Rapids communicating with one another, said Nevine Nassif, the project\u2019s chief engineer. But more work than expected remained. One key chore was \u201cvalidation,\u201d a testing process in which Intel and its customers run software on sample chips to simulate computing chores and catch bugs. Once flaws are found and fixed, designs may go back to the factory to make new test chips, which typically takes more than a month. Repeating that process led to missed deadlines. Ms. Nassif said Sapphire Rapids was designed to counter AMD\u2019s Milan processor, which was introduced in March 2021. But it still wasn\u2019t ready by that June, when Intel announced a delay until the next year to allow more validation.\n\nIn October 2021, Ms. Rivera and a top design executive established weekly Sapphire Rapids status meetings, held each Monday at 7 a.m. Those gatherings showed steady progress in finding and fixing bugs, she said, bolstering confidence about starting production in the second quarter of 2022. Then came the discovery of the flaw last May. Ms. Rivera would not describe it in detail but said it had affected the processor\u2019s performance. In June, she used an investor event to announce a delay of at least a quarter, which pushed Sapphire Rapids later than the launch of a competing AMD chip in November. \u201cWe were ready to ship,\u201d Ms. Nassif said. The final delay \u201cwas just so sad given all the effort that had gone into it.\u201d Ms. Rivera saw a series of lessons from the setbacks. One was simply that Intel packed too many innovations into Sapphire Rapids, rather than deliver a less ambitious product sooner. She also concluded that the team should have spent more time on perfecting and testing its design using computer simulations. Finding bugs before they are in sample chips is less expensive, and would have made it possible to remove features to simplify the product, Ms. Rivera said. She has since moved to bolster Intel\u2019s simulation and validation abilities. \u201cWe used to have a lot of this kind of muscle that we let atrophy,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cNow we\u2019re rebuilding.\u201d She also determined that Intel had scheduled more products than its engineers and customers could easily handle. So she streamlined that product road map, including pushing back a successor to Sapphire Rapids to 2024 from 2023.\n\nMore broadly, Ms. Rivera and other Intel executives have pushed the organization to develop better processes for documenting technical issues, and sharing that information inside and outside the company. Some Intel customers say the communication has gotten better. \u201cHas everything gone well? No,\u201d said Lenovo\u2019s Mr. Skaugen, who once ran Intel\u2019s server chip business. \u201cBut we were surprised a lot less than we were in the past.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWhen a Virgin Orbit rocket fell short of orbit, it dealt a blow to Britain\u2019s space program and the companies whose satellites were lost in the mission.\n\nThe failed attempt to launch satellites into space from Britain for the first time has dealt a harsh blow to the country\u2019s emerging space program. Britain\u2019s space-business community was full of optimism on Monday, with a ticket-paying crowd looking on as a modified Boeing 747 carrying a rocket stuffed with nine satellites took off from an airport in Cornwall in southwest England. It was just before midnight when things soured. The rocket successfully separated from the plane and fired its first-stage engine. But, at a speed of more than 11,000 miles an hour, the rocket \u201cexperienced an anomaly, ending the mission prematurely,\u201d according to Virgin Orbit, the California-based company behind the launch. A spokeswoman for Virgin Orbit said Tuesday afternoon that the company had not yet completed its analysis of the flight data but it appeared that the rocket never reached orbit, and that the second stage, which carried the satellites, had mostly burned up on re-entry off the west coast of Africa.\n\nMatt Archer, the director of commercial spaceflight at the UK Space Agency, said that British regulators were reviewing the incident with Virgin Orbit, trying to discover \u201cwhat happened, what caused the issue and how they can correct it going forward.\u201d While the 747 and its crew returned safely, the nine satellites aboard the rocket were lost. The destruction of these high-tech devices means that their makers and sponsors have potentially lost years of work. \u201cWe are mindful that we failed to provide our customers with the launch service they deserve,\u201d Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday. Failures in space launches are not unusual, and, at first glance, this one seems unlikely to deter Britain\u2019s effort to become a country that not only can make satellites but also launch them.\n\nAnother company taking a hit was In-Space Missions, a British satellite maker. A team at the company had spent the last couple of years making a pair of small surveillance devices for the launch, funded by an agency of the British Ministry of Defense. \u201cOur two satellites would have been two of the most complex and magnificent satellites in the night sky,\u201d said Doug Liddle, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTo have lost those is very upsetting for everyone.\u201d Most of the devices on board were probably not insured, he said. Still, British officials and people in the space industry say that even though the launch went awry, it represents important advances. To stage the launch, Britain has had to develop both the necessary infrastructure and regulatory regimes, a lengthy process. \u201cWe didn\u2019t quite make it over the line, but we have made it most of the way there,\u201d Mr. Liddle said. In recent years, the British government has grown more interested in space, particularly under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who left office last year. Britain has long had a satellite manufacturing industry, including companies that make miniature devices known as cubesats that are increasingly being used for communications networks and other purposes. The country\u2019s space industry has pushed for a launch capability to give it an edge that would allow it to test devices more easily. The idea has won support among some circles in government.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has provided added incentive to the goal of launching from one\u2019s own country, partly because Britain and other countries can no longer rely on paying for rides aboard Russian launch vehicles, as they once did. In addition, the heavy use of satellites in the Ukraine conflict for reconnaissance and communications has underscored the growing importance of space for national security. Many of the devices on board the Virgin Orbit rocket fit this description, including those developed by In-Space Missions. The RHEA Group satellite was to be tested as part of a backup network in case Global Positioning System navigation system was knocked out by a cyberattack or technical problem. Also on board was a cubesat made by AAC Clyde Space, a Scottish company, designed to track illegal fishing, smuggling and other maritime activities. Another satellite was a communications device for Oman, a Persian Gulf emirate. British government funding and private money, totaling about 20 million pounds, or $24 million, helped develop Newquay Airport in Cornwall to make it ready to handle satellites, according to Melissa Thorpe, the head of Spaceport Cornwall, where Monday night\u2019s flight originated. While it is difficult to say what effect Monday\u2019s launch failure might have on future government support in Britain, the country\u2019s space industry has momentum. Preparations for vertical rocket launches are already well underway at two sites in Scotland. \u201cThe commitment remains as solid as it was yesterday,\u201d said Mr. Archer of the UK Space Agency. \u201cWe always knew that these projects carried risk,\u201d he added. Virgin Orbit, founded by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson, also seems inclined to return, although Mr. Hart, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview just before the failure that the launch in Britain had been an \u201cexpensive undertaking\u201d because of the need to work out logistics and regulatory matters.",

But as bookstores placed \u201cSpare\u201d in window displays and flung open their doors on Tuesday, reaction appeared muted in London under a rainy gray sky. Early-morning lines teemed with journalists, but regular book buyers were slower to file through the doors. That seemed at odds with the interest that some booksellers said the memoir had drummed up and with the anticipation it had garnered online. Waterstones, Britain\u2019s largest bookstore chain, said that it had seen some of the biggest preorders in a decade, and that \u201cunprecedented\u201d numbers of people had ordered the memoir for in-store pickup on Tuesday. The memoir also raced to the top of the list of best sellers on Amazon\u2019s websites in Britain and the United States. \u201cWe expect \u2018Spare\u2019 to be one of this year\u2019s best sellers,\u201d John Cotterill, the nonfiction category manager for Waterstones, said in a statement on Tuesday, saying that the book \u201cadded welcome interest to a usually quieter month.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for another retailer, WH Smith, declined to comment on sales but said that the company had extended hours at a small number of stores so that they would be open at midnight for the memoir\u2019s release. Of those who did venture into bookstores, some were curious and others were dismissive of the latest episode in a mounting royal drama that has played out in tell-all interviews, in a Netflix documentary series and on social media. Some said they saw recent revelations by Prince Harry as nothing more than a distraction \u2014 the machinations of Britain\u2019s aristocracy at stark odds with the deepening economic squeeze being felt across the country. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

I don\u2019t think people care,\u201d said Nikki Kastner, an owner of Herne Hill Books, a small independent seller in South London. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 launch, is it?\u201d Others, however, appeared to be more intrigued. Monika Nicolaou, a self-described fan of Britain\u2019s royal family, dropped by the Waterstones bookstore in London\u2019s Piccadilly Circus to pick up a copy of \u201cSpare\u201d on Tuesday and planned to start reading it on her way to work.\n\nIn the book, Harry writes about the death of his mother, Princess Diana; about his account of the negotiations over his role in the family that led Harry and his wife, Meghan, to eventually leave England; about his tense relationship with his brother, Prince William; about his own battles with anxiety and about his time in Afghanistan, among other insights. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt\u2019s making people question whether they really like him or not,\u201d said James Broadley, who was looking at the bookstore\u2019s display with his wife. The book is retailing for 28 pounds, or about $35, but many retailers like Waterstones and Amazon are selling it for half price \u2014 a customary offer for a \u201chighly anticipated and prominent publication\u201d to compete with heavy online discounting, according to a spokeswoman for Waterstones. Although Mr. Broadley said he did not see himself as a huge royalist, he said he was considering buying the book and nonetheless found the situation intriguing.\n\n\u201cThis is part of him going alone,\u201d Mr. Broadley said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make it somehow.\u201d Prince Harry has said that he will give a portion of proceeds from the book to British charities, according to a description on the memoir\u2019s website. The biggest revelation for Elisabeth Stang, 56, a tourist from Norway who picked up a copy of the book at Waterstones, was the extent of the rift between Prince Harry and his older brother, Prince William, now heir to the throne. \u201cThey are a hurt family,\u201d she said, adding that the two had lost their mother so young and with the whole world watching them. \u201cI just think they are more normal than maybe we all think they are,\u201d she said. Joanna Davey, 38, who was passing through Waterstones for a meeting but did not buy the book, said: \u201cI just feel really sad for him. I think you can tell he\u2019s really experienced a lot of trauma in his life.\u201d \u201cIt would be better if he sat down with a therapist instead of spilling his guts on paper,\u201d she added. In the book, Harry does write about going to therapy, saying his wife persuaded him to continue it. Aside from rainy skies, some blamed the wall-to-wall news media coverage of the memoir\u2019s leaked contents in previous days for any less-than-enthusiastic in-person reaction on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been on the radio all week. People are sick of it,\u201d said Salman Gohar, a London cabdriver. \u201cIt took the magic out of the launch.\u201d \u201cI liked him before, but he\u2019s just going after them one by one now,\u201d Mr. Gohar added in reference to Prince Harry.\n\nThe book\u2019s revelations have reignited older gossip about the family among royal watchers \u2014 Prince Harry writing, for example, about how he and his brother begged his father not to marry Camilla, now the queen consort. For those unwilling to brave the weather on Tuesday, there was social media. Reactions flickered between the comical, the supportive and the morally outraged. The hashtags #SparebyPrinceHarry and #Camilla trended on Tuesday on Twitter, with many lamenting that Prince Harry was aggravating mounting rifts in the royal family, while others expressed sympathy for his account of what he and his wife had endured. Even bookstores themselves could not resist getting in on the action, with one independent retailer in Britain opting for a characteristically more satirical window display. \u201cAnyway, we do have some spare copies of Spare if you want one,\u201d it concluded.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAs the U.S. liaison to some 50,000 United Nations diplomats and staff, he sought to resolve disputes on issues ranging from fugitives hiding in U.N. missions to diplomats\u2019 unpaid parking tickets.\n\nRobert C. Moller, a former New York City police detective who as a State Department diplomat spent two decades shielding visiting U.N. delegates from the idiosyncrasies of New York City and vice versa, died on Dec. 6 at his home in Freehold Township, N.J. He was 85. The cause was a degenerative brain condition called progressive supranuclear palsy, his son Thomas Moller said. As if Mr. Moller\u2019s job in the police Intelligence Division wasn\u2019t perilous enough, his subsequent portfolio as the host country\u2019s liaison for some 50,000 United Nations envoys and staff would have tested the patience of any referee or pacificator. Mr. Moller (pronounced MOE-ler) gently pressured deadbeat countries to reduce what they owed in rent, parking fines and overdue utility bills (including $86,000 that Uganda and Cameroon owed Consolidated Edison). He helped expand the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to garnish the wages of United Nations workers who miss alimony and child support.\n\nHe dealt with challenges to travel restrictions that the United States placed on diplomats from certain countries and immunity claimed from local criminal and civil statutes. In 1983, his office intervened with officials in Englewood, N.J., who objected that Libya\u2019s United Nations ambassador had turned a million-dollar one-family home into a retreat for more than a dozen employees of that country\u2019s U.N. Mission. That same year, Mr. Moller\u2019s office negotiated the surrender of a North Korean diplomat who had been hiding in his country\u2019s Manhattan mission for 10 months to avoid arrest for sexual assault. The diplomat left the mission, pleaded guilty to sexual abuse and vowed to leave the United States and never return. His surrender affirmed the legal doctrine that diplomats from observer missions are entitled to immunity from arrest only for acts connected with their official duties. Mr. Moller\u2019s job \u2014 minister-counselor for host country affairs of the United States Mission to the United Nations \u2014 sometimes required creative diplomacy. He once sought to force the recall of a Mexican ambassador who had drawn his gun on a New York City driver over a parking dispute, The Washington Post reported. When a low-flying helicopter nearly hit the weekend residence of the Soviet delegate to the United Nations, Mr. Moller was the one trying to explain it to Soviet officials.\n\nHis office often attracted more mundane concerns, including requests for help from poorer countries challenged by the city\u2019s high cost of living; complaints about water main breaks and power failures; and episodic crackdowns by politically-sensitive public officials on double-parked diplomats and other abuses by drivers with diplomatic license plates. In 1984, the State Department assumed responsibility from state motor vehicle departments for issuing diplomatic plates; it required that unpaid parking tickets be settled before plates could be renewed. The perception that foreign diplomats get away with murder is misplaced, Mr. Moller told The Washington Post in 2003. \u201cOur statistics show that the diplomats are probably victims of crime 30 times compared to the one time they commit the crime,\u201d he said. Robert Charles Moller was born on March 30, 1937, in Brooklyn. His father, Viggo, was a police officer. His mother, Helen (Bodenstedt) Moller, was a homemaker. He graduated from James Madison High School and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Albright College in Reading, Pa., in 1958. He served in the Army Reserves and received a master\u2019s degree in public administration from Baruch College of the City University of New York in 1971. In addition to his son Thomas, he is survived by his wife, Margaret (Carrigy) Moller; their other sons, Robert and Kenneth Moller; their daughter Christine Mitchinson; his sisters, Marilyn Slaker and Joan Taks; 11 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Moller\u2019s first job after college was with the New York City Police Department. He retired as a first grade detective in the intelligence division in 1976.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Rufo often talks about the \u201clong march through the institutions,\u201d a phrase coined by the German socialist Rudi Dutschke in 1967 but frequently attributed to the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci. Thwarted in their hope of imminent revolution, the new left of Dutschke\u2019s generation sought instead to bore into political and cultural institutions, working within the system to change the basic assumptions of Western society. Rufo\u2019s trying, he said, to \u201csteal the strategies and the principles of the Gramscian left, and then to organize a kind of counterrevolutionary response to the long march through the institutions.\u201d\n\nThis grandiose project has several parts. Rufo has been unparalleled in fanning public education culture wars, whipping up anger first against critical race theory and then against teaching on L.G.B.T.Q. issues. This year, he is turning his attention to diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and, with his colleagues at the Manhattan Institute, will soon unveil model legislation to abolish such programs at state schools. In New College, he sees a chance to create a new type of educational institution to replace those he\u2019s trying to destroy. When we spoke, he compared his plans to Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter.\n\nLater this month, Rufo said, he\u2019ll travel to New College with a \u201clanding team\u201d of board members, lawyers, consultants and political allies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be conducting a top-down restructuring,\u201d he said, with plans to \u201cdesign a new core curriculum from scratch\u201d and \u201cencode it in a new academic master plan.\u201d Given that Hillsdale, the template for this reimagined New College, worked closely with the Trump administration to create a \u201cpatriotic education\u201d curriculum, this master plan will likely be heavy on American triumphalism. Rufo hopes to move fast, saying that the school\u2019s academic departments \u201care going to look very different in the next 120 days.\u201d\n\nThe values of the people who are already at New College are of little concern to Rufo, who, like several other new trustees, doesn\u2019t live in Florida. Speaking of current New College students who chose it precisely for its progressive culture, Rufo said: \u201cWe\u2019re happy to work with them to make New College a great place to continue their education. Or we\u2019d be happy to work with them to help them find something that suits them better.\u201d\n\nOf course, as both leftist revolutionaries and colonialists have learned over the years, replacing one culture with another can be harder than anticipated. New College students may not go quietly. Steve Shipman, a professor of physical chemistry and president of the faculty union, points out that tenured professors are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which makes it hard to fire them unless there\u2019s cause. People like Rufo \u201care making statements to make impact,\u201d Shipman said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t know how viable some of those statements are on the ground.\u201d",

A series of high-profile interviews, along with leaked excerpts and premature sales of the book in Spain, heightened interest in a memoir that offers a frank, if one-sided, look at Harry\u2019s life. Harry says he decided to write \u201cSpare\u201d when he traveled to Britain for his grandfather\u2019s funeral in April 2021. There he had the \u201cstaggering\u201d realization that neither his father nor his brother truly understood why he and his wife, Meghan, had moved to California. \u201cI have to tell them,\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd so: Pa?

What I do remember with startling clarity is that I didn\u2019t cry. Not one tear. Pa didn\u2019t hug me. He wasn\u2019t great at showing emotions under normal circumstances, how could he be expected to show them in such a crisis? But his hand did fall once more on my knee and he said: It\u2019s going to be OK. That was quite a lot for him. Fatherly, hopeful, kind. And so very untrue.\u201d The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

Here\u2019s a look at Dysfunction and disorder are hardly restricted to the House of Windsor. Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies Years after his mother\u2019s death, Harry asked to see the secret police files related to the crash. Harry\u2019s private secretary obtained the files, though he removed the most \u201cchallenging\u201d ones, Harry wrote. Still, he saw many paparazzi photos of his dying mother. The men who followed her \u201cnever stopped shooting her while she lay between the seats, unconscious, or semiconscious,\u201d he writes. \u201cNot one of them was checking on her, offering her help, not even comforting her. They were just shooting, shooting, shooting.\u201d\n\nPrince William and Harry begged Charles not to marry Camilla \u201cWhen asked, Willy and I promised Pa that we\u2019d welcome Camilla into the family,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cThe only thing we asked in return was that he not marry her. You don\u2019t need to remarry, we pleaded. \u2026 We support you, we said. We endorse Camilla, we said. Just please don\u2019t marry her.\u201d Press leaks from his family were common, he says According to the book, Charles and sometimes Camilla approved damaging press leaks about Harry and William. On one occasion, Harry writes, Charles \u2014 advised by a spin doctor \u2014 cooperated with the tabloids on a story about Harry and drugs to bolster his own faltering reputation. \u201cNo more the unfaithful husband, Pa would now be presented to the world as the harried single dad coping with a drug-addled child.\u201d Much later, in 2019, Harry writes, William was \u201cseething\u201d because \u201cPa and Camilla\u2019s people had planted a story or stories about him, and Kate, and the kids, and he wasn\u2019t going to take it any more. Give Pa and Camilla an inch, he said, they take a mile.\u201d Separately, the news report that Harry and Meghan were leaving England included a tidbit that Harry believes was leaked by the palace. The article, which appeared in The Sun, \u201cincluded the telling detail that we\u2019d offered to relinquish our Sussex titles,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cThere was only one document on earth in which that detail was mentioned \u2014 my private and confidential letter to my father. To which a shockingly, damningly small number of people had access. We hadn\u2019t even mentioned it to our closest friends.\u201d While in Afghanistan, he killed 25 Taliban fighters \u201cMost soldiers can\u2019t tell you precisely how much death is on their ledger,\u201d Harry writes of his tours during the war. \u201cMy number: 25.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile in the heat of combat, I didn\u2019t think of those 25 as people. You can\u2019t kill people if you think of them as people. They were chess pieces removed from the board, Bads taken away before they could kill Goods. I\u2019d been trained to \u2018other-ize\u2019 them, trained well. On some level I recognized this learned detachment as problematic. But I also saw it as an unavoidable part of soldiering.\u201d\n\nFear of public speaking morphed into a fear of crowds, and then full-blown anxiety attacks on the cusp of his 30th birthday. In the book, Harry sees the afflictions as a form of PTSD, attributing them to both his military service and the death of his mother. When he told his father what was happening, Charles said: \u201cI suppose it\u2019s my fault. I should\u2019ve got you the help you needed years ago.\u201d Harry writes: \u201cI assured him that it wasn\u2019t his fault. But I appreciated the apology.\u201d A trip to the North Pole left Harry with some discomfort. \u201cUpon arriving home I\u2019d been horrified to discover that my nether regions were frostnipped as well, and while the ears and cheeks were already healing, the todger wasn\u2019t,\u201d he reports. When home remedies \u2014 like applying Elizabeth Arden cream \u2014 did not work, he finally saw a doctor. Meghan convinced him to return to therapy One evening during their courtship, \u201cMeg said something I took the wrong way,\u201d so \u201cI snapped at her, spoke to her harshly \u2014 cruelly.\u201d Meghan left the room. \u201cI went and found her upstairs. She was sitting in the bedroom. She was calm, but said in a quiet, level tone that she would never stand for being spoken to like that.\u201d Harry writes: She wanted to know where it came from.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\nWhere did you ever hear a man speak like that to a woman? Did you overhear adults speak that way when you were growing up?\n\n\n\nI cleared my throat, looked away. Yes. Harry told Meghan he\u2019d tried therapy, but it hadn\u2019t helped. \u201cNo,\u201d she told him. \u201cTry again.\u201d Charles told Harry there wasn\u2019t money to support him and Meghan The exchange between father and son when Harry announced his intention to marry did not go as expected. Does she want to carry on working?\n\n\n\nSay again?\n\n\n\nDoes she want to keep on acting?\n\n\n\nOh, I mean, I don\u2019t know, I wouldn\u2019t think so. I expect she\u2019ll want to be with me, doing the job, you know, which would rule out \u201cSuits\u201d \u2026 since they film in \u2026 Toronto.\n\n\n\nHmm, I see. Well, darling boy, you know there\u2019s not enough money to go around.\n\n\n\nI stared. What was he banging on about?\n\n\n\nHe explained. Or tried to. I can\u2019t pay for anyone else. I\u2019m already having to pay for your brother and Catherine. Harry writes: \u201cPa didn\u2019t financially support Willy and me, and our families, out of any largesse. That was his job. That was the whole deal. We agreed to serve the monarch, go wherever we were sent, do whatever we were told, surrender our autonomy, keep our hands and feet in the gilded cage at all times, and in exchange the keepers of the cage agreed to feed and clothe us.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t about money, of course: \u201cPa might have dreaded the rising cost of maintaining us, but what he really couldn\u2019t stomach was someone new dominating the monarchy, grabbing the limelight, someone shiny and new coming in and overshadowing him.\u201d William didn\u2019t want Harry to be the best man at his wedding \u201cThe public had been told that I was to be best man, but that was a bare-faced lie,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cWilly didn\u2019t want me giving a best-man speech. He didn\u2019t think it was safe to hand me a live mic and put me in a position to go off-script. He wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d Still, he managed to present the newly married couple with an ermine thong at the wedding reception: \u201cThe room let out a collective gasp,\u201d he writes, then \u201ca warm, gratifying wave of laughter.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a single human being in the 300,000-year history of the species who\u2019d done more damage to our collective sense of reality,\u201d he writes. But those hired to shoot photographs for British tabloids are targets of his anger, too. \u201cThe paps had always been grotesque people, but as I reached maturity they were worse,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were more emboldened, more radicalized, just as young men in Iraq had been radicalized. Their mullahs were editors, the same ones who\u2019d vowed to do better after Mummy died.\u201d\n\nHarry and Meghan felt blindsided during negotiations over their future The couple chose to leave England, but hoped to keep up some of their royal duties and to retain the security that came with their titles. Instead, after a meeting dubbed \u201cthe Sandringham Summit\u201d in January 2020, they learned that, in Harry\u2019s words, \u201cthe fix was in\u201d \u2014 they would no longer represent the queen and their security would continue for only a 12-month transition period. (In fact, they would lose that security several months later.) \u201cI love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will,\u201d Harry writes. \u201cI just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they\u2019d both been there for me.\u201d",

Like many people, she browsed real estate listings for entertainment, perusing beautiful places and dreaming a little. \u201cI just loved seeing what was on the market,\u201d said Ms. Koch, 59, the principal of Koch Architects, in Berkeley, Calif. \u201cI was always looking at rural properties on Redfin, surfing without even knowing why.\u201d Then one day in 2017, an online wave carried her to a listing she couldn\u2019t ignore: a 1,200-square-foot modernist house built in 1974 in the Sea Ranch, a community in Sonoma County, about 110 miles north of Berkeley. Perched on a sloped lot of just under half an acre, between redwood, bishop pine and grand fir trees, it had been designed by William Turnbull Jr., a prolific architect who died in 1997 and whose work Ms. Koch had long admired. Joanne Koch, right, an architect based in Berkeley, Calif., and her partner, Bryan Connell, bought and renovated a 1974 house in the Sea Ranch, designed by the prolific architect William L. Turnbull Jr. Preston Gannaway for The New York Times \u201cMy heart jumped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a physical reaction.\u201d She had \u201calways felt a kinship\u201d to Mr. Turnbull\u2019s work, she said, particularly the way he took the simple forms of vernacular agricultural buildings and translated them into modern homes.\n\nBut the house was already in contract. Ms. Koch studied the photos and moved on, with a vague sense that she had missed a rare opportunity to buy a home that would have been ideal for herself and her partner, Bryan Connell, 73, an artist. Months later, back on Redfin, Ms. Koch was surprised again: The deal had fallen through and the house was back on the market. Although she had no real estate agent or financing in place, she called the listing agent and made plans to see it. \u201cIt was better than I imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the moment I walked in, underneath the suspended catwalk and into the two-story atrium, and the view down the ravine to the ocean. It had all these wonderful qualities of good architecture. I scrambled to put things in place to buy it, because I knew if another architect saw it, it would be gone.\u201d\n\nShe succeeded and closed on the house for $570,000 in February 2018, well aware that it had many problems. The septic system needed to be replaced. The structure was in need of waterproofing around the foundation, including a new French drain to eliminate standing water in the crawl space. A planned exterior deck had never been completed, so four sets of sliding-glass doors opened to a treacherous drop. The heating system, powered by a diesel furnace that rumbled like a tractor, also had to go. As Ms. Koch studied the house more closely, she admired Mr. Turnbull\u2019s design decisions, but also saw room for improvement. The two bedrooms, for instance, were separated by a diagonal wall. \u201cIn the \u201970s, the diagonal was very popular,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the bedrooms were sliced in this awkward way, such that there was no possible way to furnish them.\u201d The two sleeping lofts were also dark, with tiny windows that offered no views. \u201cI think this was because it was built with a very lean budget initially,\u201d Ms. Koch said.\n\nShe planned to straighten out the bedroom wall and add a few new windows that mimicked the proportions of the ones Mr. Turnbull had originally installed. \u201cI found opportunities that I thought had been missed in the initial design,\u201d she said. Intent on preserving the character of the home, she had her contractors gingerly deconstruct the diagonal wall and reuse the boards in one of the new bedrooms. There wasn\u2019t enough material for the second bedroom, and Ms. Koch was unsure about what type of wood it was, so she took a piece to Healdsburg Lumber Company, a local building supply store. \u201cI found this guy who was like the lumber whisperer,\u201d she said. \u201cHe smelled it and said, \u2018This is sugar pine.\u2019 We ordered exactly the same material.\u201d",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida at a campaign event in Coconut Creek, Fla., in November.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe Florida governor easily won re-election despite little engagement with mainstream news outlets, another sign of partisan division ahead of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAssigned to cover the re-election campaign of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Miles Cohen, a young ABC News reporter, found himself stymied. The governor would not grant him an interview. Aides barred him from some campaign events and interrupted his conversations with supporters. When Mr. Cohen was finally able to ask a question about the governor\u2019s handling of Hurricane Ian, Mr. DeSantis shouted him down \u2014 \u201cStop, stop, stop\u201d \u2014 and scolded the media for \u201ctrying to cast aspersions.\u201d The DeSantis campaign then taunted Mr. Cohen on Twitter, prompting a torrent of online vitriol. So on election night, Mr. Cohen decamped to a friendlier environment for the news media: Mar-a-Lago, where former President Donald J. Trump greeted reporters by name. \u201cHe came up to us, asked how the sandwiches were and took 20 questions,\u201d Mr. Cohen recalled. Mr. Trump, who heckled the \u201cfake news\u201d in his speech that evening, elevated media-bashing into a high art for Republicans. But ahead of the next presidential race, potential candidates like Mr. DeSantis are taking a more radical approach: not just attacking nonpartisan news outlets, but ignoring them altogether.\n\nHis success is an ominous sign for the usual rules of engagement between politicians and the press as another nationwide election looms. Presidential candidates typically endure media scrutiny in exchange for the megaphone and influence of mainstream outlets. But in an intensely partisan, choose-your-own-news era, the traditional calculus may have shifted. \u201cThe old way of looking at it is: \u2018I have to do every media hit that I possibly can, from as broad a political spectrum as I can, to reach as many people as possible,\u2019\u201d said Nick Iarossi, a longtime DeSantis supporter and a lobbyist in Tallahassee. \u201cThe new way of looking at it is: \u2018I really don\u2019t need to do that anymore. I can control how I want to message to voters through the mediums I choose.\u2019\u201d In 2022, Mr. DeSantis was not alone. Doug Mastriano, the Republican who ran for governor in Pennsylvania, engaged almost entirely with conservative media outlets. (Unlike Mr. DeSantis, Mr. Mastriano lost badly.) In Maryland and Wisconsin, reporters covering the Republican candidates for governor were often given no notice for some events, resorting to Eventbrite pages and social media to find a candidate\u2019s whereabouts. On a national level, the Republican Party announced last year that it was boycotting the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has organized general election debates since 1988.\n\nMr. DeSantis, a Yale and Harvard graduate who often assails what he calls the \u201cAcela media,\u201d has spent years working to upend those assumptions. Florida reporters have complained about a lack of access to Mr. DeSantis since he was elected governor in 2018, a victory fueled in part by dozens of appearances on Fox News. His anti-media hostility intensified during the pandemic, when he faced criticism for reopening Florida early; in March 2020, a staff writer for The Miami Herald was barred from a news conference about the virus. In 2021, he held a lengthy news conference in April denying a claim by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he improperly rewarded a campaign donor; the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment received some pushback from press critics. The next month, the governor blocked every outlet except Fox News from attending a signing ceremony for a state law, prompting one local TV reporter to complain that Floridians \u201chad their eyes and ears in that room cut off.\u201d By the summer, many news outlets were prohibited from attending a gathering of Florida Republicans, while conservative writers and podcasters were granted access. \u201cWe in the state of Florida are not going to allow legacy media outlets to be involved in our primaries,\u201d Mr. DeSantis told a cheering crowd. His communications director, Lindsey Curnutte, later mocked reporters in a Twitter post aimed at \u201cfake news journalists,\u201d asking, \u201cHow\u2019s the view from outside security?\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Ms. Pushaw\u2019s Twitter account was suspended after she criticized a report by The Associated Press and urged her followers to \u201cdrag them.\u201d Ms. Pushaw, then serving as the governor\u2019s press secretary, wrote that she would put the A.P. reporter \u201con blast\u201d if he did not modify the story; the reporter later received online threats. The A.P. complained about \u201ca direct effort to activate an online mob to attack a journalist for doing his job.\u201d Ms. Pushaw responded that \u201cdrag them\u201d was a slang term and did not amount to inciting a violent threat. The incident prompted an outcry. \u201cAs someone who believes in the role of press in an open society, I found it unbelievable, not only what she was allowed to do, but encouraged to do,\u201d said Barbara Petersen, a longtime First Amendment advocate who runs the Florida Center for Government Accountability. \u201cI find it very disturbing, frankly, that this man, who is our governor, won\u2019t talk to the people whose job it is to keep us informed.\u201d In December, the news outlet Semafor reported on Mr. DeSantis\u2019s preference for local right-wing news outlets. The governor\u2019s team pushed back, comparing reporters to \u201cDemocrat activists,\u201d and high-profile conservatives offered encouragement.\n\n\u201cIn an environment where corporate media are just straight up anti-G.O.P. propagandists \u2014 and extremely proud of it \u2014 why is Ron DeSantis the only person taking it seriously?\u201d wrote Mollie Hemingway, editor of The Federalist. Whether Mr. DeSantis can keep up his approach to media remains unclear. Mr. Trump may have mastered Twitter, but it was his ubiquity on big outlets like CNN and MSNBC that solidified his electoral appeal. Even an anti-media message, it turns out, may need the media\u2019s help. \u201cGoing back to 2016, Trump was at his most effective when he was anti-media but would nevertheless talk to anybody,\u201d said Mr. Conant, the former Rubio aide. \u201cHe was getting his message out on CNN and MSNBC every day, even though part of his message was that the media is terrible.\u201d",

The situation stands in contrast to Ukraine\u2019s strategy elsewhere along the front line, where it has avoided direct confrontations, relying instead on nimble maneuvers, deception and Western-provided long-range weapons. Fierce fighting continued to rage yesterday along the front line that extends from Bakhmut northeast toward the city of Soledar, with the Russians claiming to have taken a nearby village and Ukraine saying that it had repelled Russian attempts to storm Soledar itself. Bakhmut\u2019s strategic value is debatable, but it carries symbolic importance for both sides. In an earlier phase of the war, Ukraine\u2019s leadership had been more equivocal about pitched battles like that in Bakhmut, after about 100 Ukrainian soldiers per day died in the fight for the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. But new research has vindicated the attritional fighting, which analysts said had weakened the Russian Army enough for two Ukrainian counterattacks in the fall to succeed. Mercenaries: The Wagner Group\u2019s Kremlin-aligned founder said that Soledar was \u201cbeing taken solely by Wagner units,\u201d which Western security officials and analysts say operate largely outside the Russian military\u2019s chain of command.\n\nAt least 1,200 protesters were detained after the storming of government buildings in Brazil\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia, the police said yesterday. The authorities began dismantling the tent city where supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president, had been camping out since he lost October\u2019s election. As of yesterday, the dispersal of the protesters had been peaceful. Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters broke into the government buildings on Sunday to protest what they falsely claim was a stolen election. In the weeks after the vote, Brazil\u2019s military and independent experts said they had found no credible evidence of fraud. Official counts on the number of people arrested ranged from at least 200 to more than 400. The protesters will be questioned by law enforcement officials, and some could be charged with committing crimes against democratic institutions or attempting to unseat a democratically elected government.\n\nRestoration of the ozone layer is back on track Recovery of the ozone layer could happen within a few decades, scientists said in a U.N.-backed report, as China has nearly eliminated rogue chemical emissions. Ozone levels between the polar regions are expected to reach pre-1980 levels by 2040, if current policies continue, and ozone holes should also recover. In 2018, scientists revealed that global emissions of CFC-11, a chemical that was most likely used in China to make foam insulation, had increased since 2012. Investigations by The Times and others strongly suggested that small factories in eastern China that were disregarding the global ban were the source. Those new emissions had threatened to undermine the Montreal Protocol, the treaty negotiated in the 1980s to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons in favor of more benign chemicals after it was discovered that chlorofluorocarbons were depleting atmospheric ozone.\n\nControversy exploded in August, when the association\u2019s president, James H. Sweet, a leading historian of the African diaspora, published a column titled \u201cIs History History?\u201d in which he lamented a troubling politicization of scholarship. The column provoked a firestorm, which spread along racial and generational fault lines. Ansu Fati, Barcelona\u2019s brilliant record-breaker: When Lionel Messi\u2019s heir apparent suffered an injury, it changed everything. Why has Romeo Beckham joined Brentford? Cynics will suspect a marketing stunt, but Beckham will have a chance to prove he has a future in soccer. What does Beth England\u2019s transfer mean for her and Tottenham? The player needed more game time, so her move to Spurs makes perfect sense, but will she get the service to flourish? A seismic shift in the world of fine dining: Noma will close for regular service at the end of 2024. The Copenhagen restaurant, which has topped lists of the world\u2019s best restaurants, will become a full-time food laboratory focused on its e-commerce operation. It will open to diners only for periodic pop-ups. Noma\u2019s influence will live on through its imitators, the Times restaurant critic Pete Wells writes. Its innovations included its methods of foraging and pickling, its rustic pieces of hand-thrown pottery, its innovative plating and its odd-smelling natural wines. Its creator, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, has been hailed as his era\u2019s most brilliant and influential chef. But Redzepi said that the current model, which changed fine dining, was \u201cunsustainable.\u201d Staff members at Noma work grueling hours. The workplace culture is intense, and the restaurant long relied on an army of unpaid interns. One alumnus compared the industry to ballet, another elite pursuit that has abuse built into its very model.\n\nThat\u2019s it for today\u2019s briefing. See you tomorrow. \u2014 Natasha P.S. Mara Hvistendahl is joining The Times from The Intercept as a new investigative correspondent focused on China and Asia. \u201cThe Daily\u201d is on Kevin McCarthy, the new House speaker.

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWe look at five important changes that took effect on Jan. 1.\n\nThese New California Laws Are Taking Effect in 2023\n\nA new year doesn\u2019t always usher in sweeping change, but in California, at least, it usually means a slate of new laws going into effect. As of this month, jaywalking is no longer a crime in the Golden State. Rap lyrics and other artistic work can\u2019t be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. Lunar New Year is now a state holiday. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed hundreds of bills into law last year, and a large share of them are being implemented in 2023. Today I\u2019ll walk you through five important changes that took effect on Jan. 1: Companies with 15 or more employees are now required to list salary ranges for all job postings under a new law aimed at reducing systemic pay inequities. The rule brings California in line with Washington, Colorado and Connecticut, which have passed similar wage transparency laws, The Los Angeles Times reports. In 2019, California became the first state to ban fur when Newsom signed a law prohibiting the sale of new clothing and accessories made of fur. That law, which followed similar provisions in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Berkeley, finally took effect this month.\n\nNew oil wells are barred from neighborhoods. Long championed by environmentalists, this law prohibits new oil wells from being located within 3,200 feet of homes, schools, health care facilities or any building open to the public. Newsom signed the legislation in September, part of a wave of climate bills approved by the California Legislature. But one caveat: Oil and gas companies said last month that they had collected enough signatures to force a referendum on the issue. If the referendum petition qualifies, the new law would immediately be suspended until voters have their say on it next year. The state will pay for prisoners\u2019 phone calls. People who are incarcerated in California can now make free phone calls, under a new law that places the cost of the calls on the state\u2019s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Advocates of the change say that high phone fees unfairly limit communication between prisoners and their loved ones, and that families of inmates in California were paying $68.2 million a year in phone costs. San Diego County has already eliminated charges for jail phone calls, and Los Angeles County is preparing to do so, The San Francisco Chronicle reports. New York City made calls from its jails free in 2018, and the California law will be the second statewide measure, following a Connecticut statute that took effect last year. An increase in the state\u2019s minimum wage this month did not happen because of a new state law, but because of a law already on the books that ties the wage rate to inflation. The minimum wage in California is now $15.50, up from $15 for large employers and $14 for smaller ones last year.\n\nThe rest of the news\n\u2022 None Montecito evacuations: Residents of the community near Santa Barbara were ordered to evacuate because of flooding and mudslides, five years to the day after a 2018 storm sent a deadly torrent of mud and boulders rushing through Montecito.\n\u2022 None Golden Globe Awards: The awards ceremony is back on the air Tuesday. Last year\u2019s ceremony was not televised, at a time when a scandal was growing around the organizers\u2019 finances, ethics and diversity. Here\u2019s how to watch.\n\u2022 None Disney: Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, has ordered employees to return to the office four days a week \u2014 Monday through Thursday \u2014 starting March 1.\n\u2022 None Natural gas prices: Southern California Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric have issued stark warnings to customers that their January natural gas bills could double, The Los Angeles Times reports.\n\u2022 None Assault: A suspect fled the Fresno City College campus after an assault on the first day of the spring semester, The Fresno Bee reports.\n\u2022 None Flooding: Another powerful winter storm unleashed heavy rain in Northern California, causing widespread flooding in Santa Cruz County and beyond, The San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\nAnd before you go, some good news Suzanne Joskow and Henderson Blumer were celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve together in their Los Angeles home in 2020 when just before midnight, he asked her to break open a star-shaped pi\u00f1ata that he had hung onto the stone pine tree in their backyard. \u201cIt was sparkling perfectly, it was very romantic-looking,\u201d she said. Joskow, 39, whacked the pi\u00f1ata, and out flew a black pouch with a ring in it. Blumer, 33, picked it up and got down on one knee. After she said \u201cyes,\u201d fireworks went off around the city. Blumer\u2019s proposal made The Times\u2019s ranking of the 10 best wedding proposals featured in the newspaper in 2022.

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Things are looking up for Kevin McCarthy! Last week it took 15 agonizing roll call votes spread over five days of public humiliation for him to get elected to his dream job as speaker of the House. This week it took him just one drama-free vote on Monday to pass a package of operating rules for the 118th Congress. Better still, no Republicans started shrieking threats at one another on the House floor or had to be manhandled into submission. This qualifies as a solid win for the newly, narrowly elected speaker. Alas, the same cannot be said for anyone interested in a sane, functional Congress.\n\nTo claim the gavel, Mr. McCarthy had to prostrate himself before a rump faction of right-wing extremists. Conveniently for members of this chaos caucus, as one of their Republican colleagues dubbed them, kowtowing is one of his top talents. Some of the rebels\u2019 demands got written into the rules package. Other, touchier ones were hashed out behind closed doors in the sort of back-room deal that anti-establishment Republicans are forever railing against. Even some of Mr. McCarthy\u2019s own troops were miffed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea what promises were made or what gentleman\u2019s handshakes were made,\u201d Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina bemoaned on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nSo much for transparency and accountability.\n\nKnown unknowns notwithstanding, it\u2019s already depressingly clear that the House\u2019s new Republican majority will be at the mercy of its right flank. And while it is tempting \u2014 and fun \u2014 to blame the whole mess on the gelatinous Mr. McCarthy, there are larger forces at play. For years, the G.O.P. has been pursuing an increasingly antimajoritarian approach to political power; it seems only fitting that House Republicans are now facing tyranny of the minority in their own conference.\n\nSome of the concessions made to Mr. McCarthy\u2019s opponents pack more destructive potential than others. Among the official measures is a requirement that any increase in the debt ceiling be matched by reductions in federal spending, possibly including cuts to Social Security and Medicare. This is madness. A debt default could prompt a global financial meltdown. Merely threatening one can lead to America\u2019s credit rating being downgraded, as happened during the Obama administration. Only dangerously irresponsible people play chicken with the debt limit.",

            "section": "World",
            "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara Netanyahu, in October at a campaign event in Migdal Haemek, Israel.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nMany Israelis fear that with Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s return to power at the head of Israel\u2019s most right-wing government, his family members will play an outsize role in his decision making.\n\nWith the Return of Netanyahu in Israel, His Family Is Back, Too\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 When voters in Israel chose to return Benjamin Netanyahu to power they also elevated two people they didn\u2019t elect: his wife Sara and his son Yair, who have long been intertwined with his political career. Ms. Netanyahu and Yair, 31, have helped shape Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s election campaigns and rallied his base. But they have also been accused by critics of wielding undue influence over Mr. Netanyahu by pressuring him over policy issues, weighing in on political appointments and, in his son\u2019s case, even meddling in matters of national security. Their habitual appearances in both the news media, in often sensational and lurid stories, and the Israeli courts have also added to the reality show-like atmosphere around the family. Now, with Mr. Netanyahu, 73, in power again as prime minister of Israel\u2019s most right-wing and religiously conservative government, even as he is standing trial on corruption charges, many Israelis fear that the unelected members of the family will play an outsize role in his political life and decision making.\n\n\u201cThey set the tone. Completely,\u201d Ben Caspit, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a news site, and a biographer of Mr. Netanyahu, said of the presence of Ms. Netanyahu and the couple\u2019s son on the political stage. A retired general testified in court on Jan. 1 that a decade ago, Ms. Netanyahu, 64, an educational psychologist, interviewed him for 45 minutes for a job as her husband\u2019s military secretary after Mr. Netanyahu left the room. Yair Netanyahu caused an uproar last month after publicly leveling treason accusations against the police and state prosecutors who he said had \u201cframed\u201d his father and suggesting that the proscribed punishment for that was execution. \u201cIt\u2019s serious, and it\u2019s not good,\u201d Ariel Saad, 37, an advertising manager in Tel Aviv, said of the presence of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s family so close to the center of power. \u201cNetanyahu is very pliable,\u201d he added, expressing a common perception in Israel. \u201cHow can you run the country under such circumstances?\u201d\n\nFormer and current aides to Mr. Netanyahu say the family is a loving and tight-knit one, and that Ms. Netanyahu and Yair Netanyahu provide critical support for the prime minister. A younger son, Avner, 28, appears less involved in politics but has openly expressed his admiration for his father. (Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage remains in the background.) The staunch domestic support has contributed to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s political longevity and success, experts say. \u201cThose are the people Bibi most trusts; they adore him,\u201d said Mazal Mualem, also an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor and the author of a recent biography of Mr. Netanyahu, \u201cCracking the Netanyahu Code,\u201d referring to him by his nickname. Mr. Netanyahu does not always go along with their demands, Ms. Mualem said, and often must juggle things at home.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt they are influential,\u201d she added of Sara and Yair Netanyahu, \u201cfor better and for worse.\u201d Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s corruption trial has also highlighted unflattering accusations about the family, with key witnesses testifying about demands made by the household to wealthy businesspeople for deliveries of crates of champagne, luxury cigars and jewelry. Mr. Netanyahu denies all wrongdoing and says the cases against him are collapsing in court. Some of the most sensational accounts of goings-on in the household and interference in decision-making came out during a libel suit that the Netanyahu family brought against Ehud Olmert, a former prime minister, after he described them as being \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Called to testify by the defense, Nir Hefetz, a former Netanyahu confidant and, from 2014 to 2018, a spokesman for the family who later turned state\u2019s witness in the corruption trial, told the court that Yair Netanyahu once burst into a meeting that his father was holding with officials including Moshe Kahlon, the finance minister, about a plan to turn Israel\u2019s broadcasting authority into a corporation.\n\nBut the person close to the Netanyahu family said he had personally seen Mr. Netanyahu clear all non-relevant people, including his son, out of the room when he needed to make decisions. Mr. Hefetz is suing Yair Netanyahu in another case for an alleged breach of his privacy in several social media posts. Mr. Hefetz also sold his diaries and hours of tape recordings, including private conversations with Ms. Netanyahu, to an Israeli TV network, Channel 13, and gave a lengthy interview that ran before the election. He recounted how he was called by an aide of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s to intervene in 2017 when his son had urged him, against the advice of the security services, not to remove metal detectors at the entrances of the Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem that had been the source of days of violent protests. That advice was ultimately ignored, and the detectors were removed. Mr. Hefetz also said that Yair Netanyahu persuaded his father to give a hero\u2019s welcome to an Israeli security guard who had been involved in a confrontation at the Israeli Embassy in Amman, Jordan, that led to the deaths of two Jordanians, exacerbating a diplomatic crisis with the country. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud party responded to the Channel 13 program in a statement saying, \u201cHow many more times will we have to hear this recycled nonsense?\u201d and describing it as biased and based on \u201cold, moldy rumors and false gossip.\u201d",

            "section": "New York",
            "content": "The sentencing was part of a precipitous fall for Allen H. Weisselberg, who like other Trump insiders had his misdeeds placed under a microscope and lost his freedom.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAllen H. Weisselberg served the family company for decades but agreed to testify about its tax fraud in exchange for a lighter punishment.\n\nAllen H. Weisselberg, once one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s most loyal lieutenants, was sentenced on Tuesday to five months at the Rikers Island jail complex for his role in a tax fraud scheme that led to the conviction of the Trump Organization last year. A state court judge handed down the sentence after Mr. Weisselberg, 75, who worked for the Trump family for the past half-century, testified as the prosecution\u2019s star witness at the trial of the company. Mr. Weisselberg, its former chief financial officer, had been facing years in prison. Under a plea deal, he agreed to testify truthfully in exchange for a punishment that, with good behavior, might last no more than 100 days. Still, Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s lawyer, Nicholas A. Gravante Jr., pleaded with the judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Tuesday to impose a lighter sentence, citing his client\u2019s military service, lack of a criminal record and the many hours he had spent with prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office preparing for the testimony. But the judge, Juan Merchan, rejected the defense\u2019s request and said that had he not promised the sentence of five months in August, the evidence at trial would have prompted him to impose a significantly longer sentence. \u201cThe entire case was driven by greed,\u201d Justice Merchan said.\n\nMr. Weisselberg initially will be assigned to the North Infirmary Command, a jail on Rikers Island that houses people with serious medical conditions as well as a portion of the general population. Once the hearing concluded, Mr. Weisselberg, wearing an olive North Face jacket and dark sneakers, hugged Mr. Gravante and was placed in handcuffs by court officers and taken into custody. The district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was in the courtroom for the sentencing, sitting near the back with a sober expression on his face. \u201cIn Manhattan, you have to play by the rules no matter who you are or who you work for,\u201d Mr. Bragg said in a statement. Noting the company\u2019s conviction at trial, he added, \u201cThese consequential felony convictions put on full display the inner workings of former President Trump\u2019s companies and its C.F.O.\u2019s actions.\u201d The sentencing punctuated a precipitous fall for Mr. Weisselberg, who like other Trump insiders before him, had his misdeeds placed under a microscope and ultimately lost his freedom, collateral damage from a wider investigation into Mr. Trump himself. Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime fixer, served time in federal prison, as did the former president\u2019s campaign chairman, underscoring the perils of associating with Mr. Trump, whose campaign, presidency and family business have been magnets for law enforcement scrutiny. As an older man with frail health, Mr. Weisselberg faces particularly stark consequences: He will serve time at a notorious jail complex where more than a dozen people died last year, with no promise that the district attorney will forgo additional charges against him.\n\nHis ties to the Trumps are also becoming tenuous. After a decades-long entanglement with Mr. Weisselberg, who got his start as a bookkeeper for Mr. Trump\u2019s father in the 1970s, the Trump Organization has parted ways with him as of Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He has been on paid leave and recently received his annual bonus from the company for last year, one of the people said. He is expected to receive a broader severance package as well. The company has good reason not to alienate Mr. Weisselberg. While his testimony helped convict the Trump Organization, a cardinal sin for the family and those close to it, he has refused to turn on Mr. Trump to assist Mr. Bragg\u2019s broader investigation into the former president. Mr. Weisselberg, who initially held the title of controller and eventually became chief financial officer, also logged decades of service in which he created the Trump Organization\u2019s accounting department and helped bring the company back from the brink of bankruptcy. And as the district attorney\u2019s inquiry remains active, with prosecutors interested in Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s help as they investigate Mr. Trump for his role in hush-money payments made to a porn star during his 2016 presidential campaign, it would be risky to cast him aside. After the sentencing, Mr. Gravante said on the courthouse steps that Mr. Weisselberg \u201cdeeply regrets the lapse in judgment that resulted in his conviction, and he regrets it most because of the pain it has caused his loving wife, his sons and wonderful grandchildren,\u201d adding that he \u201calso regrets the harm his actions have caused to the Trump Organization and members of the Trump family.\u201d Mr. Weisselberg, Mr. Gravante said, \u201cis grateful to them for their continued support throughout this difficult chapter of his life.\u201d As part of Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s plea deal \u2014 which required him to plead guilty to scheming to defraud, grand larceny, conspiracy and tax fraud \u2014 he already paid New York authorities more than $2 million in taxes, penalties and interest that he owed after reaping lavish off-the-books perks from Mr. Trump and his company. Those perks, which were at the center of the prosecution\u2019s case, included leased Mercedes-Benzes, an apartment on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side and private school tuition for his grandchildren.\n\nThe company, which was convicted on all 17 counts of tax fraud and other financial crimes, will be sentenced on Friday. It faces up to $1.6 million in penalties. Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s testimony at trial, which spanned three days in November, was crucial for prosecutors, who had argued that the executive had manipulated his pay to avoid his full tax burden and had done so in part to benefit the company. In one instance, Mr. Weisselberg told jurors that, after receiving money from Mr. Trump to pay his grandchildren\u2019s private school tuition, he had made sure to reimburse the organization. \u201cThe amount of money I was being given was too much, and I thought the right thing to do was pay the company back,\u201d Mr. Weisselberg said. Toward the end of the trial, a prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, compared Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s motivations to that of a musician. \u201cA professional musician in an orchestra, she plays the best she can because she wants to succeed,\u201d Mr. Steinglass said, adding, \u201cBut an ancillary benefit is that it makes the whole orchestra sound better.\u201d As it investigated Mr. Trump\u2019s business practices, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office initially took aim at Mr. Weisselberg in early 2021, seeing him as the potential linchpin in a case against the former president.",

That angered the families, their lawyers and gun control groups, who saw the case as a critical test of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to addressing the government\u2019s responsibility to keep weapons out of the hands of mass shooters.",

But can this spiny sea vegetable really help you heal your gut, lose weight, strengthen your immune system and more?\n\nIn videos on TikTok, influencers wince as they dig spoons into jars of what looks like slime. Sometimes the glop is pale green or yellow, sometimes it\u2019s deep red. Some people wrinkle their noses and grimace as they swallow a dollop; others sniff their spoons and grin into the camera. \u201cIt kind of smells like ocean water,\u201d one woman said before choking down a glob and then covering her mouth, appearing to gag, eyes watering. \u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d she said flatly and unconvincingly, blinking away tears. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it every day.\u201d They are among a number of people online who have been promoting the health benefits of sea moss \u2014 an edible sea vegetable in the algae family that is packed with nutrients like folate, vitamin K, vitamin B, iron, iodine, magnesium, zinc and calcium. While the plant can be consumed raw and in supplement form \u2014 including as pills, powders and gummies \u2014 it\u2019s most often eaten as a gel, made by soaking the dried plant in water, blending it and letting it coalesce in the fridge. Some claim that a scoop or more per day can heal their gut, clear their skin, regulate their menstrual cycle, strengthen their immune system or help them shed pounds. But is this hype based on science? Here\u2019s what to know before slurping down a spoonful. Sea moss is a spiky, frilly sea vegetable that somewhat resembles fris\u00e9e lettuce when it\u2019s in the ocean. It thrives along the Atlantic coasts, mainly between North America and Europe, and in the warm waters of Asia, South America, Africa and parts of the Caribbean. When dried and packaged, the plant looks like cooked ramen noodles, with tangled tendrils that clump together. Food manufacturers harvest it for its carrageenan, an ingredient that acts as a thickening agent for foods like ice cream, chocolate milk and creamers.\n\nBut because it\u2019s so nutrient-rich, people sometimes eat it in hopes of improving their health \u2014 swirling the gel into smoothies, blending it into puddings or eating it straight from a jar. The gel often tastes fishy and has a slick, slimy texture. Raw sea moss can also have an earthy, ocean-like taste, not unlike an oyster or a clam \u2014 which can be off-putting to some, said Brooke Levine, a dietitian nutritionist at NYU Langone Health. When did sea moss become so popular? Sea moss has received a number of celebrity endorsements on social media in recent years. In 2020, Kim Kardashian shared on Twitter that she drank sea moss smoothies as part of her diet; last summer, Erewhon Market, a grocery chain based in Los Angeles, released \u201cHailey Bieber\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie\u201d \u2014 complete with sea moss gel. The rapper Meek Mill mused online in 2019 that maybe sea moss made him smarter, and in 2021, the former Disney Channel actress Skai Jackson said she ate sea moss \u201cevery single day.\u201d Sea moss also gained attention last fall when a flurry of panicky social media posts from fans of the plant claimed that the Food and Drug Administration was going to ban all sea moss products, possibly because of certain unproven health claims. While the F.D.A. has issued warning letters to makers of sea moss-containing products in the past (including to a company that claimed its product could prevent or treat Covid-19), the posts about the ban turned out to be based on misinformation. But the passionate reactions of some users showed just how fervent a following the plant had gained.\n\nBut while nutrition experts say that the nutrients in sea moss might offer some health benefits, the hype is probably overblown, Dr. Ring said. \u201cLike all of the superfoods that have come and gone, there\u2019s some truth to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a magical thing that everyone should be taking.\u201d No clinical trials have investigated whether sea moss is beneficial for humans, Ms. Levine said, though seaweed in general has been well researched: It\u2019s packed with vitamins and minerals similar to those found in sea moss, and some studies suggest that certain fatty acids and vitamins in some types of seaweed, like omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins D and B12, can help strengthen the immune system. But without hard and fast data on sea moss itself, Dr. Ring said, its health effects aren\u2019t totally clear. Besides, Ms. Levine said, you\u2019re most likely already getting the same nutrients found in sea moss if you follow a well-balanced diet. And if you don\u2019t, she said, consuming sea moss won\u2019t counteract poor nutrition choices. \u201cIt won\u2019t help to eat sea moss gel if you\u2019re getting a Big Mac,\u201d Ms. Levine said. Instead of turning to sea moss for a nutritional boost, she said, a few rolls of sushi containing seaweed can help supply comparable amounts of B vitamins and zinc. You can also get many of the nutrients in sea moss from leafy greens like kale, arugula or Swiss chard, said Mary Ellen DiPaola, a senior outpatient dietitian at the University of California, San Francisco. Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, agreed. \u201cWhen a patient comes to me and says, \u2018I saw this on TikTok, I\u2019m thinking about taking it,\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s great, how about having more broccoli?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCan sea moss help you lose weight? Despite what some people are saying online, sea moss won\u2019t suddenly speed up your metabolism, Ms. Kirkpatrick said. It does, however, contain plenty of prebiotic fiber, a food source for the good bacteria in your gut, which can help regulate your digestive system, she said. Theoretically, sea moss gel could contribute to weight loss because its goopy consistency makes it slow to leave our stomachs, keeping us fuller for longer, Dr. Ring said, but it\u2019s not guaranteed. Can sea moss keep you from getting sick? The individual nutrients found in sea moss \u2014 like B vitamins and zinc \u2014 indicate that, theoretically, the gel could help support your immune system, Dr. Ring said. But without data or clinical trials, there\u2019s no proof that sea moss can prevent or cure any disease. Are there risks associated with eating sea moss? Sea moss contains high levels of iodine, which can damage your thyroid if consumed in large quantities, Dr. Ring said. If you want to try it, she recommended taking no more than two tablespoons of the gel at a time and using it every other day, rather than every day. Like seaweed, sea moss may contain trace amounts of heavy metals like aluminum or cadmium, depending on where it\u2019s grown. So you should be careful to not overdo it, Dr. Ring said. If you\u2019re taking sea moss in supplement form, keep in mind that the F.D.A. does not strictly regulate supplements, so you can never be 100 percent sure that what is stated online or on a package is what\u2019s in the product. Is sea moss worth shelling out for? A bag of the dried plant, which you can use to make sea moss gel at home, can be expensive. Some sellers on Amazon list it for around $20 per pound, others for around $80 per pound. A 16-ounce jug of premade gel can run around $15 on the lower end, or $60 on the higher end.",

These were not the actual philosophers but virtual recreations, brought to conversation, if not quite life, by sophisticated chatbots on a website called Character.AI. Mr. Thiel\u2019s favorite was a bot that imitated Karl Kautsky, a Czech-Austrian socialist who died before World War Two. When Mr. Thiel asked Kautsky\u2019s digital avatar to provide some advice for modern-day socialists struggling to rebuild the worker\u2019s movement in Germany, Kautsky-bot suggested that they launch a newspaper. \u201cThey can use it not only as a means of spreading socialist propaganda, which is in short supply in Germany for the time being, but also to organize working class people,\u201d the bot said. Kautsky-bot went on to argue that the working classes would eventually \u201ccome to their senses\u201d and embrace a modern-day Marxist revolution. \u201cThe proletariat is at a low point in their history right now,\u201d it wrote. \u201cThey will eventually realize the flaws in capitalism, especially because of climate change.\u201d Over the course of several days, Mr. Thiel met with other virtual scholars, including G.A. Cohen and Adolph Reed Jr. But he could have picked almost anyone, live or dead, real or imagined. At Character.AI, which emerged this summer, users can chat with reasonable facsimiles of everyone from Queen Elizabeth or William Shakespeare to Billie Eilish or Elon Musk (there are several versions). Anyone you want to invoke, or concoct, is available for conversation. The company and site, founded by Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazeer, two former Google researchers, is among the many efforts to build a new kind of chatbot. These bots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to.\n\nIn late November, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, unveiled a bot called ChatGPT that left more than a million people feeling as if they were chatting with another human being. Similar technologies are under development at Google, Meta and other tech giants. Some companies have been reluctant to share the technology with the wider public. Because these bots learn their skills from data posted to the internet by real people, they often generate untruths, hate speech and language that is biased against women and people of color. If misused, they could become a more efficient way of running the kind of misinformation campaign that has become commonplace in recent years. \u201cWithout any additional guardrails in place, they are just going to end up reflecting all the biases and toxic information that is already on the web,\u201d said Margaret Mitchell, a former A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped start its Ethical A.I. team. She is now with the A.I. start-up Hugging Face. But other companies, including Character.AI, are confident that the public will learn to accept the flaws of chatbots and develop a healthy distrust of what they say. Mr. Thiel found that the bots at Character.AI had both a talent for conversation and a knack for impersonating real-life people. \u201cIf you read what someone like Kautsky wrote in the 19th century, he does not use the same language we use today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the A.I. can somehow translate his ideas into ordinary modern English.\u201d For the moment, these and other advanced chatbots are a source of entertainment. And they are quickly becoming a more powerful way of interacting with machines. Experts are still debating whether the strengths of these technologies will outweigh their flaws and potential for harm, but they agree on one point: The believability of make-believe conversation will continue to improve.\n\nIn 2015 Mr. De Freitas, then working as a software engineer at Microsoft, read a research paper published by scientists at Google Brain, the flagship artificial intelligence lab at Google. Detailing what it called \u201cA Neural Conversational Model,\u201d the paper showed how a machine could learn the art of conversation by analyzing dialogue transcripts from hundreds of movies. The San Francisco company is one of the world\u2019s most ambitious artificial intelligence labs. Here\u2019s a look at some recent developments.\n\u2022 None ChatGPT: The cutting-edge chatbot is raising fears of students cheating on their homework. But its potential as an educational tool outweighs its risks, The cutting-edge chatbot is raising fears of students cheating on their homework. But its potential as an educational tool outweighs its risks, our technology columnist writes\n\u2022 None DALL-E 2: The system lets you create digital images simply by The system lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see . But for some, image generators are worrisome\n\u2022 None GPT-3: With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can write, argue and code . The implications for the future could be profound The paper described what A.I. researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the brain. This same technology also translates between Spanish and English on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians and traffic signs for self-driving cars navigating city streets. A neural network learns skills by pinpointing patterns in enormous amounts of digital data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat. The neural system described in the Google paper was far from perfect but seemed to chat like a real person every once in a while: Human: what \u2019s your name ? Human: when were you born ? Human: what year were you born ? Human: where are you from ? Machine: i \u2019m out in the boonies. Human: are you a man or a woman ? When Mr. De Freitas read the paper, he was not yet an A.I. researcher; he was a software engineer working on search engines. But what he really wanted was to take Google\u2019s idea to its logical extreme. \u201cYou could tell this bot could generalize,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it said did not look like what was in a movie script.\u201d He moved to Google in 2017. Officially, he was an engineer on YouTube, the company\u2019s video-sharing site. But for his \u201c20 percent time\u201d project \u2014 a Google tradition that lets employees explore new ideas alongside their daily obligations \u2014 he began building his own chatbot. The idea was to train a neural network using a much larger collection of dialogue: reams of chat logs culled from social media services and other sites across the internet. The idea was simple, but it would require enormous amounts of computer processing power. Even a supercomputer would need weeks or even months to analyze all that data.\n\nAs a Google engineer, he held a few credits that allowed him to run experimental software across the company\u2019s vast network of computer data centers. But these credits would grant only a small fraction of the computing power needed to train his chatbot. So he started borrowing credits from other engineers; as the system analyzed more data, its skills would improve by leaps and bounds. Initially, he trained his chatbot using what is called an LSTM, for Long Short-Term Memory \u2014 a neural network designed in the 1990s specifically for natural language. But he soon switched to a new kind of neural network called a transformer, developed by a team of Google A.I. researchers that included Noam Shazeer. Unlike an LSTM, which reads text one word at a time, a transformer can use multiple computer processors to analyze an entire document in a single step. Google, OpenAI and other organizations were already using transformers to build what are called \u201clarge language models,\u201d systems suited for a wide range of language tasks, from writing tweets to answering questions. Still working on his own, Mr. De Freitas focused the idea on conversation, feeding his transformer as much dialogue as possible. It was an exceedingly simple approach. But as Mr. De Freitas likes to say: \u201cSimple solutions for incredible results.\u201d The result in this case was a chatbot that he called Meena. It was so effective that Google Brain hired Mr. De Freitas and turned his project into an official research effort. Meena became LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The project spilled into the public consciousness early last summer when another Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, told The Washington Post that LaMDA was sentient. This assertion was an exaggeration, to say the least. But the brouhaha showed how quickly chatbots were improving inside top labs like Google Brain and OpenAI.\n\nIt has learned from reams of general dialogue as well as from articles, news stories, books and other digital text describing people like Elon Musk, Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare. The system also has a way of combining disparate concepts learned during training. The result is a practically endless collection of bots that can imitate a practically endless collection of people, riffing on a practically endless number of topics, as Mr. Thiel found when he chatted with the Karl Kautsky bot: JonasThiel: Marxists in your time were very confident that revolution was a historical inevitability. In light of recent defeats socialists across the world have suffered and the lack of class struggle, even in times of great suffering, do you think it is time to revise that view? Karl Kautsky: I do not. We may have made mistakes with our tactics, but I refuse to believe that socialism is a pipe dream. I still believe that the proletariat must break the chains of capitalism, and that the working class must unite around marxism. We must remember that capitalism is still deeply flawed and that it is our job as socialists to agitate and spread class consciousness. JonasThiel: I completely agree, but wasn\u2019t it wrong to assume workers uniting to overthrow the bourgeoisie was inevitable? After all, the capitalist class is very powerful and it is hard for workers to come together to resist collectively rather than individually. Karl Kautsky: You are right, it was a mistake to be over optimistic in that regard. But I find it better to believe in class consciousness and revolution until I am proven wrong. What is the alternative? Believing the workers will stay in chains forever? I don\u2019t agree with that. It is better to struggle against capitalism despite our odds then to give in. I refuse to believe the workers will never wake up. Even if I am over optimistic, we must not give in to pessimism. I refuse to be proved wrong. I hope you can understand. Sometimes, the chatbot gets things right. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t. When Mr. Thiel chatted with an avatar meant to imitate Mr. Reed, the 20th-century American political thinker, it turned him into \u201csome kind of militant Maoist, which is definitely not right.\u201d Like Google and OpenAI and other top labs, Mr. De Freitas, Mr. Shazeer and their colleagues plan on training their system with ever larger amounts of digital data. This training can take months, and millions of dollars; it can also sharpen the skills of the artificial conversationalist. Researchers say that the rapid improvement of the past several years will last only so long. Richard Socher, former head of A.I. at Salesforce who now runs a start-up called You.com, believes these exponential improvements will begin to level off over the next few years, when language models reach a point when they have analyzed pretty much all the text on the internet. But Mr. Shazeer believes the runway is much longer. \u201cThere are billions of people in the world generating text all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will keep spending more and more money to train smarter and smarter systems. We are nowhere near the end of that trend.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nHey, it\u2019s me again, filling in for our mutual friend, Nikita. Our inbox was full of reader questions, and I\u2019m jumping in with some answers. This time, we\u2019ve got requests for late-night downtown dining, worthy weekday lunch spots and kid-friendly venues in the theater district. As always, if you have your own recommendations or questions, send Nikita an email at wheretoeat@nytimes.com. While you\u2019re at it, tell her we miss her and desperately crave her vibes, OK? (She\u2019ll be back next week.)\n\nOn our way back to the West Village after a performance uptown, my friend and I had a weeknight yen for some interesting appetizers and a glass of wine in a quiet, tablecloth spot. It was after 10 p.m., and we were informed that the kitchen was closed at place after place. Finally defaulted to a quieter outside table at White Horse Tavern, but one look at the appetizers and lack of a wine list when we sat down, and we headed elsewhere. Dante was still going but packed and noisy, so we just headed home. Any options? Ah, been there. You\u2019d think it would be easier to find a spot to linger late in such a dense restaurant neighborhood. (New York is no longer the \u201ccity that never sleeps,\u201d as Dodai Stewart wrote in The Times in September.) Next time, try Moonflower on West 11th Street, a charming natural wine bar with snacks like cured trout and labneh on potato chips and buttery shrimp with garlic toast. It\u2019s open until midnight on school nights (except Mondays) and 2 a.m. on weekends. B\u2019artusi, in the West Village, is also open until midnight every night, and the kitchen serves arancini with Calabrian chile aioli, and buttermilk-laced fluke crudo until 11 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I had our first child in May, and as delightful as she is, her 7 p.m. bedtime makes it difficult to try all the N.Y.C. restaurants we want to visit. Occasionally we\u2019ll have some free time with grandparents on baby duty, but that seems to fall in the afternoon on weekdays when many restaurants are closed. Do you have any recommendations of the best restaurants in the city that do a weekday lunch service? Congratulations on your little one! And R.I.P. to your nights out on the town. Lunch at Atla, in NoHo, never feels like a ghost town \u2014 I actually think the windowed space lends itself better to lunch plans than dinner. A meal of aguachile, potato flautas and mole short rib is just as lovely with a coconut milk caf\u00e9 con leche as it is with a mezcal-tomato cocktail. Also in NoHo is the first New York outpost of the Los Angeles favorite Gjelina. The sprawling two-story space evokes \u201cleisurely lunch\u201d in a very Californian way, and lunch dishes can be light (Asian pear and kohlrabi salad, avocado and sprouts sandwich) or closer to dinner-size (tilefish with romesco, chorizo pizza). For something even more opulent, head to Frenchette in TriBeCa, admittedly a tough place to secure a dinner reservation, for gnocchi with ham and Comt\u00e9 or a midday duck hach\u00e9.\n\nIs there any place fun to take a child for lunch pretheater (matinee)? I don\u2019t mean fast food, I mean something fun. I seem to recall going to Rumpelmayer\u2019s when I was a child. Anything like that now? This one is a toughie for me, mostly because the site of my own pretheater childhood memories, Mars 2112, no longer exists. Lillie\u2019s Victorian Establishment, in the theater district, scratches the itch for a charming themed restaurant, decked out in marble columns and stained glass. They have tea service from Tuesday through Friday, including a three-tier cake stand with finger sandwiches.",

            "content": "What do you think life in 2023 will look like? What will we wear this year? What words will we use? What foods will we eat? What other trends will we see?\n\nIn \u201c13 Predictions for Life in 2023,\u201d the Styles desk delivers some of its best guesses for what\u2019s in store. Here are a few:\n\nImprecise by design, \u201cvibes\u201d defined our vague feelings of uneasiness in the beginning of the pandemic. The \u201cvibes are off,\u201d my friend Steve Macfarlane, who works in the film department at the Museum of Modern Art, wrote in a viral tweet he now regrets, describing the atmosphere of summer 2021. Not long after, there came news of a \u201cvibe shift\u201d gathering on the horizon. Writers and critics tried to pin down exactly what vibes were, but the word remained slippery and, at least for me, frustratingly overused. There will always be a term to account for that which we can\u2019t clearly express in the moment \u2014 in the 2010s it was \u201cmood\u201d \u2014 but at a certain point, mere \u201cvibes\u201d crystallize into hard facts, and we\u2019re forced to look around and evaluate the circumstances of our lives. \u2014 Marie Solis, editing resident Two million people watched a TikTok featuring cozy crochet covers for headphones created by Alexandria Masse, a textile artist. A post about a teacher who turned her students\u2019 drawings into plush toys spread widely on Twitter. Even the concept cars at the trade show CES in early January were mostly rounded with bubble wheels. A soft-rock documentary series, \u201cSometimes When We Touch,\u201d just debuted on TV. Soft boys and soft girls may have been gaining momentum for a while, but this is the year we all go soft. \u2014 Dodai Stewart, Metro writer at large The years 2016 to 2022 were marked by a high level of chaos, with the pandemic as the peak of four years of incoherent yelling. In 2023, as I observe people of all political stripes repelled by the spectacle of a Congress unable to choose a leader, I foresee a move away from the strife and dysfunction. Americans are going to gravitate toward media, experiences and political figures that are just regular degular and rather wholesome. More \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d and \u201cTicket to Paradise.\u201d More Luddite teens starting book clubs and staring at the stars. Less of the extreme and more of the everyday pleasures. \u2014 Jessica Grose, opinion writer Thrift stores may no longer offer the inexpensive hidden gems that they did 10 years ago, but they still provide plenty of raw material to shred, dye, bead, appliqu\u00e9, paint, patch or otherwise mess with to create one-of-a-kind statement pieces. I\u2019m expecting my TikTok algorithm to deliver more tutorials on how to turn a T-shirt into a dress, and I foresee craft night invitations in the place of clothing swaps. Amid a collective nostalgia for the early aughts, it\u2019s as good a time as any to embrace uneven hems and unfinished edges. \u2014 Shane O\u2019Neill, senior video editor It\u2019s notably weird when someone next to you on the subway or at a restaurant strikes up a conversation, no matter how innocuous. I anticipate, perhaps somewhat wishfully, that 2023 will change that. More strangers in public settings will start conversing with one another on matters small and large. It will make us feel like we\u2019re all living in this world together rather than going about it ourselves, and new ideas will be spread and debated like we\u2019re in one never-ending French salon. \u2014 Anna Kod\u00e9, real estate reporter\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\u2022 None Which predictions on this list do you agree with? Which do you disagree with, and why?\n\u2022 None Make your own predictions for 2023. What, in your opinion, will be in for this year? What will be out? Like the Styles desk, you can base your guesses on trends you\u2019re seeing on social media, events in the news, what\u2019s happening in your school or community or even what you would simply like to see happen. And you can include anything you want \u2014 whether it\u2019s related to fashion, language, culture, food, sports, technology or something else.\n\u2022 None Choose one prediction from your list and explain it in more detail.

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAfter a student complained that her art history professor\u2019s showing of a 14th-century image of the Prophet Muhammad (one shown regularly in art history classes) was deeply offensive to Muslims, the professor was told by school officials \u201cthat her services next semester were no longer needed.\u201d Never mind that Erika L\u00f3pez Prater was teaching appropriate course material, or that she had given ample warnings, both in class and on her syllabus, that if any student found images of holy figures insensitive to contact her with any concerns or to feel free to leave the class before they were shown. Or that her department chair initially backed her 100 percent. She was dismissed because adjuncts are disposable; they can be fired, for anything. But the administration of Hamline University, where Dr. L\u00f3pez Prater taught, should know all too well how needed adjuncts are. Like so many colleges and universities across our country, they worry about shrinking enrollments and growing costs. Adjuncts are cheap; they teach at a fraction of the salary of full-time faculty. The ratio of adjunct to full-time faculty in American colleges is shockingly high. They are a way to penny pinch in a climate where administrative salaries drain budgets and where parents are fed up with astronomical tuition costs.\n\nCathy Bernard\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer was a tenured associate professor of English at the New York Institute of Technology. The fight over free speech rights and academic freedom at Hamline University underscores several problems facing higher education in America. Years ago I drafted Hamline\u2019s civility code. It states in part, \u201cThe University embraces the examination of all ideas, some of which will potentially be unpopular and unsettling, as an integral and robust component of intellectual inquiry.\u201d In drafting it, I was guided by a couple of principles. One, schools are mini-democracies. They should inculcate the type of virtues in students we would expect them to display as citizens in a democracy. Instead they are now captured by the polarization, culture wars and interest groups that plague America. Two, we live in a pluralistic society where not all of us share similar views on controversial issues. Education is not a pep rally; learning demands confronting contrary viewpoints.\n\nAs I emphasize in my classes (one of which was featured in this newspaper), education is about recognizing context. Presentation of controversial ideas in an academic context is different from proselytizing hate. Universities face fiscal and enrollment challenges. Some will pick and choose whose speech to privilege in order to placate donors and students. This is the wrong approach. Schools must respect neutrality and allow for all voices and opinions in the pursuit of truth of inquiry. David Schultz\n\nSt. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe writer is a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. Did Erika L\u00f3pez Prater\u2019s decision to display the painting of the Prophet Muhammad support student learning and success or compromise the learning environment? Educators should care for students as much as art, and keep an open mind about their approach. During class, Dr. L\u00f3pez Prater could have provided a link to the painting, offering options to participate by viewing or listening (as it\u2019s unfair to ask students to leave the class). Before offering such options, educators can seek guidance from experts with different perspectives as well as from students themselves, through one-to-one conversations, written reflections, anonymous surveys or dialogues with student organizations. Ultimately what matters most is the students\u2019 right to a quality education, which requires taking their needs into account and not forcing them to adopt an educator\u2019s choice of whether or how to perceive an object. A truly just and fair education enables freedom of thought and expression for all. Aram Wedatalla, the student who objected to the showing of the painting, courageously expressed her viewpoint, thus opening a broader and necessary conversation about what inclusion really means.\n\nCatherine Elizabeth DeLazzero\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer is an educational researcher who has taught in high schools and universities. As a Muslim professor, I\u2019m so angry at the Hamline University administration about this firing! I admit that I\u2019m not too religious anymore, but I still cannot look at a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. However, the students were given ample information on the syllabus and in the class prior to the image being shown. They can hardly claim to be \u201cblindsided.\u201d My take is that the Muslim students are feeling let down by their university for other reasons and they took out their frustration on an adjunct faculty member. The administration took the easy way out by firing her. Seyda Ipek\n\nOttawa\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor of physics at Carleton University. There are many disturbing aspects of this sad story, but what concerns me most is the apparent inability to acknowledge that more than one truth can exist simultaneously, even when they are not in complete alignment. In the rush to identify villains and heroes, we lose sight of the complicated possibility that a) the professor was justified and well intentioned and b) the student was nevertheless genuinely offended by the professor\u2019s decision to show the image. Or that a) the professor gave opt-out options in advance but b) the student didn\u2019t feel empowered to exercise them fully.\n\nIf the university had begun with a presumption that all of these things were simultaneously true and had attempted to find a better conflict resolution process along the lines of restorative justice, both the student and the professor might have felt that they had benefited from the conflict. Instead, we go back and forth between dichotomous positions of right and wrong, villain and victim, oppressor and oppressed, and we end up not with progress toward unity but rather with more deeply entrenched differences. The G.O.P. vs. the I.R.S.\n\nRe \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like to Be Queer in Alabama,\u201d by Lydia Polgreen (column, Jan. 8): Thank you for this pointed and poignant opinion piece about L.G.B.T.Q. life in Alabama. Having lived in Birmingham, Ala., for a season, I was brought to tears by the tenderness with which she portrayed this often overlooked yet vibrant queer community. I\u2019m a lifelong Southerner who, like many queers, has fled to Atlanta for its relative community and safety. Even so, Birmingham and Alabama hold a special place in my heart, and I\u2019m gratified to see them represented with the nuance and respect they deserve.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWith more than 700 people arrested after supporters of Jair Bolsonaro ransacked Brazil\u2019s seats of government, the authorities began to search for those who funded and aided the rioters.\n\nBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 Brazilian authorities on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for two government security officials, zeroed in on people suspected of funding this week\u2019s violent protests and asked a federal court to freeze the assets of the far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a broad expansion of the investigation into the invasion of Brazil\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices by protesters on Sunday. The moves showed that, a day after arresting hundreds of people suspected of taking part in Sunday\u2019s riot in Brazil\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s top officials have now turned their focus to the political and business elites suspected of inspiring, organizing or aiding the rioters. Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, issued the warrants for the two security officials, including Anderson Torres, the man effectively in charge of security for the capital, in response to a request by the federal police. Mr. Moraes, a controversial figure who has been accused of severely overstepping his authority, said that investigators had evidence that the officials knew violence was brewing but did nothing to stop it. He said that they were under investigation for terrorism, criminal association and offenses related to the violent overthrow of democracy.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, a top public prosecutor asked a federal court to freeze the assets of Mr. Bolsonaro in relation to the investigation into the riots, though his office declined to explain why. The protesters invaded the government buildings under the false belief that October\u2019s presidential election, which Mr. Bolsonaro lost, was rigged, their actions spurred in part because of his yearslong efforts to undermine the electorate\u2019s faith in Brazil\u2019s election systems. The request to freeze Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s assets is now in the hands of a judge, but it is unclear whether the court has the legal power to block his accounts. And freezing assets, even if it were not challenged in court, could prove a lengthy and complex process. Authorities are also expected to take action against more than 100 companies thought to have helped the protesters, including many believed to have transported rioters to the capital or to have provided them with free food and shelter, according to Brazilian media reports.\n\nBoth Mr. Dino and President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva have said that they believe prominent players in the country\u2019s powerful agriculture industry, which largely backed Mr. Bolsonaro in the election, played a role. Thousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Mass Attack: After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede. Here is what went wrong\n\u2022 None The Investigations: Authorities face Authorities face several major questions as they piece together how rioters briefly seized the seats of Brazil\u2019s government.\n\u2022 None Digital Playbook: Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Misinformation researchers are studying how the internet was used ahead of the riots in Brazil. Many are drawing a comparison to the Jan. 6 attack\n\u2022 None The Role of the Police: Their early inaction in the riot shows Their early inaction in the riot shows how security forces can help empower violence and deepen the threat to democracy. \u201cThese people were there today, the agribusiness,\u201d Mr. Lula said after the attacks, adding that \u201call these people will be investigated, found out, and will be punished.\u201d The moves highlighted the growing scope of the hunt to identify the ideological, logistical and financial architects of Sunday\u2019s chaos, the worst attack on Brazil\u2019s institutions since a military dictatorship ended in 1985. Many people who participated in the riots had been camped out for weeks outside the Army headquarters in Bras\u00edlia, espousing the false claim that October\u2019s election was stolen and calling for the military to step in. Military and independent experts found no credible evidence of voter fraud in the election, in which Mr. Lula, a leftist former president, defeated Mr. Bolsonaro. Mr. Lula took office on Jan. 1. While Mr. Bolsonaro had for years asserted, without evidence, that Brazil\u2019s election systems were plagued by fraud, after the election he authorized the transition of power to Mr. Lula. Mr. Bolsonaro, who has been in the United States since before the inauguration, criticized the rioters on Sunday, saying that peaceful demonstrations were part of democracy but the \u201cdestruction and invasions of public buildings\u201d was not. In the wake of the riot, investigators are grappling with difficult questions about why rioters were able to enter federal government buildings so easily \u2014 and whether security authorities were blindsided, negligent or somehow complicit.\n\nYet upon taking the new job, Mr. Torres quickly dismissed several key officials in his staff and then left for a vacation to Florida, leaving him out of the state during Sunday\u2019s protests, according to Ricardo Cappelli, who has temporarily replaced Mr. Torres under an emergency decree signed by Mr. Lula. In an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo on Tuesday, Mr. Cappelli said that in the days ahead of the large planned protests on Sunday, Mr. Torres assured the federal government that his team was in control. \u201cWhat reached us was information saying that everything was fine, that the demonstration would be peaceful and that the troops would guarantee it,\u201d he said. In comments to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Cappelli accused Mr. Torres of purposefully \u201csabotaging\u201d the security around the protests. As soon as Mr. Torres took over on Jan. 2, he said, \u201cChaos ensues. Coincidence? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Federal officials have also said that, during a planning meeting two days before the protests, Mr. Torres and other officials promised a far more robust security presence during the demonstrations than what they delivered.\n\nState officials have said they accepted responsibility for the failures, but have not explained why security was light, despite warnings of the possibility of violent protests. Mr. Torres said on Twitter that he would cut his vacation short and return to Brazil to defend himself. \u201cI have always guided my actions with ethics and legality. I believe in the Brazilian justice system and in the strength of the institutions. I am certain that the truth will prevail,\u201d he said. Mr. Torres has long been a close ally of Mr. Bolsonaro. As the former president\u2019s justice minister, Mr. Torres was a key player in the attacks against Brazil\u2019s electronic voting machines. In July 2021, Mr. Bolsonaro announced that he would lay out his full case on why Brazil\u2019s election system was rife with fraud. In a subsequent two-hour livestream, Mr. Torres sat next to him and presented videos claiming to show how voting machines could be hacked, which security experts later debunked.\n\nResponding to requests from the federal police, Mr. Moraes issued warrants for the arrest of Mr. Torres and Fabio Augusto Vieira, the chief of the Federal District\u2019s police. Mr. Moraes said the arrests were necessary to protect the investigation, preventing the suspects from destroying evidence or intimidating witnesses. Brazil\u2019s solicitor general also issued a request for Mr. Torres\u2019s arrest, while another top federal prosecutor requested to freeze his assets. That prosecutor also asked to freeze the assets of the Federal District\u2019s governor, Ibaneis Rocha, who has also been accused of allowing inadequate security during the protests. Hours after the riots concluded, Mr. Moraes suspended Mr. Rocha from his job as governor for at least 90 days.\n\nMr. Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who is also Brazil\u2019s elections chief, has become one of the nation\u2019s most powerful officials in recent years after his fellow justices expanded his authority to combat what they call an unusual threat to Brazil\u2019s democracy posed by Mr. Bolsonaro and his supporters. In the run up to last year\u2019s election, Mr. Moraes and fellow justices jailed several of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters without trial for threatening Brazilian officials or institutions, and Mr. Moraes has forced tech companies to suspend the accounts of dozens of prominent right-wing voices. Some on Brazil\u2019s right have criticized the aggressive response to the riots, saying Mr. Moraes and other officials are overstepping their authority. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, a former Army general who was Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vice president, criticized what he called \u201cindiscriminate detention\u201d of people suspected of taking part in the riots. The crackdown, he wrote on social media, \u201cshows that the new government, consistent with its Marxist-Leninist roots, acts in an amateurish, inhumane and illegal manner.\u201d By Tuesday, the police had arrested 727 people in connection with the riots and were still questioning hundreds of others, the federal police said in a statement. Some 599 people who were detained for questioning had been released from custody. Many rioters filmed themselves and others as they invaded the government buildings, giving authorities a body of evidence to build a case. Augusto de Arruda Botelho, Brazil\u2019s justice secretary, said the police had also collected DNA samples and fingerprints from the buildings.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFindings released in December revealed a number of issues throughout the league, including several instances of sexual and emotional abuse.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Soccer League on Monday permanently banned four former coaches, suspended other league officials, and fined several teams, following a report last month that detailed alleged abuse and misconduct across the league. Paul Riley, a former North Carolina Courage coach; Rory Dames, a former Chicago Red Stars coach; Richie Burke, a former Washington Spirit coach; and Christy Holly, a former Racing Louisville F.C. coach, were permanently banned from the league for alleged misconduct ranging from inappropriate comments to, in the case of Holly, groping a player. The Red Stars were fined $1.5 million, and Portland Thorns F.C. were fined $1 million for failure to properly act on allegations of misconduct. Craig Harrington, the former Utah Royals F.C. coach, and Alyse LaHue, the former general manager of Gotham F.C., each received two-year suspensions from the league. Harrington was found to have \u201cmade inappropriate sexual and objectifying comments,\u201d and LaHue was found to have sent players inappropriate messages, the N.W.S.L. report said.\n\nThe league said in a statement on Monday that the sweeping disciplinary actions were based on a 128-page report released in December. The report, a joint effort organized by the N.W.S.L. and its players\u2019 union, revealed a number of disturbing problems throughout the league, including instances of sexual abuse, unwanted sexual advances, emotional abuse, racist remarks, and retaliation against players who complained about how they were treated. \u201cPlayers from marginalized backgrounds, or with the least job security, were often targets of misconduct,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt the same time, these players faced the greatest barriers to speaking out about or obtaining redress for what they experienced.\u201d Jessica Berman, the league\u2019s commissioner, said in a statement that the \u201ccorrective action\u201d announced on Monday was \u201cappropriate and necessary.\u201d \u201cThe league will continue to prioritize implementing and enhancing the policies, programs and systems that put the health and safety of our players first,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThese changes will require leadership, accountability, funding and a willingness to embrace this new way of conducting business.\u201d Last month\u2019s report is similar to another released in October, from an investigation led by Sally Q. Yates, a former deputy attorney general, that detailed \u201csystemic\u201d verbal abuse and sexual misconduct by women\u2019s soccer coaches and found that officials in the United States Soccer Federation, the N.W.S.L. and throughout American soccer had failed to act over the years on complaints from players.\n\nHolly, while coaching Louisville, groped one of his players and sent her inappropriate text messages, according to the investigations. On one occasion, Holly invited a player to his home to watch video of a game, but instead masturbated in front of her and showed her pornography, the investigations found. The investigations also found that Riley, who was fired from the North Carolina Courage in 2021, used his position to try to coerce at least three players into sexual relationships. One player said Riley made sexual advances toward her on several occasions, according to the reports. Dames, who resigned from the Chicago Red Stars in 2021, was accused by the women\u2019s soccer star Christen Press of \u201cverbal and emotional abuse,\u201d the N.W.S.L. report said. The investigation led by Yates also found that he had created a \u201csexualized team environment\u201d at a Chicago youth club that \u201ccrossed the line to sexual relationships in multiple cases, though those relationships may have begun after the age of consent.\u201d The N.W.S.L. report said that several players credibly reported that Burke \u201cverbally and emotionally abused players,\u201d and \u201cused racial slurs, made racially insensitive and offensive jokes.\u201d Susan Bogart, a lawyer for Dames, said in a statement that the league had not informed Dames of the suspension. \u201cMr. Dames did not engage in conduct while serving as a coach in the N.W.S.L. that would warrant any disciplinary action let alone a permanent exclusion from the N.W.S.L.,\u201d Bogart said. Riley, Burke, Holly, Harrington and the Portland Thorns did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nKelly Hoffman, a lawyer for LaHue, said in an email on Monday night that \u201cMs. LaHue continues to deny the allegations made against her. Notwithstanding the issues presented in her case, she supports the N.W.S.L. in its efforts towards corrective action.\u201d A spokesman for the Chicago Red Stars said in an email on Monday night that the team was aware of the disciplinary action and that it was \u201cworking with the league in a cooperative manner to satisfy the fine.\u201d The investigations led by the N.W.S.L. and Yates highlighted reports in 2021 by The Athletic and The Washington Post that described accusations of sexual and verbal abuse against coaches in the women\u2019s league. Those reports led to public protests by players and the resignations or firings of league executives. Weeks after the reports of alleged sexual and verbal abuse, five coaches in the league were linked to the allegations. As part of Monday\u2019s disciplinary actions, four others teams \u2014 OL Reign, Gotham F.C., Racing Louisville F.C. and North Carolina Courage \u2014 were fined amounts ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 for failure to act on allegations of misconduct. Six other league officials were told that any future employment with the league would depend on taking part in a training, \u201cacknowledging wrongdoing and accepting personal responsibility for inappropriate conduct\u201d and \u201cdemonstrating a sincere commitment to correcting behavior.\u201d Two of the six officials were Vera Pauw, a former coach of the Houston Dash, and Farid Benstiti, a former coach of the OL Reign. The N.W.S.L. report said Pauw and Benstiti \u201cshamed players for their weight.\u201d In a statement after the N.W.S.L. report was released in December, Pauw said she wanted to \u201crefute every allegation\u201d made against her in the report. Benstiti could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday night.",

I felt strange watching guys in their late teens and early 20s, many of them Black, play in a packed stadium at the flagship university of the only state to secede twice \u2014 once from Mexico, and then again from the Union \u2014 so that it could keep enslaving Black people. All the while, the university sold the games as part of a storied tradition but ignored shameful details, like the fact that Texas had one of the last major college-football programs to integrate, or that its most celebrated coach, Darrell K. Royal, objected to integrating the team in 1959.\n\nHow could I reconcile my discomfort with my love of the game? Enter hype videos: do-it-yourself compilations of divinely timed stiff arms, the most beautiful jukes you\u2019ve ever seen, otherworldly one-handed backward-diving catches and other athletic feats.\n\nSome colleges make their own official hype reels, along with abridged versions for TikTok and Instagram, to promote football programs to fans and recruits. Some of these are very good, but on the whole they are a little dishonest \u2014 it feels as if I\u2019m being lied to when I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram and come across offensive highlights for Iowa football, a program notorious for its perennially bad offense. These videos are also aesthetically predictable, usually starting with solemn shots of a stadium meant to convey a program\u2019s achievements. More than anything, these videos are propaganda controlled by administrators and communication strategists, meant to burnish teams\u2019 brands of administrators and communication strategists. They\u2019re not necessarily bad, but they have little to do with the players\u2019 experiences.",

Trump was acting in his official capacity as president when he made disparaging comments about a writer who had accused him of rape.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A District of Columbia court wrestled on Tuesday over whether Donald J. Trump was acting within his capacity as president when he made disparaging comments about a writer who had accused him of rape more than two decades ago. The arguments, made over more than two and a half hours before nine judges, largely focused on technical legal issues related to when, under District of Columbia law, a person should be interpreted as acting as an employee of an organization \u2014 in this case, the federal government \u2014 rather than a private individual. How the court rules will likely determine the future, if any, of the case brought by the writer, E. Jean Carroll, who has sued Mr. Trump for defamation. Any decision could also have broader consequences for other government officials because a federal law essentially protects them from being sued for actions within the scope of their jobs. No decision is expected for several weeks, and it was unclear from the arguments how the court was leaning.\n\nA federal appeals court in New York had asked the District of Columbia Court of Appeals \u2014 a local court akin to a state\u2019s supreme court \u2014 to clarify how its law on employer liability applied to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. But several judges expressed concern about how they could do so without a more detailed factual record that would illuminate Mr. Trump\u2019s motivation when he discussed Ms. Carroll in a derogatory way. What to Know About E. Jean Carroll\u2019s Accusations Two lawsuits. E. Jean Carroll, a writer who says former President Donald J. Trump raped her in the mid 1990s, has filed two separate lawsuits against the former president. Here\u2019s what to know: Who is E. Jean Carroll and what does she claim? Ms. Carroll is a journalist and a onetime advice columnist for Elle magazine. She wrote about the alleged assault in a 2019 memoir, claiming that Mr. Trump had attacked her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. The account was the most serious of several sexual misconduct allegations women have made against Mr. Trump, all of which he has denied. How did Trump respond to her claims? After Ms. Carroll\u2019s account appeared as an excerpt of her book in New York magazine, Mr. Trump emphatically denied her accusations, saying that she was \u201ctotally lying,\u201d that the assault had never occurred and that he could not have raped her because she was not his \u201ctype.\u201d On what grounds is Ms. Carroll suing Mr. Trump for rape? In May, New York passed a law giving adult sexual assault victims a one-time opportunity to file civil cases, even if the statute of limitations has long expired. Ms. Carroll subsequently filed a lawsuit, accusing Mr. Trump of rape and seeking damages. Why did she also sue him for defamation? In 2019, Ms. Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump in New York for making disparaging comments and branding her a liar after the publication of her memoir. On Oct. 19, the former president was questioned under oath in the case. Judge Catharine Friend Easterly noted that in employer liability cases, there is typically a jury verdict and trial record before the court. In this instance, there is only a complaint by Ms. Carroll. Judge John P. Howard also asked whether the matter warranted more detailed fact-finding. But lawyers for the Justice Department and for Mr. Trump argued that what is in the public record now \u2014 that Mr. Trump was the president at the time and that his comments were in response to reporters\u2019 questions \u2014 was sufficient to say that he was acting as a government employee. But a lawyer for Ms. Carroll, Joshua Matz, argued that the court should rule that Mr. Trump was acting outside the scope of his employment \u201cin defaming Ms. Carroll because he did so for personal reasons rather than to further the interests of the United States.\u201d Several judges also voiced concern that the oddities of the case could distort the District of Columbia\u2019s law, which seeks to hold ordinary employers responsible when their employees cause people harm as part of their job but not when they are acting on their own.\n\nThe defamation lawsuit traces back to 2019, when Ms. Carroll published a memoir accusing Mr. Trump of assaulting her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s. Mr. Trump called her a liar and said she was \u201cnot my type.\u201d She then sued him for defamation. A year later, the Justice Department took over Mr. Trump\u2019s defense, invoking the Westfall Act, which allows the federal government to step in as the defendant in lawsuits against federal officials. If a court approves such a substitution, the lawsuits must then be dismissed as a matter of sovereign immunity. Since then, the legal case has been consumed by a fight over whether the Justice Department\u2019s intervention was justified. Lawyers for Ms. Carroll have contended that Mr. Trump was acting as a private citizen. Lawyers for Mr. Trump have argued that he spoke to the news media while in office, so he was acting in his capacity as president. In October 2020, a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan, Lewis A. Kaplan, rejected the Justice Department\u2019s intervention, ruling that Mr. Trump had talked about Ms. Carroll as a private citizen and so could be sued for defamation. But in September 2022, an appeals court in New York called that ruling into question. By a 2-to-1 vote, a three-judge panel asked the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to first determine whether, under D.C. law and precedents, Mr. Trump was acting as president when he made his comments about Ms. Carroll. While the ruling could determine the future of Ms. Carroll\u2019s defamation case, it will not be the final word on what has become a protracted legal battle between her and Mr. Trump. In November, the state of New York changed a law to allow lawsuits over claims of sexual assaults that took place more than 20 years earlier. Ms. Carroll immediately filed a separate lawsuit accusing Mr. Trump of rape and seeking damages.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nPublic safety and dealing with mentally ill people are among the topics the governor is expected to address today.\n\nWhat to Listen For in Hochul\u2019s State of the State Speech\n\nWhat will the governor say? No matter who is governor, that\u2019s always the question in Albany on the day of the State of the State address. That day is today. Some longtime Albany watchers say there is a formula to State of the State speeches, even for governors like Hochul, who have been in office for a relatively short time. It\u2019s been 504 days since she succeeded Andrew Cuomo. That\u2019s a fraction of the 7,500-plus days that the state\u2019s longest-serving governor, George Clinton, put in between 1777 and 1804, with a six-year timeout from 1795 to 1801. But enough history.\n\nLongtime Albany watchers say the State of the State usually follows a time-tested formula. Most years, said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, \u201ca lot of the speech is largely self-congratulatory for the governor and the lawmakers. There\u2019s usually a portion that has interesting regional implications as a way to get The Buffalo News to write about something in Buffalo or The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle to write about something in Rochester.\u201d Also, he said, the speeches are \u201cusually short on details and the bad news doesn\u2019t show up until the budget\u201d \u2014 which will follow in a few weeks. \u201cThe M.T.A.\u2019s cratering finances, there probably won\u2019t be much mentioned about that,\u201d he said, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the subways and buses in New York City as well as the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad. Hochul indicated in her inauguration speech on New Year\u2019s Day that public safety and housing affordability would be her top two issues as she tries to address the wave of discontent that carried her Republican challenger, Lee Zeldin, to within 6\u00bd percentage points of defeating her in November. Democrats in Albany \u2014 who hold veto-proof supermajorities in the Assembly and the State Senate \u2014 will listen for hints that Hochul, a moderate, is open to policy concessions to progressives. It remains to be seen whether she will seek changes to the state\u2019s bail laws, which progressives might oppose. Another question is whether she will mention the fight over her nomination of Hector LaSalle to be the state\u2019s chief judge. At least a dozen state senators have already said they would vote against his confirmation.\n\nPart of her address will focus on an ambitious billion-dollar plan to close some of the many gaps in the health care system for New Yorkers with mental illness. She is expected to call for drastic changes, including compelling private hospitals to reopen more than 800 inpatient psychiatric beds; creating 3,500 units of housing with service supports; and expanding mental health services in schools, which have seen steep increases in children with psychological problems. Her plan would also expand insurance coverage for mental health services, including treatment for school-age children. She will also call for hospitals to follow stricter standards for evaluating and admitting patients with serious mental illness. And her plan would create more teams of outpatient care coordinators so those patients don\u2019t fall through the cracks. To help people with moderate mental illnesses like depression \u2014 who may have trouble accessing care \u2014 she will seek to triple the capacity of community behavioral centers that provide walk-in services, to 188,000 patients, from 68,000. Some 19 new sites would be set up in New York and 11 more in other parts of the state. Hochul\u2019s coordinated approach is \u201cthe best prescription a doctor can write,\u201d said Jody Rudin, the chief executive of the Institute for Community Living, a nonprofit that provides services and housing to people with serious mental illnesses. She called Hochul\u2019s plan \u201ctransformational.\u201d Several elements of the governor\u2019s plan are among the items that Mayor Eric Adams asked for in November when he announced his own policy to help people with severe, untreated mental illness, by force if necessary. Adams said he wanted the state to require hospitals to consider patients\u2019 long-term history and their ability to adhere to outpatient treatment when deciding how long to hold them. He also called for better coordination between hospitals and community caregivers.\n\nNurses at eight other private city hospitals had reached deals on tentative contracts and did not walk out. Some nurses on the picket line at Mount Sinai \u2014 who saw how valued they were when the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020 and who struggled with exhaustion and burnout \u2014 said they wanted better conditions for themselves and their patients. Lorena Vivas, a nurse at Mount Sinai for 19 years, said she had often been assigned to care for three or four patients at a time in intensive care, instead of the one or two she is supposed to look after. \u201cThis has been going on even before the pandemic,\u201d she added, \u201cand the pandemic just blew the whole thing open.\u201d Picketing Montefiore nurses described overcrowded, understaffed conditions. The union said patients at Montefiore are kept in hallways so often that management has installed televisions there. Hospital officials have said they are doing what they can, given the national nursing shortage. A spokeswoman for Mount Sinai said the hospital had pursued \u201cunprecedented recruitment strategies\u201d in recent years. As it became clear this week that a strike was likely, Mount Sinai and Montefiore rushed to bring in temporary staff, even pressing doctors into service to fill nursing gaps. Montefiore said in a statement on Monday that union leaders had \u201cdecided to walk away from the bedsides of their patients\u201d despite an offer of a 19.1 percent compounded wage increase over three years and a promise to create more than 170 new nursing positions.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIn a State of the State address, the governor will seek to create new beds for people with severe mental illness and offer more mental health care to children.\n\nALBANY, N.Y. \u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul will unveil a far-reaching billion-dollar plan on Tuesday to close some of the many gaps in the care system for New Yorkers with mental illness. Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, is pledging to drastically change the state\u2019s approach to mental health in the wake of the pandemic and its effects on public safety and children\u2019s behavior and school performance. The governor\u2019s plan would compel state-licensed hospitals to reopen more than 800 inpatient psychiatric beds that disappeared during the pandemic, create 3,500 units of housing with supportive services and expand mental health services in schools, which have seen steep increases in children with psychological problems. The plan takes particular aim at helping the hundreds or perhaps thousands of people with serious mental illness who cycle in and out of hospitals, jails, shelters and streets. Hospitals often discharge them after only a few days without coordinating with caregivers on the outside.\n\nThe state will require hospitals to follow stricter standards for evaluating and admitting patients, and it will create dozens more teams of outpatient care coordinators so hospitals can hand those patients off and ensure continuity of care. \u201cWe have underinvested in mental health care for so long, and allowed the situation to become so dire, that it has become a public safety crisis as well,\u201d said Ms. Hochul. \u201cThis proposal marks a monumental shift to make sure no one falls through the cracks and to finally and fully meet the mental health needs of all New Yorkers.\u201d Ms. Hochul will make the announcement during her State of the State address in Albany on Tuesday afternoon, her first since being elected to a full four-year term in November. The governor\u2019s agenda is expected to focus heavily on improving public safety, as well as tackling housing affordability by expanding home construction statewide \u2014 pressing issues that defined her election. Several elements of the governor\u2019s mental health plan were requested by Mayor Eric Adams of New York City in November when he announced his own policy to help people with severe, untreated mental illness, by force if necessary. Mr. Adams had asked the state to require hospitals to consider patients\u2019 long-term history and ability to adhere to outpatient treatment when deciding how long to hold them, and to improve coordination between hospitals and community caregivers. The Adams administration greeted Ms. Hochul\u2019s plan warmly. \u201cWe applaud this bold slate of proposals and look forward to continue building on our progress and tackling these issues in partnership with the governor in the months ahead,\u201d Kate Smart, a spokeswoman for Mr. Adams, said in a statement.\n\nOne of the most consequential components of Ms. Hochul\u2019s plan seeks to reverse the dire shortage of hospital beds available to treat people with the most acute cases of mental illness. Since 2014, the number of inpatient psychiatric hospital beds, which are expensive to operate, has fallen by about 20 percent in New York \u2014 in private hospitals and state institutions alike, in New York City and statewide. There were about 6,200 psychiatric beds in community-based hospitals licensed by the state in 2014; in 2022 there were about 5,000, a drop of about 1,200. The reduction has led to a clogged system without enough beds for all those seeking care, which means strained emergency rooms still coping with a pandemic must often take them in. Ms. Hochul is planning to order hospitals to reopen 850 beds that have remained offline in part because state officials say it is more profitable for hospitals to redirect resources elsewhere. The governor will also pursue legislation to increase the state\u2019s ability to fine hospitals that don\u2019t comply with the order to $2,000 per violation, per day. Micah Lasher, the governor\u2019s policy director, said the proposals \u201caimed to address the economics of the issue for hospitals\u201d after the state failed to cajole hospitals to open the beds through other incentives last year. Additionally, the state plans to build 150 new psychiatric beds in state-run hospitals, 100 of which will be in New York City, a significant increase to treat vulnerable patients who sometimes require months of care before being released. (The new beds are in addition to 50 beds Ms. Hochul had already announced last year.) The president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, Kenneth E. Raske, said hospitals \u201cshare the governor\u2019s goal of expanding the number of available inpatient psych beds.\u201d\n\nFor years, operators of shelters for the mentally ill and advocates for the homeless have complained that overwhelmed hospitals provide only the bare minimum of help for people with profound mental illness and fail to connect those patients to the tools they need to function outside a hospital setting. One such patient, Martial Simon, a homeless man with schizophrenia who had been hospitalized at least 20 times, pushed a woman in front of a train last year. To address this problem, Ms. Hochul\u2019s plan would fund the creation of nearly 100 teams of clinicians and counselors who would deliver \u201cwraparound\u201d outpatient services to more than 5,000 people with serious mental illness statewide, about half of them in New York City. Such teams already exist, but they are in short supply, and many programs have waiting lists. \u201cThey help them if they need housing, they help them if they need groceries and they give them mental health treatment,\u201d Ann Marie T. Sullivan, the commissioner of the State Office of Mental Health, said in an interview on Monday. The state will require hospitals to coordinate carefully with the outpatient teams and require hospitals to follow checklists when they discharge patients, under threat of losing their licenses, Dr. Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be pretty specific,\u201d she said: \u201c\u2018Did you contact the provider who was working with this client? Did you talk to his mother?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile much of the recent focus has been on the mental health crisis playing out in New York City\u2019s streets, Hochul officials pitched their plan as a comprehensive statewide effort to shore up years of underinvestment in a frayed system plagued with shortcomings at every step of the way. For example, the state is seeking to help vulnerable youth by increasing the number of school-based clinics. The move is meant to address the dearth of mental health programs for schoolchildren, whose struggles with problems like anxiety and severe depression were exacerbated by pandemic school closures. To target people with more moderate mental illnesses \u2014 such as depression \u2014 who may have trouble accessing care, the state is seeking to triple the capacity of community behavioral centers, which provide walk-in services, from 13 to 39. Hochul officials estimated that their plan, parts of which would need to be approved by the Democrat-controlled State Legislature, would cost at least $1 billion. Most of the funding, about $900 million over five years, would be spent on building more residential housing for people with mental illnesses; the rest would be spent in recurring operating expenses of at least $130 million a year, the officials said. Jody Rudin, C.E.O. of the Institute for Community Living, a nonprofit that provides services and housing to people with serious mental illness in New York City, praised Ms. Hochul\u2019s coordinated approach, calling it \u201cthe best prescription a doctor can write.\u201d \u201cThis is a transformational plan that has the power to move us from a fragmented system to a comprehensive one by building on community-based, trauma-informed programs that help people get better,\u201d Ms. Rudin said. But Cal Hedigan, the C.E.O. of Community Access, a nonprofit provider of housing and mental health services, said in a statement that while she applauded Ms. Hochul\u2019s investments in outpatient help, she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the fact that most of the housing in the governor\u2019s plan \u2014 which includes 500 single-room occupancy units and 900 units of medium-stay housing \u2014 is temporary or transitional. \u201cWe know, empirically, that what\u2019s needed and most effective is permanent, supportive housing,\u201d she said.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTwo Democrats filed an official complaint about Mr. Santos\u2019s financial disclosures with the House\u2019s bipartisan ethics committee.\n\nRepresentatives Daniel Goldman and Ritchie Torres, both Democrats of New York, filed an official complaint on Tuesday asking the House Committee on Ethics to investigate Representative George Santos, the Republican who admitted to lying about his background after a report last month in The New York Times. The congressmen requested that the House committee explore whether Mr. Santos, a first-year lawmaker representing parts of Long Island and Queens, broke the law when he filed his required financial disclosures late and without key details about his finances. \u201cCongressman Torres and I feel it\u2019s incredibly important to make sure that the integrity of the House and the integrity of its members are put front, first and foremost,\u201d said Mr. Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who represents parts of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The complaint by Mr. Goldman and Mr. Torres, made just days after Mr. Santos took his oath of office, adds significant pressure to a novice lawmaker already surrounded by controversy and facing calls to resign.\n\nIn his disclosure, Mr. Santos reported that his company, the Devolder Organization, paid him a $750,000 salary and provided dividends totaling somewhere from $1 million to $5 million. But he did not offer details about his company\u2019s clients who might have helped him earn such a large sum, an apparent violation of a requirement to disclose any compensation in excess of $5,000 from a single source. Mr. Santos, the son of Brazilian immigrants, also reported owning an apartment in Rio de Janeiro valued at as much as $1 million. But he told The New York Post last month that he did not own any properties, and he has not provided more details about the property in Brazil. Mr. Goldman and Mr. Torres said that they wanted the House Committee on Ethics to investigate whether Mr. Santos\u2019s filing had violated the Ethics in Government Act \u2014 an anti-corruption law passed after the Watergate scandal of the 1970s \u2014 because it was not \u201ctimely, accurate and complete.\u201d On Tuesday morning, the two congressmen delivered a copy of their complaint to Mr. Santos\u2019s office in Washington. Standing outside Mr. Santos\u2019s door, Mr. Goldman and Mr. Torres said they decided to take action in part because of the relative silence of the congressional Republican leadership. Speaker Kevin McCarthy has largely been silent since details about Mr. Santos\u2019s fabrications emerged last month. On Tuesday, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican majority leader, said party leadership would handle questions about Mr. Santos\u2019s role in Congress internally. \u201cObviously, there were concerns about what we had heard, and so we\u2019re going to have to sit down and talk to him about it,\u201d Mr. Scalise said at a news conference. Mr. Santos told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that he had \u201cdone nothing unethical.\u201d Mr. Goldman and Mr. Torres are not the only lawmakers to push for a House ethics investigation. Last month, Representative Nick LaLota, who, like Mr. Santos, is a first-term Republican representing Long Island, called for a \u201cfull investigation by the House ethics committee and, if necessary, law enforcement\u201d into Mr. Santos\u2019s behavior.\n\nThe ethics committee, a bipartisan panel of lawmakers that enforces the chamber\u2019s internal rules, is not known for doling out significant punishments. Congress rarely takes serious disciplinary action against fellow members, unless their behavior rises to the level of a federal crime. Government watchdog groups often criticize the body for being too slow-moving. Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit group, said the committee \u201cwould rather have people resign or have their terms finish out\u201d than have to punish sitting lawmakers. But Mr. Libowitz said that the complaint by Mr. Torres and Mr. Goldman could pressure the committee to begin an investigation, especially in light of rules changes pushed by House Republicans to the bipartisan Office of Congressional Ethics that could hamper its power. On Monday night, Mr. Goldman said that the changes would \u201cgut\u201d the office, which typically conducts inquiries and then refers both reports and recommendations to the ethics committee for consideration. In a statement, he said the changes were being made \u201cjust in time to protect their favorite fraud, George Santos.\u201d In an interview with Insider, Mr. Santos said that he approved of the changes, calling the new House rules package \u201cfantastic.\u201d The complaint by Mr. Goldman and Mr. Torres will effectively leapfrog the office, spurring the ethics committee to take action on its own. The committee is equally split between Democrats and Republicans, which Mr. Libowitz said can limit the impact that partisan politics can have on its work. If the House committee chooses to begin an investigation and finds that Mr. Santos is guilty, it has a range of disciplinary options.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIf Vladimir Putin thought he could freeze out Ukraine\u2019s allies by cutting off the cheap Russian gas that Europeans have used to heat their homes, Mother Nature seems to have had other plans. The first half of this winter has been exceptionally warm across much of the continent. That has reduced the demand for gas for home heating and kept reserves in surprisingly good shape. It helps that Europe has the money to buy gas elsewhere. And Europeans have helped themselves by tightening their energy belts. More on that later. First, consider the wild weather. The beginning of the new year was exceptionally warm. Jan. 1 was warmer than any January day since daily temperature records began in 1940, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a group of climate researchers supported by the European Union.\n\nThat fits a distinct warming trend: 2022 was Europe\u2019s second-hottest year on record, after 2020, Copernicus announced on Tuesday. The summer of 2022 was Europe\u2019s hottest ever. Fall was Europe\u2019s third-hottest. Winters are steadily getting milder too, especially in the colder, more northerly parts of Europe, which are warming more in winter than in summer, Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist at Copernicus, said in an email. Milder winters, especially in very cold climates, mean lower heating demand. The fingerprints of climate change are unmistakable. The last eight years have been the eight hottest years on record. Climate change is risky for Russia too, by the way. It is warming faster than the global average. That\u2019s melting permafrost in some areas and \u2014 wait for this \u2014 threatening some of its oil and gas infrastructure. This warm winter has outsized geopolitical implications. Russia supplied 40 percent of Europe\u2019s gas before the invasion.\n\nNatural gas, more accurately described as methane gas or fossil gas, has long been a potent weapon for Russia. It\u2019s a less potent weapon now because Europe\u2019s demand for heat has been lower. At least for the time being. Gas prices had soared in the months immediately after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Russia cut off most of its supply to the 27 countries of the European Union. Adding to the crisis, France shut down many of its aging nuclear reactors for maintenance. Still, by the end of the year, the European Union\u2019s gas storage capacity was at more than 83 percent. The wholesale price of gas had fallen to pre-invasion levels, though it was still higher than in years before. \u201cEurope has ended 2022 in a much better position than many feared only a few months ago,\u201d said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas research at Wood Mackenzie, a private firm that analyzes natural resources trends. Gas demand fell by 10 percent in 2022. Household consumption declined. Industrial consumption, too. Sales of heat pumps, which run on electricity, not gas, have risen sharply. And Europeans accelerated the transition to renewables. The bloc was set to add 300 gigawatts of solar energy by 2026. That, too, can potentially blunt the leverage that the Kremlin can have over Europe, by reducing reliance on gas. It helps that Europe is rich. Europe still needs a lot of gas for heat and electricity, and it bought a lot of gas from countries other than Russia at exceptionally high prices. That helped to drive the global price of gas out of reach for many other countries.\n\n\u201cWhat Europe has done is outprice everyone,\u201d said Lisa Fischer, an analyst at E3G, a climate and energy research group based in London. War enriched gas suppliers from everywhere other than Russia. Gas-producing companies, including those based in the United States, the largest gas exporter in the world, made a killing from high gas prices. It\u2019s still painful for many ordinary Europeans, though. Because Europe bought gas at such high prices, consumers are still paying through the nose. Many European cities are darker. Poor households are feeling the greatest hardship. Next winter, there may be more discontent. There are two uncertainties. First, China. As the country emerges from Covid lockdowns, its demand for gas may go up significantly, raising the competition for Europe. Second, the weather. The one certainty in the era of climate change is that we are in an age of extreme weather. Or, as the International Energy Agency put it in a recent report that urged Europeans to accelerate energy efficiency and the deployment of renewables, \u201cThere is no guarantee that temperatures will be as forgiving for the remainder of the winter, or for 2023 as a whole.\u201d\n\nOzone recovery back on track: Researchers say a crackdown in China seems to have eliminated rogue emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals. U.S. carbon emissions grew in 2022: Emissions from energy and industry continued to rebound from an abrupt pandemic decline, even as renewables surpassed coal. French food giant sued: Danone, the French dairy company, is being taken to court by three environmental groups that say it has failed to sufficiently reduce its plastic footprint. Wild weather hits California\u2019s trees: Stressed by drought, whipped by wind and weakened at the roots by flooding, trees have toppled across the state in breathtaking numbers. Africa\u2019s first heat officer: Eugenia Kargbo remembers when Sierra Leone\u2019s capital was greener and cooler, and is now trying to help the city combat rising temperatures. Bad news for parasites: Populations are declining sharply, and climate change could be part of the problem.\n\nBefore you go: Why do we keep widening highways? It seems to make sense: If there\u2019s highway congestion, just make the roads bigger. But research shows that, after a highway is widened, traffic, and the greenhouse gas emissions that come with it, generally increases. Now, some communities and government officials are pushing back on widening plans. Thanks for being a subscriber. We\u2019ll be back on Friday.

            "content": "\u201cA small number\u201d of classified documents were discovered in President Biden\u2019s former office at a Washington think tank, the White House said.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe White House said it was cooperating as the Justice Department scrutinizes the matter.\n\nFollow for the latest on the discovery of the second batch of classified documents from Biden\u2019s vice presidency. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden\u2019s lawyers discovered \u201ca small number\u201d of classified documents in his former office at a Washington think tank last fall, the White House said on Monday, prompting the Justice Department to scrutinize the situation to determine how to proceed. The inquiry, according to two people familiar with the matter, is a type aimed at helping Attorney General Merrick B. Garland decide whether to appoint a special counsel, like the one investigating former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s hoarding of sensitive documents and failure to return all of them. The documents found in Mr. Biden\u2019s former office, which date to his time as vice president, were found by his personal lawyers on Nov. 2, when they were packing files at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, according to the White House. Officials did not describe precisely how many documents were involved, what kind of information they included or their level of classification.\n\nThe White House statement said that it \u201cis cooperating\u201d with the department but did not explain why Mr. Biden\u2019s team waited more than two months to announce the discovery of the documents, which came a week before the midterm congressional elections when the news would have been an explosive last-minute development. It also came shortly before Mr. Garland\u2019s Nov. 18 appointment of Jack Smith as a special counsel to take over the criminal investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to return a large number of classified documents that were sent to his Florida residence and club, Mar-a-Lago, when he left office \u2014 even after being subpoenaed. At the time, Mr. Garland cited the fact that Mr. Trump had just announced he was running for president again, and that Mr. Biden had indicated that he is likely to run as well, as justification to transfer control of the investigation to Mr. Smith. (An attorney general retains final say over whether anyone is charged with a crime by a special counsel.) Mr. Trump jumped on Monday\u2019s disclosure. \u201cWhen is the FBI going to raid the many houses of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?\u201d he wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. \u201cThese documents were definitely not declassified.\u201d What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What\u2019s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. That appeared to refer to Mr. Trump\u2019s disputed claim that before leaving office he declassified all the documents the F.B.I. found when it searched Mar-a-Lago in August. No credible evidence has emerged to support that claim, and his lawyers have resisted repeating it in court, where there are professional consequences for lying. In any case, the potential charges the F.B.I. cited in its search warrant affidavit do not depend on whether intentionally mishandled documents were classified. But while Mr. Trump tried to suggest a parallel, the circumstances of the Biden discovery as described appeared to be significantly different. Mr. Biden had neither been notified that he had official records nor been asked to return them, the White House said, and his team promptly revealed the discovery to the archives and returned them within a day. \u201cThe documents were not the subject of any previous request or inquiry by the archives,\u201d Richard A. Sauber, a special White House counsel, wrote in the statement. \u201cSince that discovery, the president\u2019s personal attorneys have cooperated with the archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden administration documents are appropriately in the possession of the archives.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, in 2021 the archives repeatedly asked Mr. Trump to turn over large numbers of documents it had determined were missing. He put the agency off for months, then allowed it to retrieve 15 boxes of material in early 2022, including scores of classified documents, but it was later discovered that he kept more. Eventually, the Justice Department obtained a grand jury subpoena for documents with classification markings remaining in Mr. Trump\u2019s possession, and a lawyer for Mr. Trump turned over several more and told the department there were none left. But an August search by the F.B.I. found 103 more marked as classified \u2014 along with thousands of other official records. The search warrant affidavit that the Justice Department submitted suggested that Mr. Trump was under investigation for obstruction, along with possible violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the willful unauthorized retention of national security documents and failure \u201cto deliver them on demand\u201d to a government official entitled to take custody of them. Still, whatever the legal questions, as a matter of political reality, the discovery will make the perception of the Justice Department potentially charging Mr. Trump over his handling of the documents more challenging. As a special counsel, Mr. Smith is handling that investigation, along with one into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and the Jan. 6 attack on Congress, under Mr. Garland\u2019s supervision. Moreover, the discovery will fuel the fires on Capitol Hill, where Republicans who have just taken the House majority were already planning multiple investigations of the Biden administration, including the decision to have the F.B.I. search Mar-a-Lago. Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is in line to become the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on Monday that he would investigate the discovery of the classified documents in Mr. Biden\u2019s office, vowing to send letters demanding information within 48 hours. \u201cHow ironic,\u201d Mr. Comer said in an interview. \u201cNow we learn that Joe Biden had documents that are considered classified. I wonder, is the National Archives going to trigger a raid of the White House tonight? Or of the Biden Center?\u201d He added, \u201cSo now we\u2019re going to take that information that we requested on the Mar-a-Lago raid, and we\u2019re going to expand it to include the documents that Joe Biden has.\u201d\n\nThe top Democrat on the committee, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, downplayed the matter, saying that he had confidence that Mr. Garland had taken appropriate steps to review the circumstances and that Mr. Biden\u2019s lawyers \u201cappear to have taken immediate and proper action\u201d to notify the archives of the documents. The department\u2019s leadership decided to make the unusual choice of assigning the case outside the jurisdictions involved because Mr. Lausch was a Republican appointee and his work would likelier be seen as impartial, according to a person familiar with the situation. Mr. Biden had kept Mr. Lausch in office at the request of the two Democratic senators from Illinois, Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, because he was investigating Michael J. Madigan, the former speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, during the presidential transition in 2021. In March, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Madigan, a Democrat, on 22 counts of racketeering and corruption charges. A former top prosecutor appointed during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration said the attorney general should turn the Biden matter over to a special counsel, just as he did the Trump investigation. \u201cThe circumstances of Biden\u2019s possession of classified documents appear different than Trump\u2019s, but Merrick Garland must appoint a special counsel to investigate,\u201d said John P. Fishwick Jr., who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. \u201cMerrick Garland waited too long to let us know he had opened this investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cTo keep the confidence of the country, you need to be transparent and timely.\u201d A department spokesman had no comment on the matter, and would not say whether the national security division, which has spearheaded the investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s retention of documents at his Florida residence and resort, was also involved. With Mr. Lausch investigating the handling of classified information in Mr. Biden\u2019s office, and David Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, investigating the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, both Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys who have remained at the department are now scrutinizing the Biden family.",

Ninguno particip\u00f3 en las manifestaciones que han consumido a Per\u00fa durante un mes. Pero todos murieron el lunes en el sur del pa\u00eds, v\u00edctimas de lo que se convirti\u00f3 en el d\u00eda m\u00e1s mort\u00edfero de enfrentamientos entre manifestantes y fuerzas gubernamentales desde que el pa\u00eds estall\u00f3 en violencia el mes pasado. En cuesti\u00f3n de horas, al menos 17 civiles y un polic\u00eda fallecieron en el caos de las manifestaciones, seg\u00fan la Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo del pa\u00eds, una oleada de violencia extraordinaria que complic\u00f3 el intento de la nueva presidenta de estabilizar el pa\u00eds.\n\nLas muertes, en la ciudad de Juliaca, cerca de la frontera con Bolivia, provocaron un repudio generalizado hacia las fuerzas de seguridad peruanas, que parecen ser responsables de la mayor\u00eda de los fallecimientos, y han sido acusadas por manifestantes y grupos de derechos humanos de usar la fuerza letal de forma indiscriminada contra civiles. \u201c\u00c9l estaba con la ropa uniformada, como todos los m\u00e9dicos, para que sean reconocidos y no los ataquen\u201d, dijo Milagros Samillan, de 27 a\u00f1os, hermana del residente m\u00e9dico muerto, un aspirante a neurocirujano llamado Marco Samillan, de 31 a\u00f1os. \u201cPero aun as\u00ed la polic\u00eda los ha atacado a matar\u201d.\n\nEl martes, Jennie Dador, secretaria ejecutiva de la Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos de Per\u00fa, un grupo de rendici\u00f3n de cuentas, responsabiliz\u00f3 de las muertes del lunes al \u201cuso indiscriminado de la fuerza\u201d por parte de las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado. \u201cLo que ocurri\u00f3 ayer realmente fue una masacre\u201d, coment\u00f3. \u201cFueron asesinatos extrajudiciales\u201d. Per\u00fa, el quinto pa\u00eds m\u00e1s poblado de Am\u00e9rica Latina, ha sido escenario de manifestaciones violentas desde mediados de diciembre, cuando el entonces presidente de izquierda del pa\u00eds, Pedro Castillo, quien hab\u00eda prometido atender los viejos problemas de la pobreza y la desigualdad, intent\u00f3 disolver el Congreso y gobernar por decreto. La medida fue condenada de manera generalizada como una acci\u00f3n inconstitucional, Castillo fue detenido y su vicepresidenta fue juramentada en su lugar.\n\nLos partidarios de Castillo, muchos de ellos provenientes de regiones rurales desfavorecidas, r\u00e1pidamente tomaron las calles para pedir nuevas elecciones generales y varios de ellos afirmaron que se les hab\u00eda arrebatado el derecho a ser gobernados por el hombre que hab\u00edan elegido para el cargo solamente un a\u00f1o antes. La violencia del lunes en la ciudad de Juliaca, al sur del pa\u00eds, marc\u00f3 el enfrentamiento m\u00e1s mort\u00edfero entre civiles y actores armados en Per\u00fa en al menos dos d\u00e9cadas, cuando el pa\u00eds sali\u00f3 de una dictadura y de una lucha prolongada y brutal contra una guerrilla violenta, un conflicto que dej\u00f3 al menos 70.000 personas muertas, muchas de ellas civiles. Las convulsiones violentas en Per\u00fa se producen en un momento en el que Sudam\u00e9rica enfrenta amenazas importantes en muchas de sus democracias , y cuando las encuestas muestran niveles excepcionalmente bajos de confianza en las instituciones gubernamentales, los pol\u00edticos y los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n. El domingo, simpatizantes de Jair Bolsonaro, el expresidente de extrema derecha de Brasil, asaltaron el Congreso y otros edificios de la capital, impulsados por la creencia de que las elecciones que Bolsonaro perdi\u00f3 en octubre hab\u00edan estado ama\u00f1adas. En la vecina Bolivia, estallaron protestas en Santa Cruz, centro econ\u00f3mico del pa\u00eds, tras la detenci\u00f3n del gobernador de la oposici\u00f3n, cuyos partidarios afirman que est\u00e1 siendo perseguido por el gobierno en el poder. El ministro del Interior de Per\u00fa, V\u00edctor Rojas, dijo que las protestas en Juliaca hab\u00edan comenzado de manera pac\u00edfica pero que se volvieron violentas alrededor de las 3 p. m., cuando unos 9000 manifestantes intentaron tomar el control del aeropuerto y personas con armas improvisadas y explosivos atacaron a la polic\u00eda.\n\nRojas asegur\u00f3 que las fuerzas de seguridad hab\u00edan actuado dentro de los l\u00edmites legales para defenderse. Fue \u201cimposible controlar a la turba\u201d, dijo. Los enfrentamientos en Juliaca elevan el n\u00famero de fallecidos a nivel nacional desde la destituci\u00f3n de Castillo a al menos 47 personas, seg\u00fan la Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo de Per\u00fa. Casi todos los muertos han sido civiles, asegur\u00f3 el organismo: 39 personas que murieron en medio de las protestas, junto a un oficial de polic\u00eda y siete que fallecieron en accidentes de tr\u00e1nsito relacionados con el caos o como resultado de los bloqueos de los manifestantes. Las manifestaciones comenzaron en el pa\u00eds poco despu\u00e9s de que, el 7 de diciembre, las autoridades detuvieran a Castillo por cargos de rebeli\u00f3n. Algunas protestas en el \u00faltimo mes han sido pac\u00edficas; en otros casos, los manifestantes han usado hondas para arrojar piedras, bloqueado carreteras en v\u00edas cruciales, quemado edificios gubernamentales y tomado aeropuertos. Cuando la nueva presidenta, Dina Boluarte, exaliada de Castillo, declar\u00f3 en diciembre el estado de emergencia, los militares salieron a las calles para mantener el orden. Cientos de polic\u00edas y civiles han resultado heridos\n\nLa petici\u00f3n principal es que se celebren nuevas elecciones generales, que seg\u00fan las autoridades electorales podr\u00edan realizarse tan pronto como a fines de este a\u00f1o. El Congreso, integrado por muchos representantes reacios a ceder sus esca\u00f1os, rechaz\u00f3 un lapso tan ajustado, pero apoy\u00f3 una propuesta para una votaci\u00f3n en abril de 2024. Hasta la tarde del martes, Boluarte a\u00fan no hab\u00eda hecho comentarios sobre los disturbios desde que confirm\u00f3 la muerte del primer civil un d\u00eda antes, cuando pareci\u00f3 exasperada con las demandas de los manifestantes. \u201cLo \u00fanico que estaba en mi mano era el adelanto de elecciones, y ya lo propusimos\u201d, dijo Boluarte el lunes en un evento. \u201cEn paz y orden todo se puede lograr, en mitad de la violencia y el caos se complica m\u00e1s, se hace dif\u00edcil\u201d. El primer ministro Alberto Ot\u00e1rola, en rueda de prensa, culp\u00f3 a Castillo y a sus aliados de la muerte de los manifestantes, al afirmar que hab\u00edan incitado a ataques violentos destinados a desestabilizar al gobierno de Boluarte. \u201cEllos son los responsables\u201d, dijo, \u201cy no nuestros polic\u00edas\u201d. Ni tampoco \u201clos ciudadanos que aterrorizados ven c\u00f3mo estas hordas de delincuentes pretenden soliviantar el estado de derecho\u201d. El martes, Ot\u00e1rola dijo que la regi\u00f3n de Puno estar\u00eda sujeta a tres d\u00edas de toque de queda a partir de las 8 p. m.\n\nEstados Unidos, que ha expresado en repetidas ocasiones su apoyo al gobierno de Boluarte y anunci\u00f3 la semana pasada una nueva financiaci\u00f3n de ocho millones de d\u00f3lares para Per\u00fa destinada a apoyar los esfuerzos en la lucha contra el narcotr\u00e1fico, fue menos directo. \u201cEs urgente que se tomen medidas para detener esta dolorosa situaci\u00f3n de violencia y evitar la p\u00e9rdida de m\u00e1s vidas humanas\u201d, escribi\u00f3 en Twitter la embajadora estadounidense en Per\u00fa, Lisa Kenna. Tras la llegada de los primeros nueve cad\u00e1veres a un hospital de Juliaca el lunes por la tarde, Enrique Sotomayor, m\u00e9dico funcionario del hospital, dijo a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n locales que todos hab\u00edan recibido disparos de proyectiles de armas de fuego lo suficientemente potentes como para da\u00f1ar gravemente los \u00f3rganos internos. Samillan, el aspirante a neurocirujano, esperaba abrir alg\u00fan d\u00eda un hospital que atendiera a personas de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos, dijo su hermana. Estaba haciendo su internado en un hospital de Juliaca y el lunes, junto con otros voluntarios, hab\u00eda salido a la calle para ayudar a los manifestantes heridos.

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Shortly after the New Year, I was fired from Oak Ridge National Laboratory after urging fellow scientists to take action on climate change. At the American Geophysical Union meeting in December, just before speakers took the stage for a plenary session, my fellow climate scientist Peter Kalmus and I unfurled a banner that read, \u201cOut of the lab & into the streets.\u201d In the few seconds before the banner was ripped from our hands, we implored our colleagues to use their leverage as scientists to wake the public up to the dying planet. Soon after this brief action, the A.G.U., an organization with 60,000 members in the earth and space sciences, expelled us from the conference and withdrew the research that we presented that week from the program. Eventually it began a professional misconduct inquiry. (It\u2019s ongoing.) Then, on Jan. 3, Oak Ridge, the laboratory outside Knoxville where I had worked as an associate scientist for one year, terminated my employment. I am the first earth scientist I know of to be fired for climate activism. I fear I will not be the last. Oak Ridge said it was forced to fire me because I misused government resources by engaging in a personal activity on a work trip and because I did not adhere to its code of business ethics and conduct. The code has points on scientific integrity, maintaining the institution\u2019s reputation and using government resources \u201conly as authorized and appropriate and with integrity, responsibility and care.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr. Kalmus and I decided to make our statement during the lunch plenary session, I knew that we risked being asked to leave the stage or the conference. But I did not expect that our research would be removed from the program or that I would lose my job. When I began participating in climate actions with other scientists in 2022, senior managers at Oak Ridge asked that I make it clear to the public and the media that I spoke and acted on my own behalf. I followed these guidelines to the best of my ability, including at the A.G.U., where Dr. Kalmus, a scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and I did not mention our institutions in our statements. The retaliation I faced from the A.G.U. and Oak Ridge ultimately highlights a disappointing reality: that established scientific institutions will not even support scientists interrupting a meeting for the climate. I\u2019m all for decorum, but not when it will cost us the earth. I used to be a well-behaved scientist. I stood quietly on melting permafrost in Utqiagvik, Alaska, and measured how much greenhouse gas was released into the atmosphere. I filled spreadsheets and ran simulations about how warming temperatures would increase the carbon emissions from soil. To do my job, I dissociated the data I was working with from the terrifying future it represented. But in the field, smelling the dense rot of New England hemlock trees that were being eaten by a pest that now survives the warming winters, I felt loss and dread. Only my peers read my articles, which didn\u2019t seem to have any tangible effects. Though I saw firsthand the oncoming catastrophe of climate change, I felt powerless to help. I did, however, believe that if scientists told the truth about the climate emergency, our scientific institutions would get out the message to policymakers, government officials, the media and the public. But they didn\u2019t \u2014 at least not sufficiently \u2014 even as carbon emissions continued to rise and the climate continued to warm.\n\nA few years ago, Scientist Rebellion, an international network of scientists concerned about climate change, began a series of strategic acts of nonviolent civil disobedience. After years of waiting in vain for meaningful public action to address climate change, I decided to join them. For my first action, I chained myself to a White House gate to demand that the Biden administration declare a climate emergency. Since I locked that first chain around my waist, I have been arrested three times in nonviolent actions. My superiors at Oak Ridge warned me to be careful but did not discipline me. But I was motivated to continue because these scientist-led political campaigns have attracted positive media attention and contributed to major policy wins. At the end of last year, a group of us protested the impact of luxury travel at more than a dozen private airport terminals in 13 countries; within a month of our actions, the Podemos party of Spain submitted a request to the European Commission to take measures to reduce the use of private planes. When scientists take action, people listen. The scientific community has tried writing dutiful reports for decades, with no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels to show for it. It is time to try something new. We must work to change the culture of our institutions, be honest about our values, advocate climate justice and experiment. Great experiments push at the boundaries of knowledge and propriety. They are risky, volatile, blasphemous. But when they work, the world changes. Scientific institutions should support activism and advocacy, especially by experts. The A.G.U. should do more to publicly support policies informed by its members\u2019 science, such as declaring a climate emergency and ending fossil fuel extraction and subsidies. I did not make the decision to become an activist lightly; I recognized that my actions would have consequences, and I knew that I could face retaliation. But inaction during this critical time will have far greater consequences.",

            "section": "Magazine",
            "content": "When my ex-husband left me, I received a series of texts from his sister. She and I had a close relationship for the 16-year duration of my marriage, which started when she was a teenager. In the texts, she told me that I should be happy to be rid of him. When I questioned her, she told me that he sexually abused her when she was 5 and he was 12. She had told her parents, who put an end to it, but she and her brother didn\u2019t receive any healing therapy. It was swept under the rug. I sat on this shocking and disturbing information for a few days, had him confirm it and then wrote back to my now-former sister-in-law that I was heartbroken for her and devastated to learn that this was the person I had married. I also told her that I felt hurt that she was telling me only now: Why had his entire family known about this horrible thing and let me marry him and have children with him? She responded by saying that my ex-husband and I deserved each other, and she and I haven\u2019t spoken since. Am I wrong to be angry that the entire family kept me in the dark and that they let me enter into a union with a monster like that and didn\u2019t worry about my children when they came along? Was she wrong to tell me after the fact \u2014 should I have been left in ignorance? If he remarries someone with children, should she be warned? I have not told my children, but if they have babies of their own, should I let them know so he is never alone with our grandchildren? Where does it end? This causes me many sleepless nights, even though we\u2019ve now been split up for nearly a decade. Name Withheld Whether your in-laws should have told you what your fianc\u00e9 did when he was 12 depends, in part, on what they thought it signified about his behavior as an adult. Having, as your sister-in-law says, put an end to it, and having no evidence that he had done anything similar later on, they might well have thought it was behind him and that he posed no danger to children, including any you might have.\n\nCould they have been right about this? You don\u2019t say you have any evidence that he abused children as an adult. Statistically speaking, juveniles who commit sex crimes \u2014 as your in-laws may have known \u2014 do seem to be different from adults who do so; the available research suggests that few such juveniles reoffend when they are grown up. It\u2019s nonetheless unfortunate that no therapy was offered to the siblings. Adolescents who have offended seem to respond better to treatment than adults do, and your sister-in-law is clearly still distressed by what happened and by the way her family handled the matter. Suppose your then-fianc\u00e9, as seems typical of those with a history like his, posed no threat to children. Did you have a right to know that the person you planned to marry had, at a young age, done a terrible thing, even if he wasn\u2019t prone to do anything like it again? We rightly try not to define adults by offenses they committed as children. Still, you could feel that his family should have urged him to tell you about it and allowed him to express whatever remorse and revulsion he might have come to feel about his childhood acts. But that\u2019s all in the past; you\u2019ve been divorced for years. Contemplating the future, you wonder whether you may, one day, have to inform other people in your ex-husband\u2019s life about his juvenile misconduct in order to protect their children. No doubt you\u2019re worried that your motives here are mixed: The resentment you clearly feel toward this man might lead you to pass on the news just to embarrass him. I note that you were able to call him to ask if his sister\u2019s allegations were true. He gave you an honest answer. If circumstances arise in which you wonder whether you should tell someone about his past, you might talk to him first and listen to what he has to say in response. My sister and her husband have a very negative parenting style with their son. They are constantly yelling at him or telling him he\u2019s doing something wrong. The child does act out sometimes. They have sent him to therapy before, but not with much success, and they don\u2019t seem to recognize that their parenting style may be influencing his behavior. It has gotten to the point that several of my family members have commented on their negativity, and it\u2019s difficult to spend time with them. We do get along well with their son, and so do my kids. Once, when I had a young child and they didn\u2019t yet have children, I needed to have a conversation with my sister because she and her husband were not nice to my son. It\u2019s one thing to bring up adults\u2019 bad behavior when it\u2019s directed at your own child; it\u2019s harder when it\u2019s their parenting style toward their own child. What should I do? I feel stuck, because I do not want to ruin my family\u2019s relationship with her family. Name Withheld\n\nYou\u2019re right that it\u2019s much easier to complain when people mistreat your child than when they mistreat their own. But aunts and uncles have a place in shaping a child\u2019s life, especially if that child is going to be around their own children. The trouble is that people are sensitive about criticism of their parenting, including criticism from those they know are motivated by love. The fact that this child has been in therapy suggests his parents are aware that there\u2019s a problem, even if they don\u2019t see that they are part of it. I wonder whether, with your encouragement, they might be willing to consider family therapy. An independent expert might be in a position to recognize their badgering behavior as harmful and suggest strategies for a more positive approach. I live in an apartment in San Francisco, and for the last two years, I have been subjected to uncontrolled dog barking, door slamming and loud talking from an obnoxious neighbor. I have a brain injury that \u2014 as I told the neighbor the first day she moved in \u2014 makes me painfully sensitive to loud, repetitive noise. She has since acquired a second poorly behaved dog (the first is supposedly a support animal) and a loud boyfriend, and now works loudly on speakerphone from home all day, adjacent to my bedroom wall. The landlady told me this is my problem and to work it out. I have done all I can think of to adjust myself, but the noise is audible over earplugs and headphones. We are a family of three who have lived here for decades, in an affordable apartment that we need. I would appreciate your perspective. Name Withheld I assume that you have raised these issues with your neighbor; given that she knows about your disability, her behavior seems especially unkind. At this point, you might explore potential legal remedies. You won\u2019t be losing a friend if you take advantage of them, in light of your neighbor\u2019s apparent indifference toward maintaining civil relations. In San Francisco, you can certainly ask the city to check whether the sounds exceed the legal limit, although responsibility for noise control is distributed among several municipal departments. (Audio recordings might be helpful in this situation.) Going to war against people you live among can have noxious consequences. As for where to direct the request, you could call 311 and ask for guidance or you could confer with the right kind of lawyer \u2014 probably a landlord-tenant lawyer. Your landlord told you that this was your problem to deal with, but according to a summary of the administrative codes published by the San Francisco Police Department, she has a legal duty \u201cto exercise diligence to minimize exposure to noise.\u201d A lawyer\u2019s letter could remind her of these responsibilities. You might have grounds to file a private nuisance suit against your landlord or against your neighbor. Even if the noise level is not illegal, you can go to Community Boards, a local nonprofit conflict-resolution agency, to seek mediation.",

But it was another awards show later in the week that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The Golden Globes \u2014 which NBC refused to air last year after an investigation by The Los Angeles Times documented financial and ethical lapses at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and revealed that it had no Black members \u2014 are returning on Tuesday night, after the foreign press association outlined its plans for reform. And the question now is which of the nominees will show up. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued as to how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d said the director Martin McDonagh, whose Irish drama \u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d was nominated for a pack-leading eight Globes, and who said he planned to attend. \u201cI have some thoughts on it that, if I get up there, I might express. I think it\u2019s the start of a process that hopefully is trending in the right direction.\u201d\n\nDanielle Deadwyler won a Gotham Award for outstanding lead performance for her role as Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, in \u201cTill,\u201d but she wasn\u2019t nominated for a Golden Globe. She said that she didn\u2019t plan to watch the show live \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t have a TV,\u201d she said bluntly \u2014 but that she would probably Google the winners afterward.

Because what does that mean for nonbinary people? Why is there a point to choose? \u201cWe should smash them in,\u201d she added.\n\nIn an era of declining awards show viewership \u2014 just 6.9 million people watched the Globes broadcast in 2021, a record low, compared with the 91.6 million who watched that year\u2019s Super Bowl on CBS \u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to question how much the Globes, or any awards, ultimately matter. \u201cIt means that more people are seeing the film,\u201d Mr. McDonagh said. \u201cBeing in the conversation helps all that.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s significant to recognize people,\u201d Ms. Deadwyler said. \u201cBut they always make it seem like a race. It would be great if it could just be recognized in the same way that the Nobel Prizes are \u2014 just say, \u2018Oh, hey, this person has done something significant to society.\u2019\u201d There were plenty of honors handed out at Sunday night\u2019s National Board of Review ceremony \u2014 18 in all, including best actor and actress awards for Colin Farrell (\u201cThe Banshees of Inisherin\u201d) and Michelle Yeoh (\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d) \u2014 a traditionally boozy and irreverent gathering that is not televised, and for which the winners are announced in advance.\n\nThere was also plenty of mingling in the banquet hall and around the three open bars before the dinner portion of the evening \u2014 fish and cucumber salad \u2014 kicked off. Ms. Deadwyler, the \u201cTill\u201d director Chinonye Chukwu and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, who won best supporting actress for her role in \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d posed for a group photo.

            "section": "Your Money",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nProposed changes to federal student-loan repayment plans tied to income could cut some borrowers\u2019 monthly payments by more than half.\n\nThe Education Department on Tuesday released long-awaited details on a piece of President Biden\u2019s student loan debt plan that would enable millions of borrowers to cut their monthly federal payments by more than half \u2014 perhaps the most consequential component of the president\u2019s broader initiative to make the loan system more manageable. The Education Department\u2019s proposed rules would revise one of its existing income-driven repayment plans \u2014 known as REPAYE \u2014 in which borrowers\u2019 monthly payments are tied to their income and family size, and after a set number of years, any remaining debt is forgiven. Unlike Mr. Biden\u2019s one-time initiative to cancel up to $20,000 in federal debt, which has been stymied by legal challenges, the new repayment plan would become a permanent fixture of the student loan infrastructure and apply to current and future borrowers. The latest iteration of REPAYE will be the most affordable of the five existing plans, the first of which became available in 1995. Like the others, it doesn\u2019t do anything to slow the rising cost of higher education, instead providing a new way to cope.\n\nA significant and rising share of borrowers is already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, which are intended to ease the pressure when debtors can\u2019t afford their monthly bill. Roughly 8.5 million federal student loan borrowers are enrolled in existing plans, representing about a third of all borrowers in repayment, up from 1.6 million, or 10 percent, in 2013. It\u2019s still unclear when the new plan will be up and running: The proposal will be subject to public comment for 30 days, and the administration will take that feedback into account before the rule becomes final later this year. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s expected to work, with updates to follow as we learn more. Who is eligible for the new repayment plan? But undergraduate borrowers are eligible for lower payments than graduate borrowers. Parents who borrowed to pay for their children\u2019s schooling using Parent PLUS loans cannot enroll in the new plan. That means if parent borrowers cannot afford to make their payments, they generally have access only to the most expensive income-driven repayment plan \u2014 known as income-contingent repayment \u2014 which requires borrowers to pay 20 percent of their discretionary income for 25 years; anything remaining is forgiven.\n\nDoes this updated plan mean others will shut down? In the past, new repayment plans didn\u2019t lead to the shuttering of older ones, which is why there\u2019s a confusing assortment of options on the books. (The amended REPAYE plan is generally more affordable than the four other (!) existing plans, including Pay as You Earn, Income-Contingent Repayment and Income-Based Repayment, which comes in two versions.) But the Biden administration said it wanted to simplify the choices so that borrowers weren\u2019t overwhelmed: It proposed phasing out new enrollments into the PAYE and I.C.R. plans, while limiting the circumstances where a borrower can later switch into the I.B.R. plan. Borrowers with Parent PLUS loans, however, will not lose access to the I.C.R. plan, according to senior administration officials. They can continue to enroll in that plan after they consolidate into a so-called direct consolidation loan. How does the new repayment plan work? First, some quick background: All income-driven plans generally operate in the same fashion. Payments are calculated based on your earnings and household size, and are readjusted each year. After monthly payments are made for a set number of years \u2014 usually 20 \u2014 any remaining balance is forgiven. (The balance is taxable as income, though a temporary tax rule exempts balances forgiven through 2025 from federal income taxes.) The revised REPAYE plan would become more generous in several ways. To start, it would reduce payments on undergraduate loans to 5 percent of discretionary income, down from 10 percent in the existing REPAYE plan (and 15 percent in other plans). Graduate debt is also eligible, but borrowers would pay 10 percent of discretionary income on that portion. If you hold both undergraduate and graduate debt, your payment will be weighted accordingly. But the new rules also tweak the payment formula so that more income is protected for a borrower\u2019s basic needs, which in turn reduces payments overall. That change will also allow more low-income workers to qualify for zero-dollar payments.\n\nOnce you pay for basic needs like food and rent, any leftover income is considered discretionary income. In the land of federal student loans, income-driven repayment plans require borrowers to pay a percentage of their discretionary income. The proposed plan tweaks the payment formula so that more income is protected, generating less discretionary income and a lower payment. In the current REPAYE program, discretionary income is defined as income in excess of a protected amount set at 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline. It\u2019s not much. That means single borrowers start making payments on income above roughly $20,400 (or just above $41,600 for a family of four). The revised REPAYE plan would increase the amount of income protected from repayment to 225 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. That means no worker earning under 225 percent of the poverty level \u2014 or what a $15 minimum wage worker earns annually \u2014 will have to make a payment, the administration said. Put another way, a single borrower who makes less than $30,500 would make $0 monthly payments. The same goes for a borrower in a household of four with income below $62,400. Are there any changes for borrowers with small loan balances? Yes. People who took out smaller loans \u2014 or those with original balances of $12,000 or less in total \u2014 would make monthly payments for 10 years before cancellation, instead of the more typical 20-year repayment period. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above the $12,000 amount would add one year of monthly payments before the balance is forgiven. Will the way interest is treated change? Yes. Unlike other existing income-driven plans, borrowers\u2019 loan balances will not grow as long as they make their monthly payments, even when they are not required to make any payments because their income is too low.\n\nIn the proposed plan, if a borrower\u2019s payment isn\u2019t high enough to cover the interest due that month, the remaining interest will not be charged or tacked onto the balance. That will be a huge relief to borrowers who diligently make payments yet still see their balances balloon over the decades because they\u2019re not paying enough to cover the interest owed. How much will my payment decrease under the new plan? Undergraduate borrowers will receive the most significant savings, though graduate borrowers will benefit, too. Borrowers who rank among the bottom 30 percent of earners (or families with earnings less than $29,000 on average) would qualify for payments that are 83 percent lower per dollar borrowed over their lifetimes, on average, according to the Education Department, while those in the top 30 percent of earners (families with earnings exceeding $90,000) would see only a 5 percent reduction. A single borrower with an income below $30,500 per year would not be required to make any monthly payments \u2014 nor would a borrower in a household of four with income below $62,400. Will my spouse\u2019s income be included in my payment calculation? It depends on how you file your federal income tax return. Married borrowers who file their federal income tax return separately would be permitted to exclude their spouse from both their household income and family size. But joint filers must include any income earned by their spouse. The Education Department has proposed applying this rule to all income-driven repayment plans, not just the revised REPAYE program, to lessen confusion and simplify the application process.\n\nThe proposed rule change would automatically enroll borrowers who are at least 75 days behind on their payments into a plan that will provide the lowest payment. This proposed change would apply to borrowers for whom the Education Department has approval to get their income information from the Internal Revenue Service. What if my loans were in default? For the first time, borrowers in default would be permitted to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan. But there\u2019s a catch: The proposed rule would only permit defaulted borrowers to enroll in the Income-Based Repayment plan, which has higher payments than the new REPAYE program. Can I enroll in the new plan before loan payments are set to resume? That\u2019s hard to predict with any certainty, but probably not. It\u2019s not yet clear when the new program will be ready for borrowers or when payments will resume. And even after the revised plan\u2019s rules are finalized, loan servicers and the Education Department will still have to update their systems. \u201cBut the Department has perhaps made it easier for itself and for borrowers by amending the terms of an existing plan \u2014 the REPAYE plan \u2014 rather than creating a totally new plan as it previously proposed,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on student loan issues. \u201cAs a result, it can work from the existing REPAYE architecture, and borrowers who are already enrolled in REPAYE won\u2019t have to change plans.\u201d Student loan payments have been postponed for most federal borrowers since March 2020 as part of a pandemic relief measure. The Biden administration has said that the payment pause would continue until the Education Department is allowed to move ahead with its debt cancellation plan or the litigation is resolved. But if those matters have not been settled by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that. Borrowers will be notified in advance.\n\nWill anyone be automatically enrolled in the revised plan? Yes. Borrowers who are already enrolled in the existing REPAYE plan won\u2019t have to change plans. Can I switch from another repayment plan to the revised one? Will my repayment clock restart if I switch plans? No, borrowers generally receive credit when they switch from one income-driven plan to another. What should I do in the meantime? If you can\u2019t afford the standard payment plan, you should probably consider one of the existing income-driven repayment plans, including REPAYE: Borrowers in this plan would benefit from lower payments after the revised program replaces the existing one. Other repayment options may better suit your circumstances, and they can sometimes yield lower payment amounts. Those include the standard (with fixed payments), graduated (your payments rise) and extended (you pay over a longer time) repayment plans. Options that pause payments should generally be used as a last resort: Requesting a deferment or forbearance will temporarily postpone payments, but there can be significant added costs in the long run. I\u2019m still confused. Where can I get more help? There are tools and services that can help. The loan simulator tool at StudentAid.gov will guide you through the existing options and help you decide which plan best fits your goals \u2014 finding the lowest-payment plan, for example, versus paying loans off as soon as possible. The tool is easy to use. When you sign into your Student Aid account, it should automatically use your loans in its calculations. (You can manually add other federal loans if any are missing.) You can also look at plans side by side to compare how much they\u2019ll each cost over time, both monthly and in total, and if any debt would be forgiven. Besides your loan servicer, groups like The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, known as TISLA, can provide free guidance on what options may work best for you. For New York State residents, EDCAP, a nonprofit organization focused on student loans, also offers help. And some employers and other organizations have hired companies like Summer, which helps borrowers sort through the options.",

The package, backed by the House on a mostly party-line vote, does not detail all of the concessions made by Kevin McCarthy to nail down the votes he needed to be elected speaker \u2014 such as the allocation of prime committee assignments \u2014 some of which were handshake deals or would require further action by House Republicans. Republicans said the new rules empower individual lawmakers to have a greater voice in legislation and advance the party\u2019s goal of limiting spending. \u201cIt reflects Republican priorities and the priorities of the voters who elected us,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Rules Committee, said about the package.\n\nBut the rules could also make it difficult for the House to carry out even its most basic duties in the next two years, such as funding the government, including the military, or avoiding a catastrophic federal debt default. Here is a closer look at the package: An easy ouster for the speaker Perhaps the most discussed change in the rules is the restoration of a provision that permits a single lawmaker to force a vote to \u201cvacate the chair,\u201d allowing a snap vote to remove the speaker. Historically that had been the position of the House, but lawmakers refrained from employing that weapon until 2015, when hard-right Republicans used it as a threat to force out Speaker John A. Boehner. Democrats then changed the rules to necessitate that a majority of House members get behind the motion; Republicans have now reverted to requiring a single member. The 118th Congress is underway, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding the Senate.\n\u2022 None A Wide-Ranging Inquiry: The House approved the The House approved the creation of a committee to scrutinize what Republicans say is the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against conservatives. Democrats and historians see dark historical parallels\n\u2022 None Abortion: As part of an anti-abortion rights effort, House Republicans pushed through a bill that could As part of an anti-abortion rights effort, House Republicans pushed through a bill that could subject doctors who perform abortions to criminal penalties\n\u2022 None I.R.S. Funds: Republicans in the House voted to Republicans in the House voted to cut funding for the Internal Revenue Service , as conservative lawmakers try to kneecap President Biden\u2019s $80 billion overhaul of the agency.\n\u2022 None Nebraska: Former Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, a Republican, Former Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, a Republican, was appointed as the state\u2019s next senator , replacing Ben Sasse, who resigned to become president of the University of Florida. Mr. McCarthy had hoped to keep the threshold higher, proposing that at least five members of the House must make the motion. But he relented under pressure. Because a motion to vacate would be \u201cprivileged,\u201d it could be raised and receive a vote at any time, whether House leaders wanted it to or not.\n\nThe rules open the way for new committees to explore the nation\u2019s competitiveness with China, examine what Republicans called \u201cthe weaponization\u201d of federal law enforcement agencies in politically charged investigations and assess the federal government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The package imposes rules to try to limit spending, including blocking consideration of legislation that would increase mandatory spending, which is how many social safety net programs are financed. Republicans are also requiring a supermajority vote of the House to raise taxes. In a provision that could make it easier to cut taxes, the new rules direct congressional budget offices to try to calculate the \u201cmacroeconomic\u201d effect of tax reductions, an approach that could lower the estimated impact of tax cuts on the federal deficit. The rules also call for legislation to be judged for its potential contribution to inflation. The package also includes adoption of the so-called Holman rule, which allows lawmakers to use spending bills to defund specific programs and fire federal officials or reduce their pay. Facing a looming confrontation over raising the federal debt limit in the coming months, Republicans eliminated the so-called Gephardt rule, which in the past has allowed the House to skirt a vote on the politically charged issue and automatically increase the federal government\u2019s borrowing power. Republicans intend to try to leverage their future consideration of any debt increase to obtain steep spending cuts, something they could not do under rules that allowed an automatic increase. Under their new rules, Republicans will allow lawmakers at least 72 hours to review legislation before it goes to the floor for a House vote, responding to a chief complaint of members who have been angered by voluminous, costly legislation offered up at the last minute as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Such requirements have existed in the past, however, and have often been waived when time was short. The rules put in place other technical changes framed as efforts to improve transparency around legislation by trying to restrict measures to a single topic and making it easier to eliminate provisions in a bill not considered germane to the main focus. Facing the prospect of more votes on amendments in the months ahead as Republicans try to open up the House floor, the rules also allow the party to give lawmakers just two minutes to record their votes when the leadership decides such a time limit is necessary. The shortest time frame previously was five minutes.\n\nThe rules could hamper investigations by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which undertakes bipartisan inquiries and then makes recommendations for discipline to the Ethics Committee. One rule imposes term limits for board members, with the result of removing all but one Democrat from the board at a time when it is considering whether to open an inquiry into certain Republican congressmen over their conduct related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The rules also require the board to approve the hiring of investigators within the first 30 days of a new Congress, which some ethics watchdogs fear could cause the office to go understaffed if hires are not made within that window. (Republicans contend that the rules ensure investigators are accountable to the board.) \u201cThese are measures that will render the ethics office ineffectual and which no member, from either party, should support,\u201d said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist with the watchdog group Public Citizen. The rules approved on Monday end proxy voting and remote committee hearings for lawmakers, after Democrats put the practices in place at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. With their slim majority, Republicans will now need to keep lawmakers in Washington for longer periods to be certain they have the votes to advance their legislation. The package also rolls back staff unionization, an effort that began in earnest during the previous Congress, and which Democrats passed legislation to facilitate. House Republicans also used the rules package to bolster their policy agenda, including a focus on supporting fossil fuel development and trying to restrict the Biden administration from drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The package specifically allows consideration of legislation to require that any future release of oil from the reserve be contingent upon oil production on federal lands in the United States. The measure is unlikely to win support in the Senate or with President Biden, who as a candidate vowed to end new oil and gas leases for federal lands and waters.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe two scions from notorious family dynasties clinched landslide election victories in 2022, but their power balance remains fragile.\n\nDAVAO CITY, the Philippines \u2014 When President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. hugged his vice-presidential running mate Sara Duterte at her inauguration in June, it looked like a euphoric moment in the Philippines: two of the nation\u2019s most prominent political families coming together in the name of unity after landslide election victories. But the fact that she had decided to have her own ceremony separate from his and the behavior of her father, Rodrigo Duterte, the former president, spoke to the tensions near the surface. As everyone embraced and shook hands with his daughter, Mr. Duterte grimaced, tight-lipped and impatient. He stood stiffly next to Mr. Marcos, his successor as president, during a photo op. Rather than hug any of the Marcoses there to congratulate his daughter on her vice-presidential win, Mr. Duterte walked away.\n\nCritics have warned that the Marcos-Duterte administration is little more than a marriage of convenience between two notorious families out to protect their own interests. Policy disagreements have already emerged. Though Mr. Marcos defended Mr. Duterte\u2019s vicious war on drugs, for example, he has taken a much softer approach as president, drawing his country closer to the United States, which Mr. Duterte once called a \u201clousy\u201d nation. Ms. Duterte has shown that she will not be an ordinary vice president, a role that typically exists in the shadows of the president. Her budget is already three times the size of her predecessor, Leni Robredo. Allegiance in the Philippines has long been determined by bloodlines and regional loyalties, with political dynasties jockeying for power and influence. That system was born centuries ago during Spanish colonial rule and later flourished under the Americans, who introduced democratic elections but limited the vote to landowning aristocrats. In that vacuum, family names flourished. Today, up to 70 percent of Congress is made up of just a few families.\n\nNow, all eyes are on the Marcoses and the Dutertes as they try to improve the lives of millions of Filipinos and deliver on the promise of national unity in spite of a political system that has tended to favor factionalism. \u201cThe problem in Philippine politics, historically, is that such a big alliance is hard to maintain,\u201d said Aries Arugay, who studies Philippine electoral politics. \u201cThere\u2019s so many interests to take into account, there\u2019s so many mouths to feed. And sooner or later, there will be dissatisfaction and discontent.\u201d Among the political establishment in the Philippines, no family has embedded itself quite as thoroughly as the Marcoses. The father, Ferdinand E. Marcos, ruled with an iron fist for more than two decades. The mother, Imelda, was elected four times to the House of Representatives. The younger Mr. Marcos, known by his childhood nickname \u201cBongbong,\u201d has been the vice-governor and governor of a province, a congressman and a senator. His older sister Imee is a senator, too. His son, Sandro, was elected to Congress last year, and a cousin, Martin Romualdez, is the speaker of the House. Much of the family\u2019s political authority is based in Ilocos Norte, the Marcos family stronghold. But their influence waned after the fall of the regime in 1986. Years later, the Marcoses found a solution in the Dutertes.\n\nUntil that meeting, Ms. Duterte had not seriously considered running for vice president. Intrigued by the proposal, she commissioned surveys focused on her potential. They showed that voters would handily support her in the role. Ten days after the meeting, Mr. Marcos stunned the country by announcing that Ms. Duterte would run for vice president and support his bid for the presidency. Mr. Duterte later told reporters that his daughter had not consulted him about her plans. He lashed out by calling Mr. Marcos a \u201cweak leader\u201d and a \u201cspoiled child.\u201d The person he had hoped would continue his legacy was his favorite among his four children, Sara. \u201cWe were all shocked,\u201d said Amado Santos Munda Jr., a family friend. \u201cEverybody thought that his daughter will be president because of the surveys. And remember that usually in the Philippines, the president\u2019s children become presidents.\u201d Ms. Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Reynold Munsayac, said that \u201csome parts\u201d of this account of the meeting in Cebu City were incorrect, but that Ms. Duterte \u201cdoes not wish to elaborate.\u201d Mr. Marcos\u2019s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Marcos and Ms. Duterte have worked hard to project a unified political front. Ms. Duterte recently defended the use of the phrase \u201cNew Society\u201d in a new textbook referring to the martial law years, brushing off complaints that it was another example of the Marcoses trying to downplay the father\u2019s brutal dictatorship. Both families have patriarchs accused of human rights abuses and corruption, and are facing multiple legal challenges. So far, they have moved in lock step to protect one another. The administration announced in September that it had rejected a request by the International Criminal Court to continue an investigation into Mr. Duterte\u2019s violent war on drugs. A tax evasion case against Mr. Marcos has been put on hold, though the family still owes billions in unpaid estate taxes to the government.\n\nMs. Robredo, the main opposition candidate in the presidential race, attracted a groundswell of support from young voters during the election in part for her dedication to rooting out the corruption. Fearful of Ms. Robredo\u2019s grass-roots movement, the Estradas and the Arroyos, two former presidential families who were once prosecuted for corruption in the Philippines, backed the Marcos-Duterte ticket. \u201cThat is our challenge right now,\u201d said Ronald Mendoza, a former dean of the Ateneo School of Government, referring to political dynasties. \u201cWe know that they are not healthy for our democracy, and yet it\u2019s becoming normalized.\u201d With Mr. Marcos\u2019s backing, Ms. Duterte has been given $2.6 million in funds that were meant for intelligence operations because she says she needs to make schools safer. She has also asked for $41.2 million from Congress for her office. \u2018She has a mind of her own\u2019 Few alliances between two families have survived for very long in the Philippines. The last time a powerful alliance fractured was in 1987, when Salvador Laurel, then the vice president, broke with President Corazon Aquino. Their split added to the turmoil that gripped the country after the end of martial law imposed by the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nSeveral analysts point to Ms. Duterte\u2019s separate inauguration ceremony and Mr. Marcos\u2019s decision to also appoint her education secretary \u2014 instead of defense, as she had requested \u2014 as a sign of brewing tension. Ms. Duterte told a Times reporter that she was not disappointed with the job Mr. Marcos gave her, saying \u201cthe defense portfolio was a discussion we had before we became a tandem.\u201d Straight talking and charismatic, the 44-year-old mother of three is beloved among many Filipinos. Before she expressed any interest in running in the presidential election, hundreds of \u201cRun, Sara, Run\u201d groups had formed throughout the country. She clinched the vice-presidential election with the largest majority since 1969, garnering 32 million votes, exceeding the 31 million votes earned by Mr. Marcos. As an army reserve colonel, she almost certainly has the loyalty of the military. Leni Hernandez, Ms. Duterte\u2019s high school teacher, described her as \u201cheadstrong.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure that she\u2019ll carry as vice president,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot dominate her.\u201d At times, Ms. Duterte has even defied her father. When he was president, she branched out to form her own regional political party, with many senior politicians flying to Davao to gain her support. When her father asked her to endorse his right-hand man for president in the election, she rebuffed him. Ramon Beleno III, a political science professor at the Ateneo De Davao, said Mr. Marcos\u2019s decision to deny Ms. Duterte the defense portfolio suggested that he was concerned about giving her a more crucial role. \u201cThen she might end up overshadowing him,\u201d he said. Experts say Ms. Duterte could position herself as a strong candidate for the presidency in 2028, when Mr. Marcos\u2019s term ends. In her first 100 days in office, she has established satellite offices in key cities across the Philippines, the first for a vice president. She has met more than a dozen diplomats, including China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nPeople who know her say the Marcoses will have to tread lightly. \u201cSara is very kind but do not provoke her because she can be a tiger,\u201d said Salvador Panelo, Mr. Duterte\u2019s lawyer who represented the daughter after she punched a sheriff in Davao for disobeying government orders. Mr. Panelo said that before midterm elections in 2025, Mr. Marcos needed to follow through on any promises that he had made to the Dutertes during the campaign. \u201cIf not,\u201d he warned \u201cwithin three years, they might be at each other\u2019s throat.\u201d",

            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nIn August 1982 I arrived in Washington to begin a year working at the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Yes, it was the Reagan administration, and I was already a liberal. But it was a technocratic position rather than a political one, and the council\u2019s new chair, Martin Feldstein \u2014 a moderate Republican of a type that has largely vanished since \u2014 wanted some whiz kids to crunch the data. I was supposed to focus on international issues; the new hire for domestic economics was a guy named Larry Summers. What ever happened to him? Anyway, Marty and I had a working dinner on my arrival night, and he had one big question to ask: \u201cIs the world economy about to collapse?\u201d There were two main reasons for his concern. One was that Mexico had just announced it was unable to keep paying its debts, marking the beginning of the Latin American debt crisis. The other was that the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to fight inflation had sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin, with the nation experiencing its worst recession since the 1930s, not to be rivaled until the financial crisis of 2008. But as it turned out, the world economy didn\u2019t collapse. The debt crisis produced a \u201clost decade\u201d in Latin America, with widespread economic suffering, but it didn\u2019t spread into a global contagion. And further north, a policy U-turn by the Fed eventually jump-started a rapid recovery; by 1984 Ronald Reagan was boasting about \u201cmorning in America.\u201d\n\nStill, the memory of that summer makes me a bit nervous about the economic optimism that seems to be breaking out all over right now, at least in the media. Predictions of a \u201csoft landing\u201d \u2014 inflation falling to acceptable levels without a recession \u2014 are proliferating. And my own prediction is indeed for a softish landing: Inflation does seem to be coming down, and while we might not completely avoid a recession, if we have one it will probably be mild. But the experience of the early 1980s still offers two reasons for caution. First, controlling inflation in the \u201980s was extremely painful. Here\u2019s what used to be the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of underlying inflation (I\u2019ll talk about recent problems with that measure in a minute) versus the unemployment rate from 1979 to 1985:\n\nInflation did come down, from around 10 percent to around 4 percent. But the process of disinflation involved a huge, sustained bulge in unemployment. In the economics jargon of the time, there was a very high sacrifice ratio. In late 1984, when Reagan was talking about how great the economy was, the unemployment rate was more than twice what it is right now. Some people are talking as if we\u2019re going to need to go through a similar ordeal again. At least until a few months ago, Larry Summers was laying out 1980s-type scenarios for disinflation, saying that unemployment would need to rise to close to 6 percent to get inflation under control.\n\nI think he\u2019s wrong. Pandemic-related distortions have made it much harder to estimate underlying inflation, to the point where we\u2019re not even sure what the term truly means, but many of the measures that have been devised in an attempt to cut through the fog are showing moderating inflation even though we have yet to see a rise in unemployment. For example, here\u2019s one measure from the New York Fed, multivariate core trend \u2014 trust me, it\u2019s a smart, sensible approach, although not definitive:\n\nIf we believe this measure, or what seems to be a downward trend in wage growth, inflation has moderated substantially already \u2014 again, without a big rise in unemployment. So, as I said, I think Larry is being far too pessimistic. But am I sure? Of course not. The other reason the experience of the 1980s still weighs on me is that it was clear in 1982 that the Fed had braked harder than it intended. That is, it was trying to slow the economy down \u2014 it had, in effect, deliberately caused a recession \u2014 but it didn\u2019t mean to cause a recession that severe. The truth is that then, as now, policymakers were trying to manage the economy with limited, often out-of-date information and using highly imprecise tools. Specifically, the Fed is trying to reduce inflation by slowing the economy, which it is doing in turn by raising interest rates. But there\u2019s a raging debate over how much the economy needs to slow, how much rates need to rise to achieve a given amount of slowdown and how long rate hikes need to take full effect. I sometimes think of the Fed as trying to operate heavy machinery in a dark room \u2014 while wearing heavy mittens. So, even if we don\u2019t need a severe recession to get inflation under control, we might get one anyway if the Fed brakes too hard. There is, of course, the opposite risk: that the Fed will do too little and inflation won\u2019t come under control. But I think the inflation news has been good enough to justify taking that risk by going easy on rate hikes at least for a while. The bottom line? A soft landing has become much more plausible than it seemed a few months ago. But it\u2019s not at all a done deal. A view from White House staff on the inflation situation. Financial markets are very optimistic about inflation.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nThe rain caused flooding in downtown Los Angeles and beyond. California\u2019s Central Coast appeared to be the hardest hit area after the latest waves of moisture known as atmospheric rivers.\n\nCARPINTERIA, Calif. \u2014 As rain lashed Southern California on Monday night, parts of Los Angeles County experienced flooding \u2014 an unusual twist for a typically dry, sunny place where people tend to worry about droughts. A flash flood warning for southwestern Los Angeles County that had been issued before 7 p.m. expired early Tuesday. The warning affected nearly 8 million of the more than 10 million residents in the county, the most populous in the United States. The full extent of flooding in the Los Angeles area was not immediately clear in the predawn hours of Tuesday morning. California\u2019s Central Coast, where officials had ordered evacuations on Monday in a coastal enclave of Santa Barbara County, appeared to be the hardest hit area of a state that has been battered in recent weeks by powerful waves of moisture, known as atmospheric rivers. But the Weather Service had warned on Monday evening that downtown Los Angeles, Malibu, Hollywood and Beverly Hills were among the places that would experience flash flooding. And as more than an inch of rain fell in some areas of the county that night, early images showed cars partially submerged by floods near downtown. The Los Angeles Fire Department also told an NBC affiliate that firefighters had rescued two people who were trapped inside a vehicle at the bottom of a sinkhole that opened in the Chatsworth area, north of downtown L.A.\n\nUp to a foot of rain was expected to soak Montecito\u2019s already drenched hillsides. And the evacuation orders were issued five years to the day that a deadly torrent of mud and boulders rushed through neighborhoods in that mansion community, killing 23 people and turning it into a disaster area. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a series of significant and powerful storms,\u201d Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County said in a briefing. \u201cCurrently, we\u2019re experiencing a storm that is causing many problems and has the potential to cause major problems across our county, especially in the burn scar areas.\u201d\n\nLate Sunday, President Biden approved an emergency declaration for 17 counties in California, allowing for federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security in relief and rescue efforts. Elsewhere along the Central Coast, one person was killed by floodwater while trying to navigate a submerged road in San Luis Obispo County, north of Santa Barbara, officials said on Monday. A 5-year-old boy remained missing. Residents were evacuated from numerous communities because of flood risks as their streets turned into gushing streams. At the Best Western Plus Carpinteria Inn, several miles southeast of Montecito, a steady stream of people clad in rain gear pulled up in SUVs packed with luggage and provisions. Some who had evacuated said they were surprised to be among those ordered to leave because their homes were not in burn scars, areas hit by wildfire that are made more susceptible to landslides. In the 2018 storm that led to the devastating mudslide, officials had issued mandatory evacuation orders for about 7,000 residents in Montecito and voluntary ones for another 23,000, but many disregarded them because they had just returned home after being forced to leave during a wildfire.\n\nMontecito is a popular haven for celebrities, including Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex; Oprah Winfrey; and Ellen DeGeneres, who posted a video on Twitter of a raging creek behind her house that she said \u201cnever flows, ever.\u201d \u201cWe need to be nicer to Mother Nature because Mother Nature is not happy with us,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said. Evacuation orders were also in place in neighboring Ventura County, including in the tiny community of La Conchita, the site of a 2005 landslide around the same time of year that killed 10 people.\n\nIn Santa Cruz County, about 70 miles south of San Francisco, more than 30,000 residents were placed under evacuation orders as creeks and rivers topped their banks, threatened homes and washed away at least one bridge. Mudslides blocked two highways in the Santa Cruz Mountains that connect the region to the San Francisco Bay Area. The flooding in the county besieged an area already reeling from some of the heaviest damage from recent storms. Just last week, the confluence of a storm surge, high tides and high surf collapsed piers and flooded hundreds of homes and businesses. The storm\u2019s impacts continued farther south along the state\u2019s Central Coast, with evacuation orders along rivers in Watsonville and Monterey County.",

            "section": "Arts",
            "content": "Clockwise from left: Chico O'Farrill, Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo. The three musicians and their work pioneering Latin jazz are the focus of a concert in New York this week.\n\nA concert at Town Hall this week that will be led by Arturo O\u2019Farrill and the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra celebrates the legacies of Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo and Chico O\u2019Farrill.\n\nIn the fall of 1947, Dizzy Gillespie called on his friend, the trumpeter-arranger Mario Bauz\u00e1, in search of a conga player for an upcoming Carnegie Hall concert where he planned to debut songs exploring the connection between Afro-Cuban music and jazz. Bauz\u00e1 suggested Chano Pozo, a swaggering master of Yoruba rhythms, who had just arrived from Cuba. It was a wildly fortuitous introduction: Dizzy and Chano\u2019s team-up would mark a watershed moment in jazz history, what many refer to as the birth of Latin jazz. Although neither musician could communicate in the other\u2019s language, they shared a cultural connection, and suddenly bebop, Gillespie\u2019s rebellious jazz experiment, became Cubop. Arturo O\u2019Farrill, leader of the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, which he formed in 2001 for Jazz at Lincoln Center, has long contemplated that meeting. It was a collaboration that united African diasporas, north and south, reconstructing ties broken by the slave trade. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it,\u201d he said in a recent video interview, \u201cwhere Dizzy says, \u2018I don\u2019t speak Spanish and Chano doesn\u2019t speak English, but we both speak African.\u2019\u201d This Saturday at Town Hall, O\u2019Farrill will commemorate that moment, just over 75 years ago, when Dizzy and Chano bonded over their ancestral past and took the music into the future, as well as the role his father, Chico, played in that evolution. The concert, which pays tribute to \u201cThe Original Influencers,\u201d celebrates a Town Hall show similar to the Carnegie performance that took place in December 1947, and will feature O\u2019Farrill\u2019s 18-piece orchestra, as well as special guests Pedrito Mart\u00ednez on percussion, Jon Faddis on trumpet, Donald Harrison on saxophone, the singers Daym\u00e9 Arocena and Melvis Santa, and O\u2019Farrill\u2019s two sons, Adam and Zack, on trumpet and drums.\n\nThe Cuban-born Chico O\u2019Farrill was the son of Irish and German immigrants to the island and was so taken with the fusions previously explored by Bauz\u00e1 as musical director of Machito and His Afro-Cubans, that he convinced the impresario Norman Granz to commission and record his \u201cAfro-Cuban Jazz Suite,\u201d featuring Charlie Parker, Buddy Rich and Flip Phillips, in 1950. \u201cMy father was fully European, living in an African country \u2014 because, you know, Cuba\u2019s basically an African country \u2014 and also falling in love with jazz,\u201d O\u2019Farrill said. \u201cHe was the perfect person to be in all three worlds.\u201d The elder O\u2019Farrill joined up with Gillespie in the following years and became one of Latin jazz\u2019s chief arrangers and orchestra leaders. Gillespie became Faddis\u2019s mentor soon after he arrived in New York as an 18-year-old aspiring trumpeter. On Saturday, he will perform the \u201cManteca Suite,\u201d Chico\u2019s elaborate rearrangement of the Gillespie-Pozo classic written with Gil Fuller, \u201cManteca.\u201d Faddis\u2019s close association with Gillespie made him privy to Chico\u2019s relationship with Pozo, who was tragically murdered in Harlem in 1948.\n\nPozo clued in Gillespie\u2019s band to the dense polyrhythmic patterns that permeate the Afro-Cuban music that he learned as a street drummer in the Black Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Havana. In his autobiography \u201cTo Be, or Not \u2026 to Bop,\u201d Gillespie expressed a desire to recapture lost elements of African tradition, writing that he \u201calways had that Latin feeling\u201d but that his musical ancestors remained \u201cmonorhythmic,\u201d because drums were not tolerated by U.S. slave masters, while the Afro-Cubans \u201cremained polyrhythmic.\u201d Gillespie and Pozo shared other cultural bonds, too. \u201cI think when you hear Dizzy and Chano play the Afro Cuban Suite, you hear the pattern of call and response,\u201d Faddis added. \u201cOne of the main connectors between that Afro-Cuban lineage and American jazz is what you hear in the work songs, the prison songs and even the spirituals \u2014 the call and response in the church.\u201d Gillespie and Pozo\u2019s reunion of different diasporic African traditions through jazz had many antecedents, particularly in New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when King Oliver and Lorenzo Tio visited Havana with a military band and absorbed Cuban influences. The ragtime pianist Jellyroll Morton famously referenced \u201ctinges of Spanish\u201d in his playing, and in New York, Bauz\u00e1 had been steadily absorbing jazz techniques and sharing Cuban rhythmic tradition as musical director of the Chick Webb orchestra in the 1930s. Both Gillespie and Bauz\u00e1 had yearned to escape the predictability of danceable Latin ballroom and big band music, and in 1947, just as Gillespie was perfecting his notion of bebop, Pozo\u2019s intervention helped jazz became an international genre. It would put Gillespie on a path that defined the rest of his musical career. By 1988, Dizzy founded the United Nations Orchestra, which over the years featured Latin jazz stars like Paquito D\u2019Rivera, Giovanni Hidalgo, Arturo Sandoval, David S\u00e1nchez and Miguel Zen\u00f3n among many others. Pedrito Mart\u00ednez, who will be performing two songs from his 2013 self-titled debut at the Town Hall concert, is evidence of Cubop\u2019s internationalist legacy. He was inspired by Pozo, and even grew up in the same neighborhood in Havana. \u201cI learned to play rumba in the street, like Chano did,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said in an interview. \u201cHe was someone from the marginal world who didn\u2019t speak English, but he opened up doors for all of us.\u201d Mart\u00ednez had collaborated with Faddis in Steve Turre\u2019s \u201cSanctified Shells\u201d band, and had Faddis guest on his most recent album, \u201cAcertijos.\u201d He sees the connection between Afro-Cuban and jazz music as a kind of mystical fusion of spirit worlds. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of Thelonious Monk videos, and he looked like a rumbero,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said, referring to the way Monk would sometimes perform a spinning dance that suggested Yoruban dance and spirit possession. \u201cHe stood up to dance and played the piano with one hand and then the other. Jazz has a very spiritual connection to Afro-Cuban music, because it\u2019s a way of feeling, of giving reverence to the ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe rediscovery of common spiritual roots between African Americans and the Afro-Latin American diaspora is what keeps the Afro-Cuban jazz concept grounded and coherent. While there have been many debates about whether American jazz\u2019s melodic and harmonic traditions and Afro-Caribbean rhythmic techniques dominate, it\u2019s always been a back-and-forth conversation, an inter-hemispheric musical negotiation. It\u2019s no surprise that P\u00e9rez Prado and Tito Puente\u2019s mambo rose quickly in the wake of Gillespie and Pozo\u2019s Cubop, and that it\u2019s possible to hear Prado mambo elements in the early work of the Afro-futurist pioneer Sun Ra. What\u2019s clear is that there\u2019s no going back. \u201cThere are a lot of purists who want to keep jazz, jazz as jazz, they don\u2019t want to mess with it,\u201d O\u2019Farrill said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been fighting this battle for 30 years, and I\u2019m like, no, no, no. Jazz and Latin are the same trunk of the same tree. But it looks like we can never resolve this discussion. It can only go on and be explored to the end of time.\u201d \u201cDizzy, Chano and Chico: The Original Influencers, 75 Years Later at Town Hall,\u201d featuring Arturo O\u2019Farrill and the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, runs at Town Hall on Saturday at 8 p.m.; thetownhall.org.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAlong with the juicy tidbits Prince Harry offers up in his new memoir, there is also a revealing look at how the royal family, and its staff, operate behind closed doors.\n\nLONDON \u2014 Prince Harry\u2019s new memoir features an all-star cast of characters, from Granny (Queen Elizabeth II) to Pa (King Charles III) to Willy (Prince William). And then there\u2019s the mysterious trio of Bee, Wasp and Fly. Those are the nicknames Harry has given to three senior courtiers in the British royal household, who he said handled the tensest negotiations between him, his wife, Meghan, and the royal family, including the deal under which they withdrew from public duties and moved to Southern California in 2020. Harry never names the three officials, but he makes clear he blames them, almost as much as his father and brother, for failing to protect him and Meghan from a poisonous drip of negative stories in the London tabloids, which Harry said tormented the couple and precipitated their decision to break with the family. For all its juicy details about royal sexcapades, shoving matches and drug use, the book, titled \u201cSpare\u201d and released Tuesday after days of hyperventilating promotion, may be most intriguing for its revealing, if at times cryptic, look at how the institution of the monarchy operates behind closed doors. Amid all his sharing, Harry does not name, or uses nicknames for, many of those he is disparaging.\n\nBee, Wasp and Fly, in Harry\u2019s telling, are central to the operation \u2014 and to his jaundiced view of palace culture. They are at the apex of a sprawling hierarchy that he claims undermined him and his wife. It includes communications secretaries, ladies-in-waiting and a passel of junior aides who jockey on behalf of their royal bosses, sometimes to the detriment of other family members. \u201cI\u2019d spent my life dealing with courtiers, scores of them,\u201d Harry wrote. \u201cBut now I dealt mostly with just three, all middle-aged white men who\u2019d managed to consolidate power through a series of bold Machiavellian maneuvers.\u201d Two people with ties to Buckingham Palace identified the courtiers as Edward Young, who served as private secretary to the queen; Clive Alderton, the private secretary to Charles; and Simon Case, who was private secretary to William and is now the government\u2019s Cabinet Secretary, the highest post in the British civil service. The two people insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The release of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir, \u201cSpare,\u201d had been a hotly anticipated affair, with leaked passages and pre-publication interviews.\n\u2022 None Detailing a Royal Rift: The book paints a portrait of a hopelessly divided House of Windsor.

Here\u2019s a look at some of the world\u2019s other messy monarchies The palace, asked about the role of the three courtiers, declined to comment on employees, as it has withheld a response to anything in the book. The Cabinet Office also declined to comment when asked about Mr. Case. In the week since morsels from the book began leaking out, Harry has come under criticism from some quarters for reciting a litany of grievances and for violating his family\u2019s privacy, the same practice for which he has long condemned the tabloids.\n\nThat was a sentiment some customers expressed on Tuesday morning at a Waterstones bookstore in Piccadilly Circus as the book went on sale. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019ve gone the tabloid aspect of dishing dirt,\u201d said one customer, James Broadley. He added that he understood the financial motives behind it and was nevertheless considering buying the book. While Harry has unapologetically named close family members, he has avoided it in the case of some outside antagonists. For example, in the case of Rebekah Brooks, a former tabloid editor who runs Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News U.K., he turned her into \u201cRehabber Kooks.\u201d Harry filed a lawsuit in 2019 against Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Sun and other papers, saying it had hacked his phone. He referred to two especially persistent paparazzi as Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber. Another tabloid reporter is called the Thumb, so named for having written what Harry recalled as an overblown story about him breaking a bone in his thumb while playing rugby at Eton College. He cited a well-known 2013 essay in the London Review of Books by the historical novelist Hilary Mantel, in which she compared the royal family to pandas \u2014 \u201cexpensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment\u201d \u2014 but he did not identify either Ms. Mantel or the publication. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What\u2019s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. Harry is less shy about Mr. Murdoch himself, writing that his politics were \u201cjust to the right of the Taliban\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSara, a former communications secretary to Harry and Meghan, is Sara Latham, an American who once advised Hillary Clinton and later worked for the queen, planning her Platinum Jubilee (Buckingham Palace made Ms. Latham a lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order for services to the monarch). Lady Susan is Susan Hussey, who served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen for more than six decades. In the book, Harry wrote that he ran into her in the halls of Sandringham, the queen\u2019s country estate, when he excused himself from the meeting at which the terms of his exit were being hashed out. Ms. Hussey, 83, came to public attention recently when she was stripped of her duties and apologized after repeatedly asking a Black British guest at the palace where her family came from. In an interview with ITV on Sunday, Harry said he was glad Ms. Hussey had reconciled with the guest, Ngozi Fulani, and he seemed to defend her conduct.\n\nWhen it was time to pick an option, Harry said, one of the officials produced a paper copy of the most extreme one. When Harry asked whether he had printed out the other options, he wrote, the official said his printer had stalled. \u201cEveryone was staring away or down at their shoes,\u201d Harry wrote. Such a passive reaction from the queen and the next two people in line for the throne might seem surprising. But experts on the royal household said it accurately captures the wide latitude that private secretaries have, from setting agendas to brokering meetings, even with other family members. Private secretaries are often drawn from military or diplomatic ranks; some have had formidable jobs before going into royal service \u2014 or go on to big ones after it. Mr. Alderton, for example, was Britain\u2019s ambassador to Morocco before working for Charles; Mr. Case has since worked for three prime ministers. \u201cThe private secretaries run the place, basically,\u201d said Valentine Low, royal correspondent for the Times of London and the author of \u201cCourtiers: Intrigue, Ambition, and the Power Players Behind the House of Windsor.\u201d \u201cOn a banal level, they write their principals\u2019 speeches and organize their diaries,\u201d Mr. Valentine said. \u201cBut they run their lives. They\u2019re their gatekeepers. They\u2019re kind of joined at the hip.\u201d",

For teenagers, that\u2019s created a deluge of sexually explicit photos and videos that has invaded their everyday lives, according to a report released on Tuesday. Three-quarters of teenagers have viewed pornography online by the age of 17, with the average age of first exposure at age 12, according to the report by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit child advocacy group. Teenagers are seeing the photos and videos on their smartphones, on their school devices and across social media, pornography sites and streaming sites, it said. The report underlined how ubiquitous pornography has become, with 41 percent of teenagers saying they had seen images of nudity or sexual acts online during the school day. Much of the exposure was by accident, with 58 percent saying they did not seek out the sexually explicit videos and photos, but had come across them while surfing the web, on social media or through search engines or clicking ads.\n\nTeenagers have increasingly grappled with the role of technology on their mental health and well-being. In recent years, lawmakers have criticized social media platforms like Instagram for exacerbating eating disorders and scrutinized how the sites have been used to sell illegal substances such as fentanyl-laced drugs to adolescents. The effect of online pornography on teenagers has been less examined, but parents and politicians have been locked in fierce debates over tech safety and whether discussions around pornography should take place in schools or at home. Last fall, sex education courses in Idaho were falsely portrayed in posts and an article as promoting pornography. Tweets linking to the false report provoked outrage online and were mentioned on Fox News. In Louisiana, a new law will require age verification for pornography sites. \u201cWe can\u2019t sweep this topic under the rug just because it\u2019s uncomfortable to talk about,\u201d said Jim Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, who plans to present the report this week to officials at the White House and at federal agencies. \u201cPornography is a huge part of the lives of children who have digital access like never before, and we need to have a national conversation about it.\u201d Part of the issue is that online pornography is a highly lucrative industry, giving it a firm foothold. While there is little data on the size of the online pornography industry, one estimate from Alec Helmy, the founder of the trade publication XBIZ, which surveys payment processors, puts revenues for adult influencers and platforms at at least $15 billion in 2022. He estimated revenues from internet pornography in 2012 were $5 billion. In recent years, online pornography has evolved into a business in which thousands of people have their own streaming, texting and photo channels that are promoted on sites like Instagram and hosted on platforms like OnlyFans and PornHub, Mr. Helmy said.\n\nCommon Sense\u2019s report was based on a survey in September of 1,358 Americans ages 13 to 17. More than half said they had viewed pornography of violent acts such as rape, choking or someone in pain. A majority said the pornography portrayed stereotypes of Black, Latino and Asian people. More than half said they felt guilty or ashamed after watching porn. At the same time, 45 percent said the pornography provided helpful information about sex. L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers, in particular, said it helped them discover more about their sexuality. \u201cWe have to be careful about saying all porn is good or bad,\u201d said Emily Rothman, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University. \u201cThere is nuance here.\u201d Schools, parents and political leaders have been at odds on how to handle the topic. David Miyashiro, the superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District in the San Diego area, said he had held tech and safety workshops and discussions for parents but had not directly addressed pornography in any of those sessions. The Middle Eastern refugee community and conservative Christians have expressed discomfort with the district\u2019s conducting any sex education, he said. The devices that students are issued to take home have filtering software, he said, that runs through district servers to block access to pornography sites and to alert school officials of searches for explicit and harmful content. \u201cSexual health and sex ed are areas that are very family specific,\u201d Mr. Miyashiro said. \u201cA wide-sweeping policy or stance will sometimes isolate people and can create enemies or friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis generation of parents are dealing with things that no other generation has had to deal with \u2014 the amount of access to information in the hands of kids,\u201d Dr. Viramontez said. In the Common Sense survey, teenagers said much of the content they saw was disturbing. Only one in three said the pornography included someone asking for consent before engaging in sexual activity. Fewer than half said they discussed pornography with a trusted adult. Of those who did, the conversation \u201cencouraged them to think about ways to explore sex or sexuality other than porn,\u201d according to the report. Teenagers who intentionally sought pornography said their top sources were sites like PornHub and YouPorn. Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit and other social media sites ranked second as sources for pornography. Instagram, Snap and TikTok ban sexually explicit material. But the sites have been used for promotions that link to pornography sites. They also bar individuals from directing users to pornography on other platforms. In December, YouTube banned PornHub\u2019s channel for repeatedly violating its policy that forbids links to websites that violate YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, such as pornography. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has a similar ban on outside links and said its algorithms were designed to limit the spread of sexually explicit content. A YouTube spokesperson said its policy was to \u201cstrictly prohibit the posting of explicit content, such as pornography, that is intended to be sexually gratifying on our platform.\u201d Meta said Facebook and Instagram had controls that automatically made it harder for teenagers to search for and find sexually suggestive content.",

And for the past 10 weeks, the protesters faced little resistance from the government. Then, on Sunday, many of the camp\u2019s inhabitants left their tents in Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, drove a few miles away and, joining hundreds of other protesters, stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential offices. By Monday morning, the authorities were sweeping through the encampment. They dismantled tents, tore down banners and detained 1,200 of the protesters, ferrying them away in buses for questioning.\n\nBrazil\u2019s justice minister, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, said various security agencies had met on Friday to plan for possible violence in the planned protests on Sunday. But, he said, the security strategy hatched in that meeting, including keeping protesters away from the main government buildings, was at least partly abandoned on Sunday and there were far fewer law enforcement officers than had been anticipated. \u201cThe police contingent was not what had been agreed upon,\u201d he said, adding that it was unclear why plans had changed. Some in the federal government blamed the governor of Bras\u00edlia, Ibaneis Rocha, and his deputies, suggesting that they had been either negligent or complicit in understaffing the security forces around the protests. Late Sunday, Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice, suspended Mr. Rocha from his job as governor for at least 90 days, saying that the upheaval \u201ccould only occur with the consent, and even effective participation, of the security and intelligence authorities.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters have been repeating the claims for months, and then built on them with new conspiracy theories passed along in group chats on WhatsApp and Telegram, many focused on the idea that the electronic voting machines\u2019 software was manipulated to steal the election. On Sunday, protesters stood on the roof of Congress with a banner that made a single demand: \u201cWe want the source code.\u201d Thousands of rioters supporting Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president of Brazil, stormed the nation\u2019s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices on Jan. 8.\n\u2022 None Anatomy of a Mass Attack: After Mr. Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October, many believed that the threat of violence from his supporters would recede.

Walking out of the protest encampment on Monday morning, Orlando Pinheiro Farias, 40, said he had entered the presidential offices on Sunday with fellow protesters to find documents related to \u201cthe investigations into the source code, which legitimize that Jair Messias Bolsonaro is the president of Brazil.\u201d He rattled off several government acronyms and secret investigations that he had read about on the internet, and then said that he had to go back to his tent to retrieve a Brazilian flag he had stolen from the building.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of the Trojan Horse?\u201d said Nathanael S. Viera, 51, who had driven 900 miles to take part in the protests on Sunday. \u201cThe infiltrators went in and set everything up, and the damn press showed the Brazilian nation that we patriots are the hooligans.\u201d The scenes on Sunday of right-wing protesters draped in their national flag roaming through the halls of power were strikingly similar to those from the Jan. 6 storming of the United States Capitol, and so were the confused beliefs that drove protesters in both countries to invade federal buildings and film themselves doing so. \u201cDonald Trump was taken out with a rigged election, no question about it, and at the time he was taken out, I said, \u2018President Bolsonaro is going to be taken down,\u2019\u201d said Wanderlei Silva, 59, a retired hotel worker standing outside the encampment on Monday. Mr. Silva saw his own similarities between the riots on Sunday and those on Jan. 6, 2021. \u201cThe Democrats staged that and invaded the Capitol,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same way they staged it here.\u201d Brazil has long seen itself in the mold of the United States: a sprawling, diverse country rich in natural resources, spread across a collection of independent states and governed by a strong central government. But its tumultuous political history never truly mimicked the American system, until the past several years.\n\n\u201cIf there was no Trump, there would be no Bolsonaro in Brazil. And if there was no invasion of the Capitol, there wouldn\u2019t have been the invasion we saw yesterday,\u201d said Guga Chacra, a commentator for Brazil\u2019s largest television network, who lives in New York and tracks politics in both countries. \u201cBolsonarismo tries to copy Trumpism, and Bolsonaro supporters in Brazil try to copy what Trump supporters do in the United States.\u201d Even a description of Brazil\u2019s 2022 presidential election reads like a summary of the 2020 American one: a far-right populist incumbent with a penchant for insults and off-the-cuff tweets against a septuagenarian challenger on the left running on his proven political track record and a promise to unite a divided nation.\n\nBut the election\u2019s aftermath was different. While former President Donald J. Trump fought to overturn the results and urged his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, Mr. Bolsonaro had effectively given up and decamped for Florida by the time his voters were forcing their way into the offices he once occupied. Mr. Bolsonaro spent part of Monday in the hospital in Florida, dealing with abdominal pains stemming from a stabbing he suffered in 2018, his wife said on social media. Mr. Bolsonaro is planning to stay in Florida for the next several weeks or months, hoping investigations in Brazil into his activity as president will cool off, according to a friend. Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, would not comment specifically on Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s visa status, citing privacy laws. But he said that any person who came to the United States under a diplomatic visa and who \u201cis no longer engaged in official business on behalf of their government\u201d was expected either to depart the country or request a different type of visa within 30 days. \u201cIf an individual has no basis on which to be in the United States, an individual is subject to removal,\u201d Mr. Price said.\n\nMr. Lula, the new president, is a leftist but is not a communist. And independent security experts said there was no evidence of irregularities in the 2022 vote. A separate analysis by Brazil\u2019s military found just one potential vulnerability in Brazil\u2019s fully digital voting system, which would require the coordination of multiple election officials to exploit, a scenario that security experts said was extremely unlikely. Mr. Lula, who had campaigned on unifying the divided nation, is now faced with investigating and prosecuting many of his political opponents\u2019 supporters just a week into his presidency. The authorities said that roughly 1,500 protesters had been detained by Monday evening, and that they would be held until at least the investigation was finished. On Monday, Mr. Lula spoke with President Biden, who conveyed \u201cthe unwavering support of the United States for Brazil\u2019s democracy and for the free will of the Brazilian people,\u201d White House officials said. Mr. Biden invited Mr. Lula to the White House in early February. (It took more than 18 months for him to meet with Mr. Bolsonaro at a summit in Los Angeles.)\n\n\n\nIn a televised speech on Monday night, Mr. Lula said that his government would prosecute anyone who had attacked Brazil\u2019s democracy on Sunday. \u201cWhat they want is a coup, and they won\u2019t have one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to learn that democracy is the most complicated thing we do.\u201d He and many of Brazil\u2019s top government officials then walked together from the presidential offices to the Supreme Court, crossing the same plaza that a day before was thronged with mobs calling for the overthrow of his government.",

            "content": "To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. Early last October, Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, spoke to several dozen graduate students at the University of Minnesota. Federal Reserve officials tend to choose their words with exquisite care. One misstatement or clumsy phrase, even before an audience dressed in shorts and flip-flops, can spook the financial markets. With the Fed, the nation\u2019s central bank, rapidly raising interest rates to combat the highest inflation that the United States had experienced in four decades, Wall Street was especially skittish. But there was little chance of Kashkari\u2019s committing a gaffe: He was a skilled public speaker, an ability that he honed during a failed campaign for governor in California in 2014. He also had a politician\u2019s knack for using easy-to-understand anecdotes to illustrate complicated ideas. Kashkari was wearing an N95 mask as he walked into the auditorium that evening; his wife and one of his children had Covid-19, and though he tested negative earlier in the day, he wanted to be cautious around others. The mask, which he removed when he took his seat at the front of the room, was a reminder that the pandemic was still disrupting workplaces and daily life. Kashkari, who is 49, carried with him a bottle of Cherry Coke Zero. He drinks soda throughout the day and seldom goes anywhere without a bottle in hand. But the Cherry Coke Zero was also a way into the story that he wanted to share \u2014 about inflation, which began spiking in the first quarter of 2021 and was running at around 8 percent year-over-year. Kashkari told the audience that he often stocked up on soda at a service station near his daughter\u2019s school. The store had recently installed Cooler Screens, digital displays that, among other things, showed which drinks were available and what they cost. Curious, Kashkari asked about the screens. The store\u2019s manager told him that they were installed to make it easier to update prices; instead of doing it manually, employees could now do it with a push of a button. Those Cooler Screens, Kashkari said, were a window into the current economy: Prices were rising quickly and unpredictably, and merchants, stretched for workers because of a very tight labor market, were having to adjust how they operated in order to keep pace, a sign that inflation was possibly becoming more deeply rooted. \u201cThat was a punch in the gut at 8 in the morning,\u201d Kashkari said, drawing laughter from the students. Zooming out, Kashkari explained that the Fed had initially thought that the rise in inflation would be temporary. And it was conceivable that inflation might have eased on its own: Covid had disrupted global supply chains and had also created excess consumer demand, and perhaps, over time, things would have come back into balance on their own. But unchecked inflation can be ruinous, and Kashkari said that for the Fed, the question became, \u201cHow much are we willing to roll the dice?\u201d The central bank was now aggressively increasing interest rates to bring inflation back to around 2 percent, its long-established target. If the Fed failed to get inflation lower, it would damage its credibility and sow doubts about its ability to guide the economy. \u201cWe at least need to walk the walk,\u201d Kashkari said.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d underscored an essential point about the Fed. When the Fed is in the news \u2014 and it has been in the headlines a lot lately \u2014 the focus is inevitably on the central bank\u2019s chair. That was the case under Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, and it is also true under the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell. The effort to rein in inflation is seen as a test of his leadership and a battle that will go a long way to determining his legacy. Monetary policy, though, is made by a committee that includes the Fed\u2019s chair, the six other members of its board of governors and the presidents of the 12 regional banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System. Kashkari, now in his eighth year at the Minneapolis Fed, has assumed an unusually high profile for a regional Fed president, and he brings an interesting r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the fight against inflation. If Kashkari\u2019s name sounds vaguely familiar, it should: As a Treasury Department official during the 2007-9 global financial crisis, he administered the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, through which the government propped up banks and other institutions to prevent them from going under. The $700 billion bailout was deeply controversial, and much of the ire was directed at Kashkari, who had previously worked for Goldman Sachs. An ex-banker throwing a lifeline to bankers was a bad look, to put it gently, and Kashkari was pilloried in the press and on Capitol Hill. As Kashkari tells it, the financial meltdown shook his faith in the self-correcting powers of capitalism and also prompted him to reflect more deeply on the inequities of the American economy. He arrived in Minneapolis as a chastened free-marketer who thought the Fed could play a bigger role in pushing for a more just economy. To that end, he helped put the Minneapolis Fed at the center of discussions about the economic consequences of racism and other social ills. He also staked out a position as an ardent dove. In Fed-speak, doves prefer looser monetary policy to maximize employment (lower interest rates stimulate growth, which leads to more hiring) while hawks favor tighter credit to keep inflation down. When it became evident to him in late 2021 that inflationary pressures were not abating, Kashkari changed course and joined the hawks. Several other Fed officials did likewise (\u201cThere are no doves in foxholes\u201d is a quip I heard a few times in recent months, and apparently what passes for central-bank humor). Kashkari embraced his newfound hawkishness with the zeal of a convert, becoming stridently hard-line in his public comments. His about-face has surprised former admirers who were encouraged by his effort to get the Fed to embrace a broader conception of its own mandate and who worry that the central bank has raised rates too abruptly. Kashkari insists that he hasn\u2019t wavered in his desire to promote a fairer economy but that taming inflation must be the priority. \u201cThe sooner we take the medicine,\u201d he says, \u201cthe less painful it will be.\u201d The medicine appears to be working \u2014 inflation is moderating, and some economists think that we have seen the worst of it. Wage growth remains strong, though, and until that changes, it is going to be very difficult if not impossible for the Fed to get inflation back to 2 percent. The Fed insists that its target rate is inviolable; it raised interest rates again last month and indicated that more increases are likely. There\u2019s a good chance that the Fed could push the economy into recession. As former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers put it when we spoke recently, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop a car on ice without skidding.\u201d If there is a recession, the pain will probably be felt most acutely by those on the margins \u2014 the very people that Kashkari was eager to help. In a sense, Kashkari has come to embody the harsh trade-offs at the heart of the battle against inflation.\n\nWhen Paul Volcker died three years ago at age 92, he was widely remembered as the savior of the American economy. The imposingly tall, cigar-chomping Volcker was the Fed\u2019s chairman from 1979 to 1987. At the time of his appointment by President Jimmy Carter, the United States was reeling from years of high inflation, high unemployment and sluggish growth. \u201cStagflation\u201d was the word coined to describe this miserable triad. Two years before Volcker was named Fed chair, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Reform Act, which decreed that the central bank had two primary tasks: keeping prices stable and promoting maximum employment \u2014 what has come to be known as the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate.\u201d In the late 1970s, the Fed was failing at both. Volcker believed that curbing inflation was the necessary prerequisite for a return to economic health. Inflation is the rate at which prices increase over a given period of time. When it is persistently high \u2014 and it was around 12 percent annually when Volcker took office \u2014 it erodes the purchasing power of consumers; their money is worth less and less. Under Volcker, the Fed raised interest rates to 20 percent and tipped the economy into recession twice \u2014 once in early 1980, and again the following year (loosely defined, a recession is when the economy contracts for an extended period). But the draconian measures worked: By 1983, inflation had plummeted to around 4 percent, unemployment was coming down and the economy was recovering. In economic and financial circles, Volcker became a sainted figure, credited with laying the foundation for decades of low inflation, relatively stable growth and rising \u2014 if unevenly distributed \u2014 prosperity. The pandemic roused inflation from its long slumber. After Covid hit, millions of Americans were stuck at home, and thanks to the booming stock market and stimulus checks sent out by the government, many of them were awash in savings. Unable to travel or dine out, people spent money on things. At the same time, the pandemic had wreaked havoc on supply lines, and many products were no longer reaching warehouses and retail shelves or were arriving in greatly reduced quantities. Too much money was chasing too few goods, and a result was an outbreak of high inflation. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last winter pushed up food and energy prices, compounding the problem, and the Fed has been scrambling to get inflation under control ever since. (The economist Mohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, and a leading voice in the debate over inflation, told me that the central bank\u2019s belated response to surging prices was \u201cone of the biggest Fed policy mistakes ever.\u201d) The Fed\u2019s main inflation-fighting tool is its ability to move interest rates. Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. When the Fed lowers rates, it is trying to spur the economy; raising rates is meant to slow the economy. The Fed implements monetary policy through one particular interest rate, the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge one another for overnight lending. Think of it as a tiller the Fed uses to help steer the economy. When the Fed Funds Rate goes up, other borrowing costs go up. The Fed has sharply increased the Fed Funds Rate in the last year, and as a consequence, rates for 30-year mortgages have more than doubled (which is one reason home sales have been declining).\n\nBut there are also some crucial differences. For one thing, interest rates were much higher under Volcker. When the central bank started raising interest rates last March, the Fed Funds Rate was effectively zero. In addition, when Volcker became Fed chair, inflation was already embedded in the economy, a point underscored by a button that President Gerald Ford wore on his lapel that read \u201cWIN,\u201d which stood for \u201cWhip Inflation Now.\u201d By contrast, the current outbreak is relatively recent, and the public \u2014 so far, at least \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem to be treating it as permanent. That\u2019s important, because fighting inflation is in no small part a battle against the psychology of inflation; the Fed has been raising interest rates not just to dampen price pressures but also to keep inflation expectations from becoming \u201cunanchored\u201d \u2014 more Fed-speak, for when people come to believe that high inflation is here to stay, which can turn into a self-fulfilling dynamic. Kashkari\u2019s encounter with the Cooler Screens was the sort of thing that could unnerve a central banker worried about an inflationary mind-set taking root. That happened in the 1970s, and it could happen again, but we are not there yet. Another major difference: The U.S. economy was moribund when Volcker was appointed Fed chair, but that is emphatically not the situation today. While inflation is high, other benchmarks suggest an economy in reasonably good shape. As of December, unemployment was 3.7 percent, a near-record low. Despite inflation, planes and restaurants and stores have been full. The economy shrank in the first two quarters of 2022, which by some definitions meant that the United States was in a recession. Yet, the economy was also adding jobs during this period. A contracting economy is supposed to shed jobs, not gain them. So was that a recession? It didn\u2019t feel like one. In the third quarter, the economy started growing again \u2014 gross domestic product, or G.D.P., was up 3.2 percent \u2014 even though the Fed had, by that point, raised interest rates multiple times. The pandemic has been a disorienting experience, and it has yielded a peculiar post-pandemic economy. \u201cThis is the most confusing economy I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime,\u201d says the Harvard economist Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. \u2018The sooner we take the medicine,\u2019 Kashkari says, \u2018the less painful it will be.\u2019 The Fed has acted with notable certitude in the face of all this murkiness. In one of several conversations that we had in recent months, Kashkari agreed that it was difficult to make sense of the economy: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the signals so mixed.\u201d He went on to say, however, that the inflation data was unambiguous and that the Fed, having learned from Volcker\u2019s example, had moved with appropriate haste and firepower. \u201cWe know how to deal with high inflation,\u201d he said. But it can take a while for rate hikes to filter through the economy, and no one has any idea yet if the Fed has done too much, too little or just enough. The answer will have enormous implications not just for the economy, but perhaps also for President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election prospects should he decide to run again. In 2006, Henry Paulson, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed U.S. Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush. At the time, Kashkari was an investment banker for Goldman in San Francisco. He joined the firm four years earlier, after earning an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business (he also held undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois and previously worked on the James Webb Space Telescope). When Paulson was named Treasury secretary, Kashkari left him a phone message expressing a desire to join his team in Washington. After first working on issues involving alternative energy, Kashkari was asked by Paulson to look at the housing market, which following a long run-up was suddenly tanking. The housing collapse triggered a financial crisis that took down two investment banks, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. When Lehman fell, Kashkari recalls, it was a \u201cbreak-the-glass moment.\u201d The Treasury Department, working with the Federal Reserve, came up with a $700 billion rescue package, and Kashkari was put in charge of it. He was a controversial choice: He was just 35, which seemed insultingly young, and a Goldman alum, no less. The press dubbed him \u201cthe $700 Billion Man\u201d and \u201cFerrari Kashkari.\u201d\n\nIt can be argued that TARP worked, or at least didn\u2019t fail: The financial system recovered, the program ended up costing less than initially projected and, as Kashkari likes to point out, the government ended up making a profit on the bailout of the banks. But it was wildly unpopular: While millions of Americans lost their homes and savings, the Wall Streeters who crashed the economy were rescued from their own greed and folly. Even though he became an object of scorn, Kashkari says he understands the rage that people felt: The bailout was antithetical to the spirit of capitalism, and as he puts it, \u201cWhen you violate the core beliefs of a society, I think it leads to great anger.\u201d The anger was exacerbated when none of the major culprits faced any legal reckoning. Kashkari says that TARP was necessary to save the economy but helped fuel the populist backlash that has destabilized our politics. The 2007-9 crisis also prompted a change in how he thought about the world. Growing up in Akron, Ohio, he was the Alex Keaton of his household: While the rest of the family was politically liberal, he was a Ronald Reagan fanboy, drawn to the rugged individualism that Reagan championed. When Kashkari arrived in Washington years later, he was something of a free-market purist. The financial upheaval shattered his belief in unfettered capitalism. He now realized that \u201ccapitalism can get things, big things, really wrong\u201d and that \u201cit was important to have robust regulations to protect against the gravest risks.\u201d After leaving the Treasury Department in May 2009, Kashkari retreated to the Sierra Nevada, where he lived in a cabin, chopped down trees and helped Paulson write his memoirs. After his sojourn in the woods, he took a job with Pimco, a bond-trading firm in Newport Beach, Calif. But it was a restive period for Kashkari; the work didn\u2019t enthrall him, and he was going through a divorce (he has since remarried and is the father of two young children). He eventually decided that, despite all the criticism and ridicule he faced because of TARP, he wanted to return to public service. In 2014, he won the Republican nomination for governor of California and faced the incumbent, Jerry Brown, in the general election. Kashkari ran a spirited, quixotic campaign \u2014 he spent a week living as a homeless person in Fresno \u2014 but was trounced by Brown, who won with 60 percent of the vote. The following year, he was approached by an executive search firm that was helping the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis find a new president. The Minneapolis Fed is part of a network of regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve System, which was created in 1913 and which is almost as complicated as the economy it helps manage. The Fed\u2019s seven governors are based in Washington and are federal employees. All of them are nominated by the president and subject to Senate confirmation. The regional Fed banks are quasi-public \u2014 they were established by Congress but operate as private corporations and are owned collectively by banks in the areas they serve. Though the regional Feds all have boards that choose their presidents, every regional Fed president must be approved by the Fed\u2019s governors. They then serve five-year terms. Kashkari might have seemed an unlikely candidate to lead the Minneapolis Fed. He had no connection to the district that it represents, which includes Minnesota, Montana, the Dakotas, parts of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. In addition, he was not an economist; Fed officials are not required to be economists, but his five most recent predecessors at the Minneapolis Fed were. (Jerome Powell is not an economist, either, but he was a Fed governor for nearly six years before being promoted to chairman in 2018.) Kashkari\u2019s run for governor figured to be another strike against him. The Fed zealously guards its independence from the elected branches and is sensitive to anything that suggests politicization. Kashkari feared that his foray into electoral politics would be a deal-breaker. That turned out not to be the case: The Minneapolis Fed was looking for someone with policymaking and management experience, as well as a dash of charisma, and Kashkari was hired. He insists that he didn\u2019t view the job as a chance for redemption, or as an opportunity to rehabilitate his image. But in the years since the financial crisis, he had grown increasingly troubled by issues like the racial wealth gap, and he believed that the Federal Reserve was uniquely positioned to shine a spotlight on them. It had not been overrun by partisanship and could objectively examine economic disparities in a way that Congress, say, could not. And Kashkari wanted the Minneapolis Fed to be at the forefront of this effort. For many years, the Minneapolis Fed was a lodestar of what was known colloquially as \u201cfreshwater\u201d economics, so named because it grew out of several universities in the Great Lakes region. In crudest terms, the freshwater camp believed that the economy could usually heal itself and that government intervention was generally unhelpful. This extended to the Fed and monetary policy: The freshwater view was that the central bank\u2019s main job was to control inflation, and its adherents frowned on the idea of using interest rates to try to jump-start an ailing economy or \u2014 worse still \u2014 to boost employment. The global financial crisis, a cataclysmic market failure, was seen by many observers as a death blow for the freshwater school. That Kashkari, of all people, ended up at the Minneapolis Fed, of all places, was an intriguing coda to the events of 2007-9.\n\nBut the \u201cfreshwater\u201d label obscured a larger truth about the Minneapolis Fed: Ideological predilections aside, it was known to produce lots of deeply insightful research. That was also the case at other regional banks, which highlights an important fact about the Fed, which is that in addition to its policymaking function, it is one of the world\u2019s premier economic research institutions. Hundreds of economists are employed throughout the Federal Reserve System, and they turn out vast amounts of expert analysis. As Kashkari saw it, the Fed had the resources to examine economic disparities in a granular way. He also wanted the central bank to take a somewhat broader view of its own role, which historically had \u201cleaned to the narrow side,\u201d as he puts it. How the nation\u2019s wealth is allocated is ultimately up to the voters and their elected representatives. Still, he believed that the Fed\u2019s research could do more to advance economic justice. In 2017, to study issues around inequality, Kashkari established an in-house think tank at the Minneapolis Fed called the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute. It is run by Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist who joined the Minneapolis Fed from the University of Notre Dame. Wozniak told me that she took the job because she wanted to be closer to the policymaking process and was also drawn to Kashkari\u2019s boundary-pushing vision. She says that Kashkari thought the Fed should be \u201cresponsive to the new realities\u201d of American economic life. The institute holds twice-yearly conferences and features a steady flow of research on issues at the intersection of race, gender, class, public health, education and economics. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, which took place in Minneapolis, Kashkari helped spearhead a series of virtual conferences, involving all 12 regional Fed bank presidents, on racism and the economy. The discussions covered a range of subtopics, including health care, financial services, housing, entrepreneurship, education and even the dearth of Black representation in the economics profession. While the series grew out of the outrage caused by Floyd\u2019s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, it also called attention to a serious economic problem: Racial discrimination was a huge drag on the economy. A Citigroup study, released that same year, estimated that the United States economy could have added another $16 trillion if gaps in critical areas like wages, health care and education had been closed for Black Americans in 2000. The emergence of what appeared to be a kinder, softer Fed drew criticism. Kashkari has been unusually outspoken for a regional Fed president. The heads of the regional Fed banks tend to make news only when they comment on the economy or have been accused of ethical lapses. (The presidents of the Boston and Dallas Fed banks both stepped down in 2021 after questions were raised about investments they had made, though both have maintained that they abided by the Fed\u2019s ethics rules.) But Kashkari didn\u2019t feel handcuffed by institutional reticence. Speaking of the role of regional Fed presidents, he said, \u201cYes, they\u2019re typically sleepy jobs, but opportunities are what you make of them.\u201d Kashkari has not been shy about using his platform as a bully pulpit. For instance, he bluntly tells audiences in his largely rural district that immigration is the only way their small communities are likely to thrive. But Kashkari has also pushed the limits of what Fed officials can say and do. Following Floyd\u2019s death, he tweeted that it was clear to him that the Minneapolis police officers had been \u201ctrained to use deadly force against Black men\u201d and that the murder was symptomatic of \u201cinstitutional racism that is actively taught and reinforced.\u201d At one conference on racism and the economy, which took place the week after the Jan. 6 insurrection, Kashkari, commenting on the violence in Washington, said that \u201cif those were Black militants, armed militants, storming the U.S. Capitol, I think they\u2019d all be dead right now. And so that is the most stark example of racism and disparities in our society.\u201d These were unusually provocative remarks coming from a Fed official. In 2020, Kashkari teamed up with Alan Page, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and retired associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, to propose an amendment to the state Constitution that would create a fundamental and civil right to a quality public education for every Minnesota schoolchild. Kashkari then spoke to lawmakers on behalf of the so-called Page Amendment. He justified his advocacy by linking it to the Fed\u2019s goal of maximizing employment \u2014 more people with good educations would presumably make for a stronger work force. But his involvement in what was clearly a political matter caused consternation among other Fed officials, who viewed it as inappropriate. (The Page Amendment is opposed by the state teachers\u2019 union, which claims it is too vague and could be used by pro-voucher groups to undermine public education, and the Legislature has declined to take it up.)\n\nIn keeping with his belief that the Fed could do more to address shortcomings in the economy, Kashkari was until recently probably the most dovish figure at the central bank. In 2017, the Fed raised interest rates three times; he voted against all three increases, because he didn\u2019t see inflation as an imminent threat and believed that the job market, while relatively strong, could be better. But while Kashkari was a dissenting voice then, within a few years it seemed that the Fed as a whole was becoming more dovish. In August 2020, it updated its approach to fulfilling its employment mandate; the Fed said its objective now was job growth that was \u201cbroad-based and inclusive,\u201d which was taken to mean growth that helped reduce racial employment disparities. (By all accounts, Kashkari was not the driving force behind this change \u2014 it was Fed officials in Washington, led by Jerome Powell.) The emergence of what appeared to be a kinder, softer Fed drew criticism. Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, accused the central bank of \u201cwoke mission creep.\u201d (Toomey, who recently left the Senate, declined to be interviewed for this article.) In a talk that he gave in October 2021, Larry Summers suggested that the Fed had failed to keep inflation in check because \u201cwe have a generation of central bankers who are defining themselves by their \u2018wokeness.\u2019 They\u2019re defining themselves by how socially concerned they are.\u201d When I spoke to Summers last fall, he clarified his remarks: He thought it was fine for the Fed to consider inequality and racism in its analyses, but when he made those comments, it seemed to him that the Fed had lost \u201csome of the rigor\u201d that normally guided its policymaking and had perhaps also wavered in its commitment to \u201cdoing hard things when necessary.\u201d (He thinks, though, that the Fed has atoned for its initial blunder and is doing what is needed to bring inflation under control.)

Now, it\u2019s going to Inflation is taking a bigger and bigger bite out of your wallet. Now, it\u2019s going to affect the size of your paycheck in 2023 Kashkari denies that the Fed was distracted by social issues; the central bank simply erred in thinking that high inflation would be temporary. But he admits that the Fed was reluctant to intervene when inflation jumped in early 2021: The economy was just starting to recover from its pandemic-induced coma, and he and his colleagues wanted to see if it would return to the low-inflation, modest-growth equilibrium that prevailed before Covid. \u201cIt seems reasonable to me that we would take a few months to study this before declaring, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re in a whole new world,\u2019\u201d Kashkari says. It is obvious now that the Fed should have raised interest rates sooner. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight,\u201d Kashkari says, \u201cdo I wish we would have started to tighten policy earlier? Absolutely.\u201d Still, he insists that it was only in late 2021 that it became unambiguously clear to him that rising inflation was not a blip. Once he realized this, he pivoted and decided that rate hikes were required. Kashkari suggests that his previous dovishness has given him added credibility in making the case for the Fed\u2019s current course of action \u2014 that if even Neel Kashkari felt that the Fed had to go on a war footing against inflation, it must be so. \u201cI think I can play a pretty unique role here,\u201d he told me.\n\nBefore discussing monetary policy with Spriggs, Kashkari asked him how concerned A.F.L.-C.I.O. members were about inflation. Spriggs said it broke down along racial lines; internal polling indicated that inflation was the primary economic concern of white A.F.L.-C.I.O. members but barely registered among African American members. He attributed the difference to what he called \u201cthe Fox News effect\u201d \u2014 whites were more apt to get their news from Fox, which was devoting a lot of airtime to inflation in the run-up to the midterm elections. \u201cBlack people don\u2019t watch Fox News,\u201d Spriggs said. Turning to the Fed, Spriggs said that higher interest rates were not going to solve what he believed was still the underlying source of inflation, supply-chain interruptions caused by the pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. The rate-tightening was very likely, though, to send the economy into recession and cause a jump in unemployment, particularly among low-wage workers, for whom losing a job is often catastrophic. \u201cIf you become unemployed,\u201d Spriggs said, \u201cthen all bets are off, because you can\u2019t afford anything.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no period in which the Fed pursued a deflationary policy in which low-income people won. The median income of Black families falls, and it takes years to come back. Child poverty spikes.\u201d \u2018If you are living paycheck to paycheck, yes, higher inflation hurts, but no paycheck hurts a lot more,\u2019 a former Fed economist says. Kashkari listened intently and didn\u2019t push back except when Spriggs said that unemployment insurance at the state level would offer scant relief to laid-off workers. Kashkari interjected to say that the system had been overwhelmed by the enormous job losses during the first months of the pandemic but that \u201cif we have a normal recession, it should be within the capacity of the states to handle it.\u201d Spriggs said that a number of states had decided that they were too generous during Covid and had reduced eligibility and cut benefits. Likewise, there was little political will in Washington to cushion the blow for victims of a recession. While the conversation didn\u2019t cause Kashkari to rethink his support for what the Fed was doing, it was a bracing reminder that the battle against inflation was potentially undermining the central bank\u2019s pursuit of more equitable job growth \u2014 an effort that was paying off. After soaring to nearly 17 percent during the first months of the pandemic, joblessness among African Americans has fallen to under 6 percent, a near-record low. African Americans have experienced their strongest wage growth ever. But these gains may be in jeopardy because of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate increases. Normally, unemployment among African Americans is almost twice what it is for their white counterparts, so if the overall jobless rate rises above, say, 5 percent, the rate for African Americans could very well be back in the double digits. Most economists think that the Fed has had no choice but to move forcefully against inflation. \u201cThe biggest sin any central bank can commit is to allow inflation to become entrenched,\u201d says Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG US. And Kashkari himself sees no contradiction between his present hawkishness and his desire for a more equitable economy. He claims that bringing inflation down will benefit all Americans, but especially low-wage workers, who have a much harder time coping with spiraling prices. Higher interest rates may cause a recession and increase unemployment, but he is optimistic that once inflation is tamed, we can recover whatever ground was lost and enjoy sustained growth. He cites the Volcker precedent: \u201cWhile what Volcker did was painful in the moment,\u201d he says, \u201cit paid dividends for decades.\u201d But Kashkari also acknowledges that the cost of curbing inflation will probably fall hardest on the most vulnerable. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the crisis to come along where the rich get hurt,\u201d he says. Those sentiments haven\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 mollify critics who think the Fed is showing callous disregard for the economic welfare of millions of Americans. Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, believes that the central bank has raised interest rates much more aggressively than circumstances warrant. What she finds particularly objectionable is that Fed officials, including Kashkari, claim to be acting in the interest of people on the margins. But in her view, current Fed policy is putting lower-income Americans needlessly at risk. While there is always debate about whether inflation or unemployment is worse, Sahm contends that joblessness is unquestionably more harmful for those at the bottom: \u201cIf you are living paycheck to paycheck, yes, higher inflation hurts,\u201d she says, \u201cbut no paycheck hurts a lot more.\u201d\n\nDanny Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth College, was an author of a 2014 study that found that being unemployed was indeed worse for a person\u2019s economic and emotional well-being than rising inflation. Like Sahm, he disagrees with the Fed\u2019s rate increases (he thinks high inflation is, in fact, temporary), and is disappointed but not surprised that Kashkari, in his judgment, capitulated to the hawks. Blanchflower served for three years on the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee and says the desire for consensus at central banks, especially in emergency situations, can make it very hard to hold dissenting views. Still, he wishes that Kashkari had stood firm. \u201cHis dovish message has been lost,\u201d Blanchflower says. \u201cWhy did he give up?\u201d On Dec. 14, the Fed raised interest rates for the seventh time in 2022 and indicated that further increases were probable. In a news conference that day, Powell, the Fed chair, said he didn\u2019t think anyone knew whether a recession was inevitable but acknowledged that the odds of achieving a so-called soft landing \u2014 in which inflation is brought under control by slowing economic growth without causing a recession \u2014 were diminishing. He seemed to suggest that hard times were coming. \u201cI wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d It was a sobering message not just for the public but perhaps also for President Biden, whose political fortunes could hinge on what the Fed does from here. (Powell declined to comment for this article.) The encouraging news is that inflation is easing. The Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I., which is the government\u2019s main inflation gauge, rose 7.1 percent, down from a peak increase of 9.1 percent recorded in June. Since then, the average price of gas has fallen by $1.19 per gallon. It seems most of the arrows are now pointing in the right direction. An exception, at least from the Fed\u2019s perspective, is the labor market. The Fed is worried about wage growth as a source of inflation. With unemployment so low, companies are having to pay more to keep the workers they have and to hire new ones. Wages are currently rising at around 5 percent year over year, and unless that slows, the Fed will struggle to get inflation back to around 2 percent \u2014 and the danger is that if it doesn\u2019t slow, businesses will raise prices to cover their added labor costs, which could spark a dreaded phenomenon known as the wage-price spiral. Odd as it might seem to regard wage increases as a problem, Fed officials note that inflation is eroding those gains. It\u2019s possible that the labor market has undergone a structural change as a result of the pandemic. At least 1.1 million Americans have died from Covid-19, which has effectively shrunk the pool of available workers. Long Covid has undoubtedly sidelined many Americans, and the pandemic also led a lot of people to take early retirement. The upshot is that there are not enough workers to fill all the available jobs, a situation made worse by the prepandemic decline in legal immigration. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are currently 1.7 job vacancies for every one job seeker. When I spoke to Kashkari in early December, he noted that, even after all the Fed\u2019s rate increases, the labor market was still incredibly tight. \u201cThe No. 1 issue I hear from employers in our region is that they can\u2019t find workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence when I talk to them of any softening of labor demand.\u201d The Fed hopes that vacancies will decline as businesses resign themselves to leaving jobs unfilled and that this might be enough to cool wage growth without a sizable uptick in unemployment. In its most recent forecast, however, released last month, the Fed projected that unemployment would rise to 4.6 percent from 3.7 percent this year, which equates to the loss of around 1.5 million jobs. There is skepticism among economists that the central bank can bring inflation down to its target rate without a big jump in joblessness. \u201cGetting all the way to 2 percent could be very hard,\u201d says Jason Furman, the economist at Harvard. \u201cI think it could require a large increase in unemployment if the Fed really needs the inflation rate to get back to 2 percent.\u201d The prospect of mass layoffs and a recession has prompted renewed discussion about whether the Fed should even be aiming for 2 percent inflation, which has been the official target since 2012 (and was the unstated goal for many years before that). Some economists argue that 2 percent is too low because it constrains the Fed\u2019s ability to pull the economy out of downturns, and they fear that the cost of driving inflation back to that level could be punishing. \u201cIn the months ahead,\u201d the New York Times Opinion columnist Paul Krugman recently wrote, \u201cwe may well face a choice between imposing a recession to get inflation back down to a largely arbitrary target, which we wouldn\u2019t have chosen 20 years ago if we\u2019d known then what we know now, and declaring victory with inflation fairly low but not quite that low.\u201d Fed officials insist that they have no intention for now of backing away from 2 percent. At his news conference last month, Powell was unequivocal: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to consider that under any circumstances.\u201d When I spoke recently with the former Fed chair Ben Bernanke, he told me that it would be a mistake for the central bank to abandon its own target while battling the highest inflation that the country has experienced in decades. \u201cWhatever the merits of the case for changing the inflation target in the long run, it can\u2019t be done now because of the damage it would do to the Fed\u2019s credibility,\u201d Bernanke said. \u201cYou can\u2019t move the goal posts when you are behind in the game.\u201d\n\nBut Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, suspects the Fed may end up deciding that 3 percent or thereabouts is close enough. Blanchard has long believed that 2 percent is too low and that 3 percent would give the Fed more flexibility. And for consumers, he adds, the difference between 2 percent inflation and 3 percent is negligible. On the other hand, getting to 2 percent from 3 percent could inflict a lot of additional economic pain on the country. Blanchard argues that if inflation falls rapidly over the next few months, some observers will feel that the battle has been won and that the Fed should stand down. \u201cPeople will say: \u2018We\u2019ve beaten inflation, you want to reduce inflation from 3 to 2, which we don\u2019t care about, and you may have to do a recession again? That\u2019s crazy stuff.\u2019\u201d If a recession is unavoidable, the Biden administration obviously hopes it will be brief. The Volcker era offers some encouragement. After the recession of 1981-82, the economy rebounded very quickly, and in 1984, President Reagan was re-elected in a 49-state landslide. But if the current tightening cycle results in a slowdown that persists into next year, scrutiny of the Fed could intensify. The central bank is normally pretty adept at resisting pressure from the White House \u2014 \u201cThe best thing you can do if you are in the Fed is put earmuffs on and just don\u2019t listen,\u201d Alan Greenspan advised in jest. And in contrast to Donald Trump, who lashed out at Powell over the Fed\u2019s rate increases in 2018, President Biden, arch-institutionalist, will undoubtedly refrain from criticizing the Fed publicly. But his allies on Capitol Hill may not be so circumspect. The Fed is an unelected body, and if it triggers a prolonged recession, it could find itself in a political maelstrom. When I spoke to Kashkari last month, he said that while the most recent data was promising, he was not yet convinced that inflation had peaked and believed that it would be a mistake for the Fed to pause the rate increases. His views carry more weight now, because he is a voting member of the F.O.M.C. this year; the committee\u2019s next meeting runs Jan. 31 to Feb. 1. I commented that the financial markets didn\u2019t seem to believe that the Fed would stay the course. The central bank, in its latest forecast, had projected that the Fed Funds Rate would increase to at least 5 percent and that there would be no rate cuts this year. But the markets were pricing in cuts starting in its second half. \u201cI\u2019ve spent enough time around Wall Street to know that they are culturally, institutionally, optimistic,\u201d Kashkari replied. I said it seemed almost as if the markets were playing chicken with the Fed. Kashkari laughed. \u201cThey are going to lose the game of chicken, I can tell you that,\u201d he said. He conceded, though, that the coming months could test the Fed\u2019s resolve. Thus far, Fed officials have been virtually unanimous in support of higher interest rates. Kashkari said that this solidarity might become harder to maintain the longer the inflation battle drags on, especially if \u2014 or when \u2014 the labor market cools. If inflation were to fall to 3 percent with unemployment increasing to 6 percent, things could get tricky. He personally wouldn\u2019t flinch: The Fed\u2019s credibility was at stake, and it was obligated to get inflation down to 2 percent and \u201cnot just come up short because it is too painful to get there,\u201d as he put it. Kashkari couldn\u2019t say for sure that others at the Fed would remain so unyielding, however. \u201cThere are going to be tougher judgment calls to make.\u201d Michael Steinberger is a contributing writer for the magazine.

In 2021, the Justice Department seized Mr. Giuliani\u2019s cellphones and computers as part of a separate investigation into his efforts to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden in Ukraine.\n\nWhile acting as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Giuliani undertook an array of efforts on his behalf.\n\nHe promoted a baseless conspiracy theory that a cabal of international actors had hacked into voting machines produced by Dominion Voting Systems and used them to rig the election for Mr. Biden \u2014 despite the fact that an internal memo from the Trump campaign had determined earlier that many of the outlandish claims about Dominion were untrue.\n\nMr. Giuliani also made persistent claims that the voting had been marred by widespread cheating and irregularities at a series of informal legislative hearings in key swing states around the country. But when he personally appeared in court in Philadelphia to defend a lawsuit challenging the election, he acknowledged to the judge in the case that the suit had not alleged that fraud had actually occurred.",

Like a lot of people who get into professional wrestling, Donovan Danhausen had a vision of a different version of himself. Ten years ago, at age 21, he was living in Detroit, working as a nursing assistant at a nearby hospital, watching a lot of \u201cAdult Swim\u201d and accumulating a collection of horror- and comedy-themed tattoos. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew that he liked to make short videos with his friends, the kind of outsider art that happens in basements and backyards across America. At the suggestion of one of those friends, he took a 12-week training course at the House of Truth wrestling school in Center Line, Mich., and then entered the indie circuit as a hand: an unknown, unpaid wrestler who shows up at events and does what\u2019s asked of him, typically setting up the ring, pretending to be a lawyer or other species of extra, maybe participating in a battle royale. For the next few years, he worked shows around the Great Lakes region, wrestling strangers or sometimes the guy he rode up with, trying to figure out where he fit in. Danhausen climbed the ladder from hand to known amateur, then local headliner and traveling feature talent, but he remained firmly within the world of day jobs and inconsistently reimbursed expenses. By 2017, he had moved to Florida and was plying the local indie circuit as Kid Gorgeous, surviving on a job at Starbucks and what little he earned wrestling at shows within driving distance of Miami. It was not working. Most weeks he would clock in to Starbucks at 5 a.m., clock out at 1 and then travel to an event. One night, after what was supposed to be a chest kick caught him in the throat \u2014 a painful injury that briefly made him worry he might lose his ability to speak \u2014 he sat in his car and thought, I am not having fun. He was driving a lot, getting hurt and not getting paid. The struggle to sell himself to audiences as a physical specimen felt like skating uphill. \u201cI was just a bearded guy with the tattoos, trying to be a tough guy, and I\u2019m not a tough guy naturally,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I can be weird and charismatic, goofy. That\u2019s easy. That\u2019s also a role that most people don\u2019t want to fill.\u201d Five years into his wrestling career, Danhausen did what any serious artist does when he runs out of momentum: He looked for a new gimmick. He had fond memories of Halloweens, when his father made him up as a zombie, so he put on black and white face paint. At first, the idea was serious. The character \u2014 also named Danhausen \u2014 was supposed to be an evil demon. But Danhausen the man found that the more elements of humor he incorporated into his performance, the more audiences responded. He stopped growling with the agony of the damned and started ordering the crowd to clap and cheer for him. He made his physical movements less creepy and more awkward. These changes made the character more fun to play and brought it in line with his life outside wrestling, which did not include a background in competitive sports, much less fighting. The sole entry on his combat sports r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was one karate class he attended at age 6, which he left when he learned they would have to be barefoot. Other than that: \u201cI have no background in anything. I don\u2019t have a wrestling background. I\u2019m not into sports. I don\u2019t have an improv background. I watched wrestling, and I watched \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also has what may be the first signature move in wrestling history that does not involve touching his opponents at all. He curses them, a metaphysical attack he executes by pointing both forefingers, one at arm\u2019s length and the other near his chin, while bugging out his eyes. The crowd goes wild, but otherwise, nothing really happens after he does it \u2014 at least not at first. But a cursed opponent might subsequently swing a folding chair in such a way that it rebounds off the turnbuckle and hits him in the face, or he might slip and fall as he climbs out of the ring, or he may just get distracted at the critical moment and fail to see another wrestler charging in from behind. Danhausen\u2019s dubious command of occult forces is only one aspect of his absurd presentation, which blurs the line between what is supposed to be real in the fictive world of pro wrestling and what is supposed to be his character\u2019s own delusion. He is not \u201c6-foot-7, probably,\u201d as his self-reported measurements claim, nor does he weigh in at \u201cover 300 pounds.\u201d At 5-foot-10 and roughly 175 pounds, the real Danhausen is physically unimposing. It was this final element \u2014 active denial of his own limitations as a wrestler \u2014 that turned his whole gimmick into a kind of commentary on wrestling itself. And he has found that this commentary resonates deeply with the class of obsessive fans who attend indie shows and watch videos of indie wrestling on the internet. \u201cWrestling is a parody of sports \u2014 it always was,\u201d RJ City, a fellow A.E.W. wrestler and a longtime friend of Danhausen\u2019s, told me. \u201cBut this is now a parody of that parody.\u201d\n\nLate in 2021, Danhausen was approached by Tony Khan, the co-owner and chief executive of All Elite Wrestling, an upstart promotion carried by TBS and TNT that is disrupting a long period of industry stasis. Over the last two decades, the story of the wrestling business has been World Wrestling Entertainment, commonly known as W.W.E., exercising unchallenged dominance over the industry. In September 2021, however, A.E.W.\u2019s \u201cDynamite\u201d drew a larger share of 18-to-49-year-olds than W.W.E.\u2019s \u201cRaw\u201d for two consecutive weeks. This seemingly modest news \u2014 a temporary blip in the ratings \u2014 constituted a seismic event among hard-core wrestling fans, many of whom regard the W.W.E. in roughly the way fans of indie rock regard major record labels. While W.W.E. remains the larger promotion in both audience size and estimated value, there is now a No. 2. A.E.W. tends to attract longtime enthusiasts, connoisseurs, what the culture sometimes refers to as \u201cmarks.\u201d These are the people who shout \u201cWoo!\u201d \u2014 the signature vocalization of Ric Flair \u2014 when someone does a backhand chop, a signature move of Ric Flair. Marks love Danhausen. To them, he represents a different kind of star for a new era of pro wrestling \u2014 one who appeals to obsessive consumers who feel underserved by what they perceive as the W.W.E.\u2019s focus on capturing the largest audience possible. Now that he is a fan favorite, Danhausen\u2019s ostensible power to manipulate the outcomes of his matches has become the power to manipulate the industry itself; the curses aren\u2019t real, but the popularity that incentivizes A.E.W. to make him a winner is. Danhausen occupies a point of singularity in the manifold of artifice and truth that is the pro-wrestling universe: the place where the story and the show and the business intersect. It is true that pro wrestling is fake. While we\u2019re at it, so are movies, television and a substantial portion of the internet. The show, however, is real. The experience of watching the fake wrestling match \u2014 in which performer-athletes playing exaggerated or downright invented versions of themselves engage in an improvised stage combat whose winner has been determined in advance \u2014 and feeling either entertained or bored is real. The fun of being a wrestling fan, especially at a live event, is that you get to boo the heels and cheer the faces (as the good guys are known) in accordance with your understanding of the fake world of the show, but you also get to express your own enjoyment of or dissatisfaction with that show in a way that is totally, viscerally real. The business is also real. For many hard-core fans, it constitutes a kind of show beyond the show that is sometimes more interesting than any given match, the way draft picks and salary caps are occasionally of primary interest to fans of the N.B.A. The workings of the wrestling business are sometimes incorporated into the world of the show, as in the case of Vincent K. McMahon, the former chairman and chief executive of W.W.E., who for years played a heightened version of himself that antagonized wrestlers and audiences alike. This fictional character reflected actual resentments. Before the 1980s, televised professional wrestling was a patchwork of deals between local broadcasters and regional promotions, which operated in a kind of feudal system of defined albeit periodically contested territories. In 1983, McMahon\u2019s World Wrestling Federation embarked on a period of aggressive expansion, snapping up talent and driving rival promotions out of business until the previously fractured wrestling audience became a single, nationwide market that W.W.F. could dominate through star power and superior capital outlay. The last meaningful challenge to this dominance came in 1995, when Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling introduced \u201cMonday Nitro\u201d on TNT, directly opposite W.W.F.\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Raw.\u201d After a ratings contest that lasted a little over a year, W.C.W.\u2019s audience share began to falter, and W.W.F. \u2014 which had changed its name to World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, before shortening it to World Wrestling Entertainment \u2014 purchased W.C.W.\u2019s intellectual property and the contracts of its most popular wrestlers in 2001. In the two decades since, W.W.E. has enjoyed something like a monopoly on televised professional wrestling, which allowed stars like the Rock and John Cena to cross over to a mainstream audience and now threatens to relieve the company of the need to please its most hard-core fans. In August 2021, W.W.E.\u2019s president, Nick Khan, who is not related to Tony, caused a stir when he said that W.W.E. was interested in looking beyond the normal indie-wrestling channels to find new talent.\n\nTony Khan has built A.E.W.\u2019s roster around a combination of fan favorites from the indie circuit and older veterans of televised wrestling. A kind of mark himself, he claims to have kept notebooks since age 12 that detailed characters and story lines for shows that would eventually become \u201cDynamite\u201d and \u201cRampage,\u201d A.E.W.\u2019s Wednesday- and Friday-night programs. Khan is 40, wears his hair bushy and speaks in a fluent monotone, with the confidence and peculiar affect that signal generational wealth; his father, Shahid Khan, is an auto-parts billionaire and co-owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fulham Football Club. There seems to be no aspect of A.E.W.\u2019s operation in which Tony Khan is not involved. Our formal interview backstage during Memorial Day weekend\u2019s \u201cRampage\u201d event took place while he was on a headset with the production truck, the in-ring referee, the announcing team and the veteran wrestler Dustin Rhodes, who assists with the live show in various ways, including by identifying each in-ring move for the broadcast announcers. Khan\u2019s role in this process is to ensure that the largely improvised show progresses according to the schedule determined by the television deal; during our conversation, he repeatedly interrupted himself to give timing instructions to the referee, who then surreptitiously communicated them to the wrestlers in the ring. Partly because we were behind a curtain and partly because of the subwoofer-reinforced booms of wrestlers slamming each other onto the miked-up canvas, speaking to him was like meeting a less defensive but more distracted Wizard of Oz. Khan regards the indie circuit as an invaluable source of talent. \u201cI like to take people\u2019s presentation once it\u2019s gotten over, once it\u2019s gotten popular and been accepted,\u201d he told me. \u201cGetting over\u201d is a term of art; wrestlers are \u201cover\u201d when the audience starts enthusiastically responding to them, positively or negatively. \u201cIf you find people that have gotten over with a smaller, hard-core audience, often if you give them a chance on national television, the hard-core audience will vouch for them.\u201d \u2018I think we\u2019re all weirdos, and they can connect with that. In a good way. Good weird.\u2019 He was placing a big bet on this strategy Memorial Day weekend. Khan had already kept Danhausen on the roster for months while an injury he sustained at an indie event in Knoxville, Tenn. \u2014 a broken tibia and fibula \u2014 left him unable to wrestle. Now Khan had decided to make Danhausen\u2019s match the buy-in for A.E.W.\u2019s annual \u201cDouble or Nothing\u201d event in Las Vegas \u2014 the first match of the event, which airs on free TV as an enticement for ambivalent fans to buy the pay per view. So not only would it be Danhausen\u2019s first major in-ring performance after returning from injury, in front of the largest crowd of his career \u2014 at that point, T-Mobile Arena had sold out at a little over 14,000 seats \u2014 but it would also be of crucial importance to his new employer and set the tone for the biggest event in company history. Which would all be fine, Danhausen assured me, because the main lesson he had learned from wrestling was that you couldn\u2019t really control what happened to you, but you could maximize the opportunity in whatever did. \u201cIf you get cut and you have a minute,\u201d he said, \u201cyou just make the most of your minute.\u201d By 10:45 on Saturday morning, the line to meet Hangman Adam Page at the \u201cDouble or Nothing\u201d Fan Fest event in the Mandalay Bay Convention Center threatened to stretch past the logistically important center of the room. The line for the announcer and former wrestler Taz was the second-longest, and Danhausen\u2019s was third. He stood at a cafe table at the end of a tension-barrier chute and steadily autographed a stack of playing-card-themed promotional photos A.E.W. created for the event. No cellphone pictures were allowed, but a company photographer was on hand to snap one picture of him with each fan or group of fans. He made the curse gesture for just about every photo. Danhausen was in makeup but not in character, a choice that seemed equally jarring and thrilling to his admirers. One fan brought him a copy of \u201cAn American Werewolf in London\u201d on DVD \u2014 something Danhausen already had, but not on Blu-ray, which the fan insisted was hard to find \u2014 and they conversed briefly about the genius of David Naughton. One element of Danhausen\u2019s appeal seems to be that the panoply of pop-culture references in his gimmick \u2014 to \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d to B-horror movies, to cartoons like \u201cThe Venture Bros.\u201d and \u201cSpace Ghost\u201d and to the shared inheritance of wrestling history \u2014 creates a series of recognitions among fans, who may not get what he is doing at first but immediately understand that the person doing it is somehow like them. \u201cI think we\u2019re all weirdos, and they can connect with that,\u201d Danhausen said. \u201cIn a good way. Good weird.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the predetermined outcomes of individual matches, pro wrestling follows story lines that are planned out in advance by writers or, in the case of A.E.W., via a collective effort by Khan, a handful of veteran hires and the wrestlers themselves. But wrestling is nonetheless a competitive sport, because performers who consistently receive big responses from fans will find themselves in more and bigger events. Generally speaking, wrestlers advance toward the championship on the size of their \u201cpop\u201d \u2014 the reaction they get from the crowd \u2014 which is real and ultimately beyond the control of promoters. Phil Brooks, who as CM Punk has held seven championships with four different promotions and was A.E.W. world champion twice in 2022, described the process of developing a wrestling persona as being repeatedly surprised by the reactions of the crowd \u2014 a feeling he characterized as \u201cI don\u2019t know why they like that, but they like it.\u201d Sometimes, the interplay between wrestler and crowd can take a gimmick somewhere surprising to both. Dustin Rhodes, for example, got over to an astonishing degree in the late 1990s as the bizarre heel Goldust, an androgynous \u201cliving Oscar\u201d who used wrestling as an opportunity to sexually harass other men. Rhodes solidified this gimmick midway through a circa 1995 match against Savio Vega, locking up with him and briefly caressing his chest before rolling out of the ring. Rhodes described the crowd\u2019s reaction as \u201cthe most evil hate I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d \u2014 a concentrated version of the heat it is a heel\u2019s job to generate. As soon as he heard that response, he knew he had to commit to the character. \u201cThat\u2019s the first reaction I had gotten in six months,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was hard, but once I did it \u2014 man, that night, it changed my life.\u201d Danhausen can\u2019t cite a single night that changed his life the way Rhodes can. He doesn\u2019t remember when the gimmick really clicked, but I keep thinking about a YouTube video from 2019, in which he appears opposite one Pretty Boy Smooth in an event billed as \u201cno ring, no rules\u201d \u2014 a wrestling match in a bar, from which some, but not all, of the tables have been removed, attended by about 30 people. The room has that quiet sound that bedevils any show in front of a very small audience, but Danhausen is fully committed. Pretty Boy Smooth is the larger man, and at one point Danhausen tries to pick him up and just can\u2019t. It\u2019s a pleasing gag \u2014 not just the sight of Danhausen struggling to lift him, cartoon style, but also knowing that he is faking struggling, really selling it, heaving himself against the other man\u2019s weight with his hands immobile. Of all the unlikely things wrestlers do with their bodies, you never see them do anything like this \u2014 this Buster Keaton physical language of mundane frustration. You look at it and think, That\u2019s how it would go for me, if I wound up in there. We may never know what it is about a physically unimpressive misfit living in a fantasy world that appeals to wrestling fans, but coming into \u201cDouble or Nothing\u201d Memorial Day weekend, Danhausen was finally, deliriously over. On Sunday afternoon, roughly 90 minutes before he was set to enter the ring, Danhausen was worried about his tights. The custom pair he had had shipped to the FedEx office at Mandalay Bay the day before turned out to be too small and made of some material intractable to A.E.W.\u2019s team of traveling seamsters, who were at that moment sewing frantically at a row of machines they had set up in the hallway. Danhausen had commissioned another set of tights from a local tailor who promised they would be ready by showtime, but now that person had stopped answering his texts. In response to these conditions, as in seemingly all things, Danhausen tried to maintain a positive attitude. But even beneath the makeup, his face bore the expression of a man experiencing only limited success in assuring himself that, when he walked down the ramp to the biggest performance of his career, he would be fully clothed.\n\nDanhausen\u2019s friend and fellow A.E.W. wrestler Orange Cassidy assured him that he was so over he could go out there in jeans, but Danhausen was worried about crack. If a wrestler shows cleavage in the ring, the internet will not forget. He texted again and then released his phone a little too vigorously onto the road box around which we had gathered. His parents were in town, he observed. After what may have been 10 of the longer minutes of his life, the man with the backup tights arrived, and Danhausen returned to normal, unfocused preshow jitters. For the last several weeks, he had been working a narrative in which he tried and failed to befriend another wrestler named Hook \u2014 a story line dubbed, in tabloid style, Hookhausen. Hook\u2019s gimmick is essentially the same as that of my teenage son: brooding, with high-volume Zoomer hair that hangs into his eyes and makes him seem either surly or deep, depending on your demographic. He is a thrilling in-ring wrestler who combines judo-influenced throws with explosive speed and low body-fat percentage, but his presentation is also deeply serious in a way that risks shading over into unintentional comedy. Pairing him with Danhausen was a genius move for which no one at A.E.W. seemed willing to take credit. Khan would divulge only that \u201cA very smart person suggested it to me.\u201d Shortly before \u201cDouble or Nothing,\u201d Danhausen had finally secured Hook\u2019s approval in the form of a symbolically important handshake, bringing to a climax a series of events that not only bought Danhausen time to rehab his leg but also set up the night\u2019s tag-team match, which pit him and Hook against the Premier Athlete Tony Nese \u2014 a body guy who is not above kissing his own biceps to rile up the crowd \u2014 and Smart Mark Sterling, Esq., whose improbable gimmick is that, even though he is a lawyer, he is not that smart. Danhausen\u2019s goal for this match was, putting it crassly, to live up to the hype: He wanted to prove that he was not just a fan favorite with good mic skills but also a talented wrestler who could work an audience from inside the ring. Beyond that, it seemed as though he was still pleasantly surprised to be there. He told me he had no interest in signing with W.W.E., the logical next step in any wrestler\u2019s career, because he felt A.E.W. was better suited to his act. That was, of course, the correct thing to say, but it also seemed true. For him, A.E.W. is not the minor league so much as a place where Danhausen can be Danhausen, in front of an audience who appreciates what he is doing. When his entrance music came bumping out of the speakers at T-Mobile Arena \u2014 a kitschy riff on Saturday-morning cartoon themes, complete with a video package of hypnotic spirals and floating depictions of his own head \u2014 approximately 14,000 such people stood up and cheered. As he marched down the ramp in cape and mostly fitting tights, he seemed to take a moment to drink it all in. \u201cMneeagh!\u201d he said, a sound of ghoulish delight. Then he climbed through the ropes and did what he had planned to do: get thrown around the ring by Nese for the better part of four minutes, occasionally pulling off a spectacular move but mostly being manhandled as he tried and failed to tag in Hook, in a series of near misses that teased the audience into a frenzy. When he finally touched his younger partner\u2019s hand, the pop was enormous. Hook made short work of Nese, then dragged Sterling over the top rope and slammed him into catatonia. He was about to pin him and end the match when he turned and saw Danhausen frantically calling for the tag. After briefly consulting with the crowd, Hook tagged his partner in. Danhausen marched across the ring, his face a mixture of triumph and shock, and planted one foot on Sterling\u2019s chest. He raised his hands and shouted along with the fans as they roared their approval. The guy who stood no chance of winning had won. It was exactly what was supposed to happen.",

            "content": "You know, you think about, so many of the problems of sex in a long-term relationship is trying to recapture the magic and intensity and passion of the beginning, and so much of the sex advice-industrial complex is about lying to people and telling them they can, right, or that they should, and that it\u2019s possible. And a long-term relationship, by weight of \u2014 and we\u2019re not really even talking now about, you know, \u201cRethinking Sex,\u201d \u201cThe Right to Sex.\u201d The problem of connection, and how atomized people are these days, and the difficulty, particularly younger people are having, in finding each other and the paradox of choice \u2014 if there\u2019s too many different kinds of mustard in the mustard aisle at the grocery store, people walk down that aisle and don\u2019t get mustard, even if it was on their list, because they can\u2019t choose, and, really, the internet has created for many people that \u2014 and so it\u2019s not all people who feel low status, who feel cheated, who feel unmarketable for some reason. A lot of people who are, you know, in the mustard aisle of, like, dating apps, and want to pick a jar of mustard and would like to have mustard at home whenever they want it can\u2019t quite bring themselves to do it, and I think all of these problems and how we figure out how to address them are better problems to have than what people pine for, which are when women didn\u2019t have options, when women weren\u2019t legal adults, when women couldn\u2019t have credit cards or bank accounts or sign leases, when women were property, and a lot of men wound up in relationships with women who were there under duress, and we called that \u201cmarriage,\u201d right? And that\u2019s not the case anymore. And how do we control for that? How do we control for high-status men churning through as many women as they can get, just like high-status gay men used to be able to churn through a lot of male partners, and then how do we control for low status or low social skills? You know, when I talk to incels, and I\u2019ve talked to incels \u2014 I\u2019ve gotten on the phone with some people privately \u2014 you think of that movie, I think, \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d with Helen Hunt. It\u2019s about a sex worker going to see a profoundly physically disabled client, and everyone\u2019s like, oh, that\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s complicated, because we have weird, screwed-up feelings about sex work and whether it\u2019s legitimate, whether it\u2019s work or not, whether it should be legal or not, safe or not \u2014 that\u2019s the argument when it comes to the legality of sex work. It\u2019s not whether it\u2019s going to exist or not, or it\u2019s going to be safe, or riskier than all jobs are. And we recognize that, if somebody is profoundly physically disabled, that the attention and affection of a sex worker is a wonderful thing to be provided, sometimes even by family, to that person. Well, a lot of the incels that I\u2019ve actually spoken to are profoundly socially disabled. I think that disability, when somebody who has profound social disabilities sees a sex worker, we should be able to recognize that, that need for affection, that need for sex, this route to obtaining it and the improvement of the quality of life of that person, it\u2019s legitimate. It\u2019s legitimate. And it is a net good, and we should make that easier \u2014 not, you know, through federal subsidies, you know, the Department of Sex Work. We should make that easier by eliminating the stigma and giving people who do sex work or see sex workers the benefit of the doubt, and then also to recognize in people who see sex workers, to recognize ourselves, to recognize the ways in which, even in our own committed relationships, there are still these transactional elements. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not affection. Everyone I know who is a sex worker who has long-term clients, those are relationships of real, lasting affection. Those are long-term relationships. And yet we want to knock those relationships down to purely transactional; we want to call them crimes; and then we refuse to recognize in our own relationships the transactional elements that might help us empathize with people who have no other outlet except a sex worker.\n\nPeople know how to ask for what they want, you know, from a waiter. People know how to ask, often, for what they want from a sex worker. You know, one of the things, when it comes out, as it has, people who call me to write me, their partner was seeing a sex worker, and was doing with the sex worker, something they never asked the partner to do with them, and it was because they weren\u2019t afraid that the sex worker would leave them. And, usually, when people have a hard time communicating about sex, desire, intimacy, relationships, there\u2019s this fear of rejection, fear of being judged, fear of being left. Early in a relationship, you should embrace rejection, and you should run at that fear. You have to be willing to risk it. That\u2019s how you become a better communicator. You can\u2019t ask for what you want if you\u2019re not willing to risk losing what you have. And what you might risk losing is this person that you just met on an app that you\u2019re getting along with and you\u2019d like to see naked and you risk communicating, not in a, like, if you come home with me, we\u2019re gonna do four things from column A, four things from column B, and one thing from column C, but just, like, being actually who you are. In some ways, you have to straddle this creation of the Potemkin self, your best self, and your real self. You have to do both at the same time, and that can be difficult. And I\u2019m not trying to dodge your question here. It\u2019s just about disinhibiting around the fear of rejection \u2014 that, if this person isn\u2019t right for you, give them a chance. Allow them to give you a chance. There may be things that you don\u2019t agree on. You know, everything won\u2019t be on the menu, but so much is, and so much does work that, you know, you\u2019re willing to let go of some things and round them up. They\u2019re going to round you up. You\u2019re willing to pay certain prices of admission. But you have to be willing to risk rejection, and that\u2019s why people have a hard time communicating. So, if you were going to open the yellow pages in 1972 and try to find where to go to get strong, you look for the gym. You just have to \u2014 there\u2019s no willing-to-risk-rejection coach in the yellow pages, but that\u2019s what you have to be willing to do, and that\u2019s inside you. And that\u2019s really about prioritizing your needs, your comfort, what you want, and finding somebody who wants enough of what you want, and enough of what you are, and vise versa, that it would work out long term, which is not to say that \u2014 one of the things I like to talk about is that we overemphasize the importance or the primacy of long-term relationships. We have many more short-term relationships, and we should want those to be successes too. I don\u2019t think a relationship has to end with somebody in a box at a funeral home for it to have been a success, but death is our only standard of success. You know, a relationship is the only thing that we regard as a failure of everyone involved gets out alive. Imagine if we applied that standard to restaurants or flights, right? If it\u2019s a high-conflict relationship and a terrible divorce, and nobody can stand each other or speak to each other again, if there was abuse, emotional, physical, yeah, that relationship needed to end and was probably experienced as a failure, particularly by the person who was abused. If two people get out of a relationship and there\u2019s affection and respect, even a friendship, even if it ended, it was a success. And if we just looked at all of our relationships, we have so many short-term relationships, and we work so hard at making the L.T.R.s a success that we neglect making the S.T.R.s a success, and all an L.T.R. is an S.T.R. that worked out.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Congratulations to Emily Rourke, who is making her second appearance as a New York Times Crossword constructor. Today\u2019s puzzle is a simple, cheerful example of how a phrase or term can be reinterpreted into a wordplay revealer that an entire puzzle can be built around. One of my favorite things about writing this column is learning about what sparks the initial idea for a constructor\u2019s theme. These kernels of inspiration have included posters at a gym, viral YouTube videos and plenty of other silly jumping-off points. Today\u2019s puzzle was inspired by Ms. Rourke\u2019s cat \u2014 and I\u2019m sure solvers will see why. But before we get to the theme, let\u2019s examine a few of today\u2019s tougher clues. 1A. People who eschew musical theater may not know that the \u201c\u2018Rent\u2019 character who sings \u2018Light my Candle\u2019\u201d is MIMI. Fun fact: \u201cRent\u201d is loosely based on the Giacomo Puccini opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d in which another character named MIMI requests help lighting a candle.\n\n50A. I don\u2019t know whether I would have chosen to use the clue \u201c___ Gay (W.W. II plane)\u201d for ENOLA, the name of the plane that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan, especially given today\u2019s (Japan-adjacent) theme. ENOLA Holmes is always an alternative clue option for this word. 52A. The clue \u201cSong refrain syllable\u201d is often used for TRA, which is also part of the singsong \u201cTRA la la.\u201d In fact, TRA has appeared with a similar clue more than 500 times in the New York Times Crossword. 34D. I\u2019m most familiar with the word PETARD in the context of the expression \u201choisted on his own PETARD,\u201d which has always led me to believe that a PETARD was something like a flagpole. Instead, a PETARD is an \u201cOld explosive device used to breach castle walls.\u201d I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be hoisted on one of those \u2014 my own or otherwise! 41D. \u201c\u2018___, sure, you betcha!\u2019 (classic Minnesotan expression)\u201d is a fun fill-in-the-blank clue for YAH, which I can\u2019t even mentally read without pronouncing it in an exaggerated Minnesotan accent.\n\nThis puzzle features four familiar felines and a revealer that instructs you on how you might greet them: HELLO KITTY. The revealer clue at 39A reads, \u201cFictional feline from Japan \u2026 or how one might greet 17-, 24-, 54- or 65-Across.\u201d Each of the theme clues contains the name of another fictional feline:\n\u2022 None 17A. PINK PANTHER (\u201cTitular animated character whose theme music is by Henry Mancini\u201d)\n\u2022 None 24A. TONY THE TIGER (\u201cCereal mascot who says \u2018They\u2019re gr-r-reat!\u2019\u201d) Now, I\u2019m not generally a stickler for the lore surrounding fictional felines, but I did recently learn (from a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch, below, and from a Los Angeles Times article I read after seeing it) that HELLO KITTY is not, in fact, a feline. According to Sanrio, the company that owns the rights to HELLO KITTY, she is a little British girl who lives with her parents, her twin sister and pet cat (!!!) named Charmmy Kitty.\n\nIn my view, that \u201cfact,\u201d insofar as there can be \u201cfacts\u201d about fictional characters, doesn\u2019t make this theme any less charming (charmmy?). This is a tidy set of fictional felines tied together by a fun revealer that may or may not also be about a fictional feline. What\u2019s not to love? And there you have it! Kudos to Ms. Rourke on this puzzle. Let\u2019s hear from her about the origins of this puzzle and her own nonfictional feline. I was inspired to construct a feline-themed crossword after we adopted our cat, Sperry, in 2021. Every day she sits in my lap as I complete the New York Times Crossword, so it seems fitting that her feline family members feature in a puzzle of their own. Cereal is also an important component of my morning crossword routine, so I\u2019m pleased that 24-Across made it into the final version. I had a lot of fun diving into the universe of fictional cats, and my only regret was having to cut Puss in Boots. Happy New Year and happy solving! Want to Submit Crosswords to The New York Times?

            "content": "Damien Cave has been reporting from Sydney since 2017.\n\nThe central atrium of Sydney Modern, the new Sanaa-designed extension for the Art Gallery of New South Wales, with Lisa Reihana\u2019s \u2018\u2018Groundloop,\u2019\u2019 a monumental work on the upper level. Right, the light-filled MOD. Dining restaurant.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAn extension to the Art Gallery of New South Wales brings 21st-century design to a city that has often had a love-hate relationship with future-forward art.\n\nCan the Sydney Modern Change How a \u2018Sporting Nation\u2019 Sees Itself?\n\nOn one of his first official tours through the new Sydney Modern, after roughly a decade developing the project as director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Michael Brand highlighted a few signature pieces: a new commission by an Aboriginal artist using found metal; an immersive sculpture, first exhibited in Seoul, that visitors create by rolling balls of clay; and a giant video from a New Zealander, imagining Oceania without people of European descent. But at each stop Sydney\u2019s natural surroundings beckoned. State officials following Brand \u2014 after forking over most of the museum\u2019s $230 million in construction costs \u2014 praised the views more than the art. The new free-standing building, designed by Sanaa, Japan\u2019s Pritzker-prize-winning architects, also seemed unsure of what to show off, with walls of glass opening up to Sydney\u2019s big blue sky and shimmering harbor. \u201cThe in-between spaces are as important as the gallery spaces,\u201d said Brand, as he stood in the wide open middle of the structure. \u201cIt\u2019s a museum and a building that can only be in Sydney,\u201d he added. \u201cBoth through our collection and through the architecture.\u201d\n\nDozens of cities have tried to create their own marriages of art, architecture and landscape as part of a global museum building boom that began in the \u201990s with Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim in Bilbao. The new Whitney, with its huge floor-to-ceiling views of the High Line and the Hudson River, and the Louvre\u2019s new Arabic-galactic outpost in Abu Dhabi, on the edge of the Persian Gulf, are among the latest prominent additions. But the Sydney Modern, which doubles the exhibition space of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, one of Australia\u2019s most important art institutions, faces an especially acute cultural challenge. Museum building in a real-estate obsessed city that Mark Twain called \u201csuperbly beautiful\u201d \u2014 in the sunny heart of a proud \u201csporting nation\u201d \u2014 often requires overcoming a barrage of negativity. The Sydney Opera House was loathed before it was loved, and the Modern has traveled a rough road already.\n\nSome critics, including a former prime minister, have been condemning the project from the very beginning, mostly for grabbing valuable green space. Others have taken to calling the completed building, which opened on Dec. 3, an ugly and expensive set of boxes stacked on a stunning hillside. Echoing a common refrain, Judith White, an artist and former head of the Art Gallery Society, the gallery\u2019s nonprofit membership arm, said a harbor view through glass is a step down. \u201cIt\u2019s what corporate offices and the homes of the wealthy have,\u201d she said.\n\nThe project\u2019s price tag is far from exorbitant \u2014 it\u2019s in line with average costs per square meter for cultural infrastructure in the region, according to AEA Consulting, a global strategy and planning firm. But Sydney\u2019s elites, said Ross Gibson, a professor of Creative and Cultural Research at the University of Canberra, have a long history of underinvesting in cultural ambition while demanding quantifiable returns. \u201cMost of the rulers and commentators really do believe that \u2018culture\u2019 is a nonessential or luxury additive rather than part of the educational, civic, ethical and moral systems whereby a society might govern its core values and activities,\u201d he said. In practice, Brand and his team say they want to balance a respect for traditional Sydney with a touch of provocation. They know their shiny newcomer of a museum must satisfy staid officials first: admission is free; the state of New South Wales covers the gallery\u2019s operating budget. But the expansion, coupled with curatorial overhauls in the older building, also aims to make people see Australia\u2019s largest city with fresh eyes \u2014 as a cultural hub with deep Indigenous roots and close ties to its Asian neighbors, looking less to Europe or America for validation. Brand, an Australian art historian who previously served as director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, calls the complex, with its new building, \u201ca continuation of Sydney.\u201d For its early adopter fans, the Modern represents something far more jarring and worth celebrating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so open, it\u2019s so welcoming, it feels like a playground,\u201d said David Galafassi, 44, a doctor and a musician who had come for the day with his family. \u201cIt\u2019s all the things that we\u2019ve been missing.\u201d The new addition is certainly distinct from the museum\u2019s original neoclassical building, finished in 1909, which sits next door. Shorter in stature, with no grand facade, the Modern\u2019s first impression is almost airport-like \u2014 a square of glass with a metal ceiling. Inside, there\u2019s more warmth and fluidity. The entry\u2019s design points to the Yiribana Gallery of Aboriginal art, which has been elevated from a lower floor of the original building, and it offers an expansive view of landscaped terraces and sloping walkways. The pinkish, speckled concrete floor curves slightly downward, toward the galleries.\n\nMany of the curators acknowledged that like the slope itself, they are trying to nudge visitors toward a less rigid experience. The first exhibitions mostly provide a sampling of the gallery\u2019s collection, under a guiding principal of ignoring strict chronology and putting international and Australian art together in spaces that encourage meandering. In an exhibition titled \u201cDreamhome,\u201d a rounded-room installation with colorful beaded artwork and chairs from the American artist Jeffrey Gibson, a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and of Cherokee descent, sits within a few steps of three bright paintings from John Prince Siddon, a Walmajarri artist from the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia. Next to those, Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran, an Australian artist of Sri Lankan descent, has contributed a floor-to-ceiling stack of eerie 3-D creatures meant to inhabit an imaginary apartment block. Another exhibition space nearby \u2014 without an overarching theme \u2014 simply presents First Nations artists, like Roy Wiggan, a Bardi elder, near international giants, like the American painter Cy Twombly, and newer stars, such as the Korean conceptual artist Kimsooja.\n\nThe first piece to inhabit the tank, Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas\u2019s \u201cThe End of Imagination,\u201d defies time and the usual rules of museum interaction, featuring mammoth sculptures that can only be seen when lights from above move in the right direction. Darkness and the scent of industry fill the space until, suddenly, the artist\u2019s craggy constructions that speak to climate change, destruction and possible rebirth emerge from the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s not a human centric gaze,\u201d said Villar Rojas. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where you don\u2019t make decisions as a visitor. You can be like, \u2018OK, I want to go this way,\u2019 but maybe the lights will tell you something else.\u201d Brand, the director, sitting in his office overlooking an unfinished Indigenous garden installation that is the final piece of the Modern\u2019s puzzle, called the Tank and \u201cEnd of Imagination\u201d the perfect complement to what the Gallery hopes to create. \u201cThere\u2019s light, there\u2019s landscape, there\u2019s deep immersion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I've always had in mind for us to do.\u201d He paused as Sydney\u2019s summer sun brightened the room. \u201cI just hope everybody sees that.\u201d",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nINGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Since the College Football Playoff\u2019s inception, the Big 12 conference has generally been in the conversation but never good enough to make an appearance in the title game. There were the many Oklahoma teams: one led by Kyler Murray, who went to the Arizona Cardinals, and another led by the eventual Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, and yet another led by the Los Angeles Rams quarterback Baker Mayfield that all came up short in semifinals. There were other teams that were close to the playoff but fell short of being one of the four selectees. Texas Christian became the conference\u2019s unlikely hero this season as it soared to 13 wins, including one in the semifinal over Michigan, becoming the first Big 12 team to win a game in the playoff format. T.C.U. was facing Georgia in the final \u2014 a college football juggernaut \u2014 but seemed to perhaps have a chance with a unique defensive style, a Heisman finalist quarterback and one of the best receivers in the nation. But on Monday night, on the biggest stage and in one of the biggest games for the Big 12 in recent memory, T.C.U. suffered arguably the most embarrassing defeat in College Football Playoff history, losing, 65-7, in a game that was mostly not competitive.\n\nFor much of the game, it seemed as if Georgia\u2019s offense was playing a video game on the easiest difficulty level. Georgia bulldozed through T.C.U\u2019s linemen with ease. It forced T.C.U. quarterback Max Duggan into uncharacteristically bad throws, resulting in two bad interceptions. And T.C.U.\u2019s defense forced just one punt and looked confused with every Georgia drive. \u201cWe\u2019re not that kind of football team,\u201d said T.C.U. Coach Sonny Dykes. \u201cIf we make those mistakes, we\u2019re not going to win football games. We\u2019re certainly not going to be playing for a national championship.\u201d Dykes said that he sensed that his team was off on Monday night in the locker room ahead of the game, and had a feeling that there was a lot of \u201ctension\u201d and that his team seemed \u201cjust a little too fired up\u201d and \u201cmaybe a little too emotional.\u201d \u201cAnd as a result, you know, did some things that we don\u2019t normally do,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we were in the state of mind that we needed to be in, and we\u2019ve got to do a better job trying to get our players there. And obviously, we failed in that regard.\u201d For the past two weeks, Georgia had given some flashes of vulnerability. It allowed significant passing yardage to Ohio State and Louisiana State and squeaked by the Buckeyes in the semifinal because of Ohio State\u2019s missed field goal. And with its success in the air against Michigan, T.C.U. hoped but failed mightily to do the same against Georgia.\n\nT.C.U., uncharacteristically, was not the resilient team it had been all year. The Horned Frogs had won five games in comeback fashion, often down double digits, but on Monday night seemed to lie down as Georgia ran up the score. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really do anything special,\u201d T.C.U. linebacker Dee Winters said. \u201cWe kind of just beat ourselves up. They kind of just executed on our missed alignments and just kept scoring on those. You know, we just kept beating ourselves up, you know, just overthinking.\u201d Duggan, who finished second in voting for the Heisman Trophy, had his worst performance of the season. The struggles were not all his fault. He often faced pressure from Georgia defensive linemen bearing down on him as soon as he received the snap. Still, when there were opportunities to hit open receivers, Duggan routinely missed them. A prime example came in the second quarter, when Quentin Johnston ran down the middle of the field wide open, but Duggan overthrew him, the ball landing in the hands of Georgia defensive back Javon Bullard. \u201cI was making bad decisions, and I wasn\u2019t executing well,\u201d Duggan said, later adding, \u201cThey had some blitzes, some pressures they got through; I held on to the ball too long, wasn\u2019t getting through reads and was kind of causing trouble for the O-line myself.\u201d Although the playoff will expand to 12 teams in the 2024 season, the way T.C.U. lost this game will raise more questions and criticism about the seemingly huge gap between the top teams, especially those in the Southeastern Conference, and those in other leagues. After Kansas State beat T.C.U. in the Big 12 championship game, many clamored for Alabama to supplant the Horned Frogs in the playoff. Alabama then beat Kansas State in the Sugar Bowl by 25 points.",

Kathy Hochul delivered a State of the State speech on Tuesday that addressed what she said were the most pressing issues for New Yorkers.\n\nALBANY, N.Y. \u2014 Making crime and affordability the cornerstones of her State of the State address, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York on Tuesday sought to offer a road map to address the vexing and deep-rooted problems that are facing most metropolitan areas across the country, and are acutely felt in New York City. Many of her plans seemed squarely aimed at helping New York City navigate its pandemic-era recovery, as Mayor Eric Adams wrestles with residents\u2019 fears over street and subway crime, as well as a visible increase in New Yorkers who are homeless and mentally ill. Indeed, Ms. Hochul saved some of her loftiest rhetoric to describe her proposals to overhaul the state\u2019s approach to mental health, an issue championed by Mr. Adams, promising \u201ca monumental shift to make sure no one falls through the cracks.\u201d She said she would order hospitals to free up 850 inpatient psychiatric beds and enact changes to provide more care to people after they are discharged. Ms. Hochul, a Democrat who was elected to a full term in November, committed to hiring more prosecutors and proposed to give judges more latitude when setting bail, a move that seems likely to revive a bitter yearslong debate in Albany about criminal justice reforms.\n\nThe governor also promised to shore up the finances of New York City\u2019s subway system to avoid fare hikes and service reductions, and reiterated her support for converting office buildings in Manhattan, as well as currently illegal basements, into housing to address a dire shortage. She also tackled two other crises affecting the city, high rents and homelessness, unveiling an ambitious plan to build more than 800,000 new units of housing statewide over the next 10 years \u2014 twice what New York has built in the last decade. Even the front cover of the 277-page book outlining her policies was telling: It featured an outline of the city\u2019s skyline and major landmarks, but paid no similar homage to other regions of the state. The State of the State address was Ms. Hochul\u2019s first since winning a full term and becoming the first woman elected governor of New York. Indeed, the election, one of the closest New York governor\u2019s race in decades, cast a shadow over her agenda after Republicans made inroads last year by focusing on public safety and the state\u2019s high costs of living. \u201cIf New Yorkers don\u2019t feel safe in our communities, if they can\u2019t afford to buy a home or pay the rent, then the dream stays out of reach for them,\u201d Ms. Hochul told lawmakers gathered in the State Capitol\u2019s cavernous Assembly chamber during a 45-minute speech.\n\nTo help New Yorkers most affected by soaring prices, Ms. Hochul announced a plan to ensure the state\u2019s minimum wage kept pace with inflation, so that the lowest-paid workers would not continue to see their buying power diminish. Ms. Hochul offered other far-ranging commitments that could reverberate statewide. She vowed to expand access to child care. She doubled down on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And she sought to boost the agriculture industry by seeking to increase the percentage of local food products that state agencies must purchase. But the thrust of her address was undeniably crime and affordability, pressing themes that both Democrats and Republicans in Albany have already said will dominate this year\u2019s legislative session, and are likely to expose major rifts. On crime, Republicans, who are mostly powerless in the minority, are continuing to clamor for the repeal of the divisive changes Democrats made to the state\u2019s bail laws in 2019, an issue they amplified during last year\u2019s election as they sought to blame Democrats for a spike in crime. Ms. Hochul\u2019s decision to pursue further revisions to the laws seems likely to put her, as well as Mayor Adams, who has vocally pushed for changes, on a collision course with the more left-leaning factions of the State Legislature once again. (There was notably no applause from Democrats in the chamber when she said the bail laws had \u201croom for improvement.\u201d) Months before the pandemic disrupted life across the country, New York made all but the most serious crimes ineligible for bail. In those instances where bail was set, judges were instructed to use the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d means necessary to ensure defendants returned to court, and to avoid setting bail that a defendant would be unable to pay. Last session, Ms. Hochul secured a bevy of changes designed to tighten the bail laws, adding to the list of crimes eligible for bail as well as to the criteria judges were able to consider, while preserving the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d standard.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Hochul proposed lifting that standard in some cases, freeing judges to make their decisions based on factors like the seriousness of the charges and an individual\u2019s history of using a gun. The change would seem to implement a de facto \u201cdangerousness\u201d standard for bail-eligible crimes, while leaving in place a more lenient standard for less serious offenses. Ms. Hochul also said she would commit more than $36 million to hire hundreds of prosecutors to help process case backlogs around the state, and to address rises in violent crime as well as gun and property crime. The governor simultaneously put forth a far-reaching plan to tackle the dire shortage of housing statewide, but especially in New York City and its suburbs, where housing costs that are among the highest in the nation have contributed to a severe homelessness crisis. Ms. Hochul framed her housing plan as an imperative to lower costs, along with the number of people flocking to other states, blaming New York localities for imposing land-use regulations and construction bans she said were the \u201cmost restrictive in the nation.\u201d \u201cPeople want to live here, they have jobs here, but because of local decisions that limit growth, they cannot,\u201d Ms. Hochul said, name-checking other large cities building housing at a faster rate than New York City. \u201cLocal governments can and should make a difference.\u201d Taking cues from other states such as California, Ms. Hochul proposed that New York State play a more active role in shaping housing policy by coercing cities, towns and villages to ease restrictions that have stunted housing production. To meet the goal of 800,000 new units, Ms. Hochul is pushing for the construction of more housing around commuter rail and subway stations. She is also asking municipalities downstate to increase the number of homes by 3 percent over three years, a change that could make a big difference on Long Island, for example, which saw its number of new homes increase by just over half a percent between 2018 and 2020.\n\nHer proposal could spark tension. If a locality does not meet its state-imposed housing target, it may trigger a special process allowing developers to propose and build bigger buildings, even without the local government\u2019s approval. The state estimates these targets will allow for almost 150,000 new homes over the next decade. Ms. Hochul forecast that another 400,000 units could be constructed, in part, by passing a modified version of a contentious tax break for real estate developers that had helped spur the construction of rental housing in New York City but expired last year amid disagreements with Democrats who control the State Legislature. Ms. Hochul\u2019s proposals incorporate many of the goals of an ascendant pro-housing movement in New York, but could prove difficult to muscle through the Legislature, where some are likely to draw fierce resistance from local officials and the party\u2019s left wing. In the coming weeks, Ms. Hochul will release her state budget proposal, which will outline how much the governor\u2019s plans will cost. She will then have until April 1 to negotiate the state budget with lawmakers, a typically tense, back-room process of deal making during which most of Albany\u2019s policy battles are waged. This year, the governor will head into the negotiations already at odds with Democrats in the State Senate who have mounted a surprisingly forceful opposition to Ms. Hochul\u2019s nominee for chief judge of the state\u2019s highest court, raising the specter of a chaotic confirmation clash later this month. Citing dire forecasts about a potential recession, Ms. Hochul said on Tuesday that she would not look to increase income taxes, a move favored by a coalition of left-wing activists. But she vowed to help the city\u2019s public transit system tackle a budget crisis that had been triggered, in part, by a steep pandemic-era drop in ridership. To that end, Ms. Hochul said the state was about to move a major step closer to adopting a congestion-pricing program that would charge a toll as high as $23 to motorists who enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The fee, which would finance improvements to the transit network, will require final approval from the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.",

            "content": "A camera pans around Abegael Milot\u2019s bedroom. The floor is mostly invisible, hidden by piles of clothes. Four large plastic baskets are stacked on top of each other, some filled with laundry, others with electronics. There are eight abandoned cups of coffee on the desk and bedside table. On the floor lie two half-empty water bottles, a novelty bottle of tequila with a glass cactus inside, and a pet food dispenser. \u201cToday we\u2019re going to be cleaning my depression room,\u201d the 24-year-old YouTube star, who posts videos as Abbe Lucia, tells the camera. \u201cI fear that the only way that I will make myself clean this room is if I film it.\u201d The term \u201cdepression room\u201d is relatively new, popularized by videos on TikTok and YouTube that have accrued hundreds of millions of views. But experts have long recognized the link between messiness and mental health. The clutter that can accumulate when people are experiencing a mental health crisis is neither a form of hoarding, nor the result of laziness. The culprit is extreme fatigue, said N. Brad Schmidt, a distinguished research professor of psychology at Florida State University. People are \u201coftentimes just so mentally and physically exhausted that they don\u2019t feel like they have the energy to take care of themselves or their surroundings,\u201d Dr. Schmidt said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the capacity to engage with housecleaning and upkeep that they probably once did.\u201d\n\nA messy home can also contribute to feelings of overwhelm, stress and shame, making you feel worse than you already do. And while decluttering will not cure your depression, it can give you a mood boost. If you are struggling and it feels impossible to keep your surroundings tidy, here are a few tips on how to clean strategically to optimize your energy and your space. For KC Davis, a licensed professional counselor and author of the book \u201cHow to Keep House While Drowning,\u201d her clutter problem ballooned when her second child was born in early 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a messy person,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s always been functional.\u201d Suddenly faced with a new baby, postpartum depression and a pandemic, Ms. Davis realized that, without any systems in place, she was in over her head. While she worked to declutter her home, Ms. Davis started posting videos of her progress on TikTok, where she now has 1.5 million followers. Turned off by much of the self-help and cleaning content that has what she called \u201cboot camp messaging,\u201d she opted for a gentler, more pragmatic approach. Her systems are realistic about her capabilities and focus on having a livable space, not a spotless one. One of her most popular strategies is \u201cfive things tidying,\u201d the idea that there are only five things in any room: trash, dishes, laundry, things with a place and things without a place. Focusing on one category at a time keeps her from getting overwhelmed when it seems like there are a hundred different items that need to be put away. Ms. Davis is also a big advocate for what she calls \u201cclosing duties,\u201d inspired by her time working as a waitress. She often doesn\u2019t have the energy to clean her whole kitchen every evening, so she started doing just a few small tasks, \u201cas a kindness to future me to set myself up for success in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came away from this idea that it had to be all or nothing and just started thinking about function\u201d when it came to cleaning, she said. \u201cWhen I think about \u2018What do I need in the morning?\u2019 all of the sudden I can get specific.\u201d She makes sure she has enough clean dishes and counter space so that she can make breakfast, empties the trash and sweeps up any crumbs. \u201cWhat feels like this big, unending task is actually just 20 minutes of my day,\u201d she said. For people who are really struggling, Ms. Davis emphasized that things can be unsightly but shouldn\u2019t be unsanitary because everyone \u201cdeserves to be clean and comfortable.\u201d If you don\u2019t have the energy to wash all your dishes, clean just one or two for your next meal, or use paper plates. If laundry involves too many steps, don\u2019t worry about folding; wrinkles never hurt anybody. Make your home work better for you People who are neurodivergent, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (A.D.H.D.), autism or other executive functioning issues, also often struggle with excess clutter. Like \u201cdepression rooms,\u201d the term \u201cdoom piles\u201d has become popular on social media to describe the random stuff that builds up and you don\u2019t know what to do with. Nearly everyone has a junk drawer or two in their home, but these piles of clutter tend to be more ubiquitous for people who struggle with executive functioning. Lenore Brooks is an interior designer who specializes in working with people who are neurodivergent. When her sister, who has A.D.H.D., lived with her for a brief time, Ms. Brooks discovered that there were lots of resources to help children with A.D.H.D. or autism stay organized but virtually none targeted at adults. Much of Ms. Brooks\u2019s work revolves around helping her clients deal with seemingly endless clutter; they feel like they\u2019re constantly cleaning, but the clutter is always there. People with A.D.H.D. especially struggle with this because, she said, \u201cit\u2019s almost like decision fatigue all the time. \u2018I can\u2019t decide what to do with it, so I\u2019m just not going to do anything with it.\u2019\u201d The first step, Ms. Brooks said, is to really pay attention to the items that you\u2019re frequently cleaning up. Then find better places for them to live. \u201cWhat I talk to my clients about a lot is systems,\u201d she said. \u201cFiguring out why things are where they are, why clutter is building up where it is, and then changing the design or the organization around how people are actually using their home.\u201d These changes can be simple. For instance, if you find yourself constantly removing pens from your living-room couch cushions and coffee table, think about designating a spot to keep the pens in the room where you\u2019re actually using them. For a client whose home office was always filled with dirty dishes, Ms. Brooks got her a tray that she could load her tea and snack paraphernalia onto and return to the kitchen at the end of every day.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAmerica\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry rose last year, moving the nation in the opposite direction from its climate goals, according to preliminary estimates published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan research firm. Emissions ticked up 1.3 percent even as renewable energy surpassed coal power nationwide for the first time in over six decades, with wind, solar and hydropower generating 22 percent of the country\u2019s electricity compared with 20 percent from coal. Growth in natural gas power generation also compensated for coal\u2019s decline.\n\n\u201cWe are essentially on the same trajectory that we\u2019ve been on since the mid 2000s,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201clong-term structural decline,\u201d but one that\u2019s \u201cnot happening fast enough.\u201d\n\u2022 None Limits on Soot: The Biden administration The Biden administration proposed to tighten limits on a deadly air pollutant also known as soot responsible for thousands of premature deaths every year.\n\u2022 None Hunting Tactics: The National Park Service The National Park Service is moving to prohibit hunters on some public lands in Alaska from baiting black bears with doughnuts and invading wolf dens to kill pups.\n\u2022 None Wind Power: The United States will need thousands of wind farms to reach President Biden\u2019s ambitious climate goals. Rural counties have the land, The United States will need thousands of wind farms to reach President Biden\u2019s ambitious climate goals. Rural counties have the land, but will they go along\n\u2022 None Mail Trucks: In a win for the Biden administration, the United States Postal Service said it would spend nearly $10 billion to create In a win for the Biden administration, the United States Postal Service said it would spend nearly $10 billion to create one of the largest electric truck fleets in the nation Two years ago, President Biden promised to accelerate the pace, setting a goal of reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, an amount that is thought to be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Beyond that threshold, scientists say the risk of climate catastrophe, including life-threatening heat waves and food and water scarcity, increases significantly. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius over the past century. But the Rhodium Group\u2019s analysis suggests the country is not on track to meet Mr. Biden\u2019s target:\n\nThe recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate and tax law, is supposed to help bend the emissions curve closer to the 2030 goal, but even it is likely to fall short. The emissions estimate reflects a continued rebound from 2020 pandemic lows. The initial outbreak of the coronavirus triggered widespread lockdowns and slashed U.S. energy use to its lowest level in decades, with emissions plummeting more than 10 percent. They rebounded 6.2 percent in 2021 as the economy began to bounce back, but ongoing supply chain disruptions and new coronavirus variants dampened the recovery. The smaller rise in 2022 emissions came amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the resulting global energy crisis, and high inflation.\n\nEmissions from electric power generation fell as renewable energy and natural gas displaced coal, which saw a small and short-lived increase in 2021 because of high natural gas prices. Natural gas is less carbon-intensive than coal, but its production and distribution releases methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas. A recent report from the International Energy Agency estimated that renewables are on track to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation worldwide by early 2025, as countries respond to fossil fuel supply disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine by enacting stronger policies to shift away from carbon-emitting oil, gas and coal. Still, the United States made little progress last year in either of its highest-emitting sectors, transportation and industry, which together account for roughly two-thirds of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial emissions rose by 1.5 percent and transportation emissions rose by 1.3 percent, the latter driven mainly by demand for jet fuel as air travel continued to recover from pandemic-era declines. Some experts are hopeful that provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act can provide money to help speed decarbonization at industrial plants and reduce fossil fuel emissions from heavy industry, including cement and steel production. The legislation also expanded consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, which typically create fewer emissions than gasoline-powered cars. The most significant increase in emissions last year came from homes and buildings, which burn fossil fuels like natural gas in furnaces, hot water heaters and other appliances. Those emissions rose 6 percent, and reached prepandemic levels. Colder-than-average temperatures early in the year led many Americans to increase their home energy use by turning up the heat. The estimates from the Rhodium Group\u2019s sector by sector analysis do not include emissions from agriculture or from wildfires, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as they burn forests and grasslands. Agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, with farming activities accounting for 11.2 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2020, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

And a long-term relationship, by weight of \u2014 and we\u2019re not really even talking now about, you know, \u201cRethinking Sex,\u201d \u201cThe Right to Sex.\u201d The problem of connection, and how atomized people are these days, and the difficulty, particularly younger people are having, in finding each other and the paradox of choice \u2014 if there\u2019s too many different kinds of mustard in the mustard aisle at the grocery store, people walk down that aisle and don\u2019t get mustard, even if it was on their list, because they can\u2019t choose, and, really, the internet has created for many people that \u2014 and so it\u2019s not all people who feel low status, who feel cheated, who feel unmarketable for some reason. A lot of people who are, you know, in the mustard aisle of, like, dating apps, and want to pick a jar of mustard and would like to have mustard at home whenever they want it can\u2019t quite bring themselves to do it, and I think all of these problems and how we figure out how to address them are better problems to have than what people pine for, which are when women didn\u2019t have options, when women weren\u2019t legal adults, when women couldn\u2019t have credit cards or bank accounts or sign leases, when women were property, and a lot of men wound up in relationships with women who were there under duress, and we called that \u201cmarriage,\u201d right? And that\u2019s not the case anymore. And how do we control for that? How do we control for high-status men churning through as many women as they can get, just like high-status gay men used to be able to churn through a lot of male partners, and then how do we control for low status or low social skills? You know, when I talk to incels, and I\u2019ve talked to incels \u2014 I\u2019ve gotten on the phone with some people privately \u2014 you think of that movie, I think, \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d with Helen Hunt. It\u2019s about a sex worker going to see a profoundly physically disabled client, and everyone\u2019s like, oh, that\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s complicated, because we have weird, screwed-up feelings about sex work and whether it\u2019s legitimate, whether it\u2019s work or not, whether it should be legal or not, safe or not \u2014 that\u2019s the argument when it comes to the legality of sex work. It\u2019s not whether it\u2019s going to exist or not, or it\u2019s going to be safe, or riskier than all jobs are. And we recognize that, if somebody is profoundly physically disabled, that the attention and affection of a sex worker is a wonderful thing to be provided, sometimes even by family, to that person. Well, a lot of the incels that I\u2019ve actually spoken to are profoundly socially disabled. I think that disability, when somebody who has profound social disabilities sees a sex worker, we should be able to recognize that, that need for affection, that need for sex, this route to obtaining it and the improvement of the quality of life of that person, it\u2019s legitimate. It\u2019s legitimate. And it is a net good, and we should make that easier \u2014 not, you know, through federal subsidies, you know, the Department of Sex Work. We should make that easier by eliminating the stigma and giving people who do sex work or see sex workers the benefit of the doubt, and then also to recognize in people who see sex workers, to recognize ourselves, to recognize the ways in which, even in our own committed relationships, there are still these transactional elements. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not affection. Everyone I know who is a sex worker who has long-term clients, those are relationships of real, lasting affection. Those are long-term relationships. And yet we want to knock those relationships down to purely transactional; we want to call them crimes; and then we refuse to recognize in our own relationships the transactional elements that might help us empathize with people who have no other outlet except a sex worker.\n\nPeople know how to ask for what they want, you know, from a waiter. People know how to ask, often, for what they want from a sex worker. You know, one of the things, when it comes out, as it has, people who call me to write me, their partner was seeing a sex worker, and was doing with the sex worker, something they never asked the partner to do with them, and it was because they weren\u2019t afraid that the sex worker would leave them. And, usually, when people have a hard time communicating about sex, desire, intimacy, relationships, there\u2019s this fear of rejection, fear of being judged, fear of being left. Early in a relationship, you should embrace rejection, and you should run at that fear. You have to be willing to risk it. That\u2019s how you become a better communicator. You can\u2019t ask for what you want if you\u2019re not willing to risk losing what you have. And what you might risk losing is this person that you just met on an app that you\u2019re getting along with and you\u2019d like to see naked and you risk communicating, not in a, like, if you come home with me, we\u2019re gonna do four things from column A, four things from column B, and one thing from column C, but just, like, being actually who you are. In some ways, you have to straddle this creation of the Potemkin self, your best self, and your real self. You have to do both at the same time, and that can be difficult. And I\u2019m not trying to dodge your question here. It\u2019s just about disinhibiting around the fear of rejection \u2014 that, if this person isn\u2019t right for you, give them a chance. Allow them to give you a chance. There may be things that you don\u2019t agree on. You know, everything won\u2019t be on the menu, but so much is, and so much does work that, you know, you\u2019re willing to let go of some things and round them up. They\u2019re going to round you up. You\u2019re willing to pay certain prices of admission. But you have to be willing to risk rejection, and that\u2019s why people have a hard time communicating. So, if you were going to open the yellow pages in 1972 and try to find where to go to get strong, you look for the gym. You just have to \u2014 there\u2019s no willing-to-risk-rejection coach in the yellow pages, but that\u2019s what you have to be willing to do, and that\u2019s inside you. And that\u2019s really about prioritizing your needs, your comfort, what you want, and finding somebody who wants enough of what you want, and enough of what you are, and vise versa, that it would work out long term, which is not to say that \u2014 one of the things I like to talk about is that we overemphasize the importance or the primacy of long-term relationships. We have many more short-term relationships, and we should want those to be successes too. I don\u2019t think a relationship has to end with somebody in a box at a funeral home for it to have been a success, but death is our only standard of success. You know, a relationship is the only thing that we regard as a failure of everyone involved gets out alive. Imagine if we applied that standard to restaurants or flights, right? If it\u2019s a high-conflict relationship and a terrible divorce, and nobody can stand each other or speak to each other again, if there was abuse, emotional, physical, yeah, that relationship needed to end and was probably experienced as a failure, particularly by the person who was abused. If two people get out of a relationship and there\u2019s affection and respect, even a friendship, even if it ended, it was a success. And if we just looked at all of our relationships, we have so many short-term relationships, and we work so hard at making the L.T.R.s a success that we neglect making the S.T.R.s a success, and all an L.T.R. is an S.T.R. that worked out.",

            "content": "THE HALF KNOWN LIFE: In Search of Paradise, by Pico Iyer\n\nTen times over 12 years, Pico Iyer accompanied the Dalai Lama across Japan. Inevitably, at every large public gathering, someone would ask what to do after having been disappointed by a dream not realized. The dreams themselves differed \u2014 peace in the Middle East, a reversal of climate change or hope for a relationship \u2014 but the disillusionment was always the same.\n\n\u201cThe Half Known Life,\u201d with this vignette at its center, takes the Dalai Lama\u2019s sentiment to heart. How to reconcile our wishes and hopes with reality? Where does paradise really lie? What can a secular seeker learn from the world\u2019s holiest places? In Iyer\u2019s hands, the search for paradise, the way out of the ego, doubles as an internal journey. Skittering from the gardens of Iran\u2019s holiest mosques to the car-free streets of North Korea\u2019s capital, from the avenues of East Belfast to war-torn Kashmir\u2019s Dal Lake houseboats, from the outback of aboriginal Australia to the Ethiopian chapels of Jerusalem, from the empty moonscape of Ladakh to the massive stone Buddhas of Sri Lanka, from the graveyards of Japan\u2019s mountain temples to the burning ghats of Varanasi, this elliptical odyssey, graced with occasional notes of light, finds itself by dwelling in the shadows. The places we avoid, Iyer says, are \u201cso often closer to us than the ones we eagerly seek out.\u201d\n\nNo stranger to the travel genre, the prolific Iyer is after something more here. His chronicle, which begins with an appreciation of the sophistication, beauty and culture of Iran, becomes a requiem for a world \u2014 and an existence \u2014 estranged from itself. There are only two things he is afraid of, he tells us: serpents and heights; and there are plenty of both here, along with crypts, tombstones, graveyards, burning corpses and flickering lights, \u201can infinity of reflections\u201d in \u201ca treasure house of riddles.\u201d A lonely, nostalgic and haunted quality emerges as Iyer casually intersperses bits of his personal history. There is a formula to many of the chapters: He touches down in a new place, checks into a lodging and finds a taxi or guide to take him to the next site. We meet his drivers, listen to their surprising conversation and extract unexpected wisdom. \u201cThe writer\u2019s job,\u201d Iyer opines, \u201cis to dismantle the very notion of Other by showing how your hurts belong to me, as my hopes do to you.\u201d But empathy is not the only thing going on; Iyer is also looking within. And as he looks, things get dizzier and dizzier.\n\nIyer is not a Buddhist, but he has a Buddhist sensibility. Born in Oxford and educated in elite English boarding schools, he is a secular writer with an eye for the spiritual. His book has the soft ring of a classic Buddhist meditation strategy: In order to understand the emptiness of the ego, one must first find the self as it appears. This might sound easy, but in practice it is incredibly frustrating. The more one tries to zero in on the self, the more elusive it becomes. The process is often likened to a dog chasing its own tail \u2014 round and round you go until the very giddiness of the process whirls you into an unexpected understanding. \u201cThe Half Known Life\u201d brings this uncertainty to the fore. By the end of the book, Iyer wakes to a fog-drenched Varanasi, the holy Indian city of the dead. He can barely see 30 feet in front of him. Fires from burning bodies add smoke to the mist. We are in a \u201chalf known realm\u201d filled with \u201cghostly towers and palaces\u201d where the only paradise is a \u201ccandlelit back alleyway\u201d that shows the way home. Iyer references Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville as he gathers his conclusions; both writers inferred that \u201ca keen sense of all that could never be fathomed\u201d is the way to paradise.",

            "section": "Well",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nFrom hot toddies to chicken soup, there are a few important things to keep in mind, experts say.\n\nQ: What are the best foods or drinks to consume when I have a cold? If you search for the answers online, you will find plenty of articles claiming that certain \u201cimmune-boosting\u201d foods or drinks \u2014 like garlic, citrus, cranberries, chili pepper and pomegranate juice \u2014 can ease symptoms or speed recovery from a common cold. But \u201cwe do not have strong enough information suggesting that everyone should be eating specific foods during a viral infection,\u201d said Colleen Tewksbury, an assistant professor in nutrition science at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. That said, it\u2019s important to feed yourself well, Dr. Tewksbury said. A cold \u2014 especially if it affects your sense of taste and smell \u2014 can squelch your appetite, yet your body still needs calories and nutrients to function and fight the infection, she said. \u201cAnything you can do that will help you feel a bit more comforted and meet some of your nutritional needs during that time will be helpful.\u201d Dr. Tewksbury suggested turning to hydrating and nourishing foods and drinks that are also comforting, such as the ones you were given when you were sick as a child or those grounded in your cultural traditions.\n\nSoup is soothing, and backed by a bit of science \u201cSoup tends to be a good go-to,\u201d Dr. Tewksbury said \u2014 especially if it includes a healthy balance of nutrients, including protein (like beans or chicken), carbohydrates (rice, noodles or potatoes), some fat (from meat, oils or dairy) and \u201cveggies that will pack in some additional vitamin and mineral punches.\u201d Soup is \u201cfilling, it\u2019s nourishing, it helps with fluid intake,\u201d Dr. Tewksbury said. And in fact, said Dr. Stephen Rennard, a professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, there\u2019s a little bit of lab-based science to back it up. In 2000, Dr. Rennard and his team published a study that investigated how chicken soup affects the body\u2019s neutrophils, immune cells that travel to the site of infection and initiate inflammation, contributing to symptoms like sore throat and cough. In the lab, the researchers placed neutrophils in small plastic wells and added a substance that usually attracts them, similar to what happens during an infection. But when the cells were bathed in chicken soup, they didn\u2019t migrate nearly as much toward the substance. In theory, Dr. Rennard said, this reduced neutrophil movement could translate to lower inflammation and fewer symptoms. But cells in a lab dish can\u2019t explain what, if anything, happens to cells in a body. And understanding how \u2014 or even if \u2014 chicken soup might influence cold symptoms requires expensive and time-consuming clinical trials, which haven\u2019t been done, Dr. Rennard said.\n\nStill, Dr. Rennard believes in the therapeutic value of chicken soup, which has been a recommended remedy for hundreds of years. He thinks that some of chicken soup\u2019s benefits may stem from the emotional, rather than physical, experience. If \u201csomebody makes you some chicken soup, especially if you really like the way it tastes, you\u2019re going to feel better because they\u2019re taking care of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s independent of whether there\u2019s any medicinal activities in the soup.\u201d\n\nIn the study, Dr. Rennard used a recipe from the family of his wife, Barbara, who was also a co-author: It calls for a whole chicken simmered with carrots, celery, parsnips, onions, turnips and sweet potatoes, served with matzo balls. Dr. Rennard also tested 13 canned or instant soups in the study, including a few vegetarian options, and most slowed the movement of neutrophils to some degree. A couple of small human studies have also suggested that sipping soup or a hot drink, even just hot water, can help loosen nasal mucus and make breathing feel easier. And of course, any liquid provides fluids, and \u201chydration makes it easier to clear secretions,\u201d Dr. Rennard said. Multiple randomized controlled trials have found that honey can reduce the frequency and severity of nighttime coughing in children, in some cases better than over-the-counter cough syrups. There\u2019s less research among adults, but a systematic review published in 2020 suggested that honey\u2019s benefits may extend to other age groups. It\u2019s not clear how honey helps to quell a cough, but researchers have hypothesized that its throat-coating, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties may contribute. Don\u2019t give honey to infants who are younger than 12 months old, though, because it might contain bacteria that can cause a serious condition called infant botulism. For children older than 1 year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving half to one teaspoon of honey as needed; eat it right out of the spoon or stir into a cup of hot tea. Some cold sufferers may seek comfort in a hot toddy, which traditionally includes a splash of whiskey and honey in hot water. But keep in mind that drinking alcohol when you\u2019re also taking medications for cold, cough and allergy symptoms can be dangerous, especially if the medications include acetaminophen, which can cause liver damage if mixed with alcohol, Dr. Tewksbury warned.\n\nAlcohol can also be dehydrating, and though there isn\u2019t much research on this point, it stands to reason that drinking while sick with a virus might worsen how you feel, Dr. Tewksbury added. That being said, if a hot toddy is what you\u2019re craving when you have the sniffles and you\u2019re not taking any medications that will negatively interact with alcohol, Dr. Tewksbury said she wouldn\u2019t discourage mixing up a drink. Just remember that it probably won\u2019t help you heal any quicker. You can also make a nonalcoholic hot toddy using tea instead of liquor and adding flavor with honey, lemon, ginger or other spices. Many people believe that drinking cow\u2019s milk increases mucus production, but research testing this belief is limited, with mixed results. Several Australian studies published in the 1990s found no link between milk drinking and mucus, including among people infected with a common cold virus. Yet in a recent trial of 108 adults who didn\u2019t have colds but who suffered from chronic overproduction of mucus, researchers found that those following a dairy-free diet for six days had reduced self-reported snot secretions. \u201cThere is little evidence that dairy universally increases mucus production for everyone,\u201d Dr. Tewksbury said. But this may vary from person to person, so if dairy makes you feel phlegmy, avoiding it when you have a cold is reasonable, she said. Otherwise, dairy products can be a convenient and balanced source of nutrition. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends blending frozen fruit with milk (or soy milk) for a nutritious and hydrating smoothie for children when they are sick. In the end, \u201cfood is so personal,\u201d Dr. Tewksbury said. When you\u2019re feeling flattened by a cold, she suggested asking yourself: \u201cWhat are the things that can help me feel most nourished during this time, to help support myself? And that\u2019s different for everybody.\u201d",

            "content": "FLORA MACDONALD: \u201cPretty Young Rebel\u201d: Her Life and Story, by Flora Fraser\n\nLast year marked the 300th anniversary of the birth of Flora Macdonald, the highland heroine who in 1746 helped Prince Charles Edward Stuart (\u201cBonnie Prince Charlie\u201d) to escape British forces in an open boat \u201cover the sea to Skye,\u201d following the tragic defeat of the Jacobite army at Culloden, Scotland \u2014 and the end of the exiled House of Stuarts\u2019 efforts to restore the family to the British throne.\n\nFor more than two and a half centuries Flora\u2019s story has captured the popular imagination in novels, poems, songs and films, much of the retelling distorted to satisfy the public\u2019s appetite for romance. In the process the real Flora Macdonald has been buried under myths and half-truths that reflect the enduring trope of a tenderhearted young woman who shows mettle in the face of danger. In \u201cFlora Macdonald: \u2018Pretty Young Rebel\u2019: Her Life and Story,\u201d her well-researched and enthusiastic biography, Flora Fraser recounts Macdonald\u2019s life based on facts culled from published and archival sources on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe book opens in the Western Isles of Scotland in the summer of 1746, where the fugitive Prince Charles had been evading British government troops since late April. In mid-June he was presented with a daring plan: He would be smuggled off the islands to the Isle of Skye disguised as a maidservant. His protector would be a young woman, Flora Macdonald, whose stepfather, Hugh, probably planned the escape, and certainly suggested it to the prince. Hugh Macdonald was no Jacobite \u2014 he was a captain of a pro-British government militia \u2014 yet he called himself a \u201cfriend in his heart\u201d to Prince Charles. Like many Scotsmen, he had not \u201ccome out\u201d for the prince in the rebellion of 1745, in which a Jacobite army had mustered under the Stuart royal standard, entered Edinburgh and gone on to invade England, getting as far south as Derby before turning back. But if he had not joined the rebellion, Hugh nevertheless did not wish the prince to be captured on the Macdonalds\u2019 home turf.\n\nFlora knew nothing of her stepfather\u2019s scheme when the prince arrived at her shieling on the night of June 20, 1746. The dramatic scene in which she was persuaded by the prince and his companions to take part in the dangerous enterprise has been told many times. Fraser shows that Flora was initially reluctant, and contrary to some popularized versions of events she was not acting alone: Her stepfather provided the passes to permit Flora to cross over to Skye with her maidservant, \u201cBetty Burke\u201d; her kinswoman Lady Clanranald helped Flora to sew the enormous gown that was Charles\u2019s disguise; the famous overnight journey by boat in late June included Flora, the prince and six other men.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been going on seven years since the team at the Gjelina Group in Venice, Calif., first toyed with the notion of opening a New York branch. It finally happened on Dec. 31. \u201cI think it turned out for the best,\u201d said the chief executive Shelley Armistead. She was taking a brief break from waiting tables in the restaurant\u2019s upstairs dining room; she pitches in from time to time. The restaurant serves only breakfast and lunch, no reservations. Ms. Armistead cited the pandemic, construction and permits for the delays; dinner was not planned right out of the gate, and will not be served until more staff is trained. \u201cBut when you serve breakfast, you attract the neighborhood, not Instagram followers,\u201d she said. The two-story, 120-seat space has a cafe area in front and a bright, rustic bare-table dining room with an open kitchen, bar and counter beyond. Upstairs, you\u2019ll find two polished dining rooms and a bar with plush mohair banquettes and a sunny front area. In Los Angeles, the Gjelina Group has a bakery, a takeout shop and other retail venues, some of which Ms. Armistead is hoping to transport to New York. Ms. Armistead described the Gjelina Group as a \u201ccollective of 550 people,\u201d taking the approach that they give as much financial support as possible directly to suppliers, like farmers, anglers, weavers, ceramists and flower cultivators. A collaborative menu helmed by Juan Hernandez consists of largely produce-driven specialties like lemon buckwheat ricotta pancakes, a frittata with leeks and herbs, and Moroccan baked eggs with merguez for breakfast; oysters, lamb tartare, smoked mackerel with arugula, roasted arrowhead cabbage in bagna cauda, einkorn pappardelle with brisket, duck confit with red cabbage, and 10 inventive pizzas, including one with mixed mushrooms and garlic confit. On the list of desserts is an apple clafoutis and buttermilk panna cotta with tahini. Wines, cocktails, beers and juices are poured.\n\nThe Toms, Tom Lei and Tom Lo, who own Spy C Chinese restaurant in Forest Hills, Queens, have opened this new place in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, also featuring Sichuan food. It has a tailored look with Chinese detailing and is fairly spacious: 150 seats and three private dining rooms. The menu is vast, with more than a dozen categories. You\u2019ll find appetizers, dim sum, small plates like Korean spicy chicken wings and crisp beef tendon with caviar, and Sichuan cuisine, including dried pepper Dungeness crab, mala boneless pork trotters and Chongqing spicy chicken. Among the categories are \u201ctastes from different provinces,\u201d including lobster in preserved egg sauce, and American Chinese selections, like sweet and sour pork and General Tso\u2019s chicken. There are also rices, noodles, vegetables and desserts.\n\nIn the space that was Toriko, a yakitori specialist, there\u2019s now seasonal contemporary fare, sometimes elevated with items like an uni tartlet, celeriac dauphinoise and a $75 curried lobster dish. The food is by Nate Ashton, a former chef de cuisine at Mimi in Greenwich Village. His other specialties include spaetzle with honey nut squash; duck; and Berkshire pork ribs. The owner, Gabby Madden, has filled the room with her personal artwork, dishes and other items. (Opens Wednesday)\n\nMatthew Lief, Michael Felix and Maria Dela Cruz, the chefs who ran Landhaus in Berg\u2019n, the now-closed collection of dining stalls in Crown Heights, are opening this stand-alone tavern. Alongside draft beers, wines by the glass and $10 happy-hour cocktails, they\u2019re serving the maple-glazed thick-cut bacon for which they became known, a spicy fried chicken sandwich, fish and chips, a burger, an elote dip and a few salads.

Trump tweeted, \u201cSHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!\u201d His attorney general later authorized prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to seek Mr. Saipov\u2019s execution if he was convicted.\n\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers last year asked the Justice Department under President Biden to withdraw the death penalty request, but Attorney General Merrick B. Garland refused. On Monday, Mr. Saipov\u2019s lawyer, David E. Patton, the city\u2019s federal public defender, took a surprising tack in his opening statement, admitting that his client, an Uzbek immigrant, had driven the truck down the bike path, causing the deaths and injuries. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident \u2014 he did it intentionally.\u201d Mr. Patton said. \u201cMr. Saipov caused unimaginable pain and suffering,\u201d Mr. Patton told the jury. \u201cThere is no excuse for what he did, and we will not offer one to you.\u201d But he disputed the government\u2019s assertion that Mr. Saipov carried out the attack in order to join ISIS, an Islamist terrorist group that once held sway over large areas in Iraq and Syria and has pledged to create a new Muslim caliphate. He portrayed his client, who moved to the United States in 2010 at the age of 22 and worked as a long-haul truck driver, as having become caught up in ISIS propaganda. Mr. Patton said he spent many hours consuming ISIS audio and videos and immersing himself in its violent messaging, social media and chat groups.\n\nProsecutors have said that a cellphone found in Mr. Saipov\u2019s truck contained about 90 videos, many of which were ISIS-related, including fighters shooting and beheading prisoners and instructions for making a homemade explosive device. The phone also contained 3,800 images, including many of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then ISIS\u2019s leader. Mr. Li, in his opening statement, said the evidence would show that Mr. Saipov, who lived in Paterson, N.J., drove the truck into Manhattan and headed south on the West Side Highway. As he neared Houston Street, he pulled onto the bike path and almost immediately began plowing into victims. He slammed into one group of 10 friends from Argentina, who were riding bicycles in pairs. \u201cThe defendant struck and killed every single rider on the left side of the column,\u201d Mr. Li said. As Mr. Saipov drove faster and faster, Mr. Li said, he killed two more people, driving over one man and crushing his body and hitting another, sending his body flying into the air. As he raced his truck down the path, he crashed into the side of a school bus. Inside were two children and two adults, including the driver. One of the children suffered serious brain damage, Mr. Li said.\n\nOf the eight people killed in the attack, six were tourists: the five from Argentina and one from Belgium. The other victims were a 23-year-old software engineer from Manhattan and a 32-year-old financial worker from a New Jersey suburb. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, the authorities have said. Mr. Saipov\u2019s attack was one of a number of terrorist attacks around the world in 2016 and 2017, when ISIS encouraged its followers to \u201cact where you are,\u201d said Mr. Patton, the defense lawyer. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a truck attack in Nice, France, in 2016 that left 86 people dead on the national Bastille Day holiday, but a French judge said there was no evidence of a link. The Manhattan judge, Vernon S. Broderick, told the jury that the trial could last three months. The 12 jurors first will consider whether Mr. Saipov is guilty of the charges, and if they reach that verdict, they will decide whether he should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death.\n\nMr. Saipov sat quietly in court on Monday between two of his lawyers. He wore a green jacket and a white mask that did not fully cover his scraggly beard. Mr. Saipov turned halfway back in his chair once the jury was dismissed for the lunch break, appearing to glance at the spectators seated behind him. Mr. Patton, the defense lawyer, told the jury that his client had been held in solitary confinement since his arrest. In the government\u2019s opening statement, Mr. Li told jurors that after Mr. Saipov was arrested, he was treated at Bellevue Hospital, where \u201che was eager to speak with the F.B.I.\u201d He said he was \u201cproud of his attack,\u201d Mr. Li said, that his goal was to kill as many people as possible, and he even asked to display an ISIS flag in his hospital room. A few days later, ISIS issued an announcement that Mr. Saipov had become a soldier of the caliphate and claimed responsibility for the attack, he said.\n\nOne expert, Daniel C. Richman, a criminal law professor at Columbia Law School and former federal prosecutor, said if the jury finds that the government \u201chas not satisfied an element of the crime, they need to acquit on those charges.\u201d Mr. Richman said that since motivation is a critical element of certain charges, \u201cthe defense is setting up the argument that this was not somebody fixated on joining an actual terrorist enterprise.\u201d Even if the jury does convict, he added, the defense might seek to argue as a mitigating factor in the death penalty phase that Mr. Saipov\u2019s attack was motivated more by ISIS propaganda than by any desire to become a member of the organization. On Monday, as the prosecutor described the New York attack, many spectators in the gallery appeared tearful, leaning on each other for support. One woman wiped her eyes with a tissue. Some wore headsets that had been handed out to victims and their relatives who had come from overseas to provide a translation of the proceedings. One woman holding a headset held a laminated photo of a young man who was killed during the attack. A white bandanna was spread out on the bench near her, which read: \u201cQue el amor venza al odio\u201d \u2014 Spanish for \u201cmay love defeat hate.\u201d",

            "content": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brasil \u2014 Uma na\u00e7\u00e3o chocada assistiu ao vivo, pela TV e pelas redes sociais, milhares de apoiadores radicais de um presidente derrotado marcharem at\u00e9 a sede do governo federal, convencidos de que a elei\u00e7\u00e3o foi roubada. A turba saqueou o Congresso, o Supremo Tribunal Federal e o Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto. As autoridades levaram v\u00e1rias horas para prender centenas de pessoas e finalmente restaurar a ordem. Espera-se que tenha sido o \u00faltimo ato dos bolsonaristas, apoiadores extremistas do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro, que j\u00e1 foi apelidado de \u201cTrump dos Tr\u00f3picos\u201d. Ainda assim, tal como ocorreu com o ataque dos apoiadores do ex-presidente Donald Trump ao Capit\u00f3lio em 6 de janeiro, n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se este \u00e9 o fim de um movimento pol\u00edtico ou apenas o in\u00edcio de mais polariza\u00e7\u00e3o e caos. O novo presidente, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, j\u00e1 enfrentava o dif\u00edcil desafio de unir um pa\u00eds dividido, mesmo que sem a presen\u00e7a de um ex-presidente bomb\u00e1stico, rec\u00e9m-sa\u00eddo de cena, e com muitos de seus eleitores agora propensos \u00e0 viol\u00eancia. Levar os respons\u00e1veis pelo ataque \u00e0 Justi\u00e7a \u00e9 um ponto essencial por onde come\u00e7ar. Em 1o de janeiro, Lula assumiu o terceiro mandato como presidente do Brasil em uma cerim\u00f4nia de posse na capital \u2014 mas Bolsonaro n\u00e3o compareceu. Ele deveria passar a faixa presidencial para Lula como s\u00edmbolo de uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o pac\u00edfica de poder. Em vez disso, preferiu passar os \u00faltimos dias de sua presid\u00eancia e as primeiras semanas da gest\u00e3o de Lula em Orlando, na Fl\u00f3rida, em uma casa pr\u00f3xima ao parque Disney World.\n\nAinda assim, no per\u00edodo ap\u00f3s a derrota, muitos apoiadores de Bolsonaro acamparam em frente a bases militares em todo o pa\u00eds, imaginando que o ex-presidente iria implementar um plano de \u00faltima hora. \u201cA gente n\u00e3o sabe data, a gente n\u00e3o sabe o qu\u00ea, a gente n\u00e3o sabe onde, a gente s\u00f3 confia no nosso presidente\u201d, uma das manifestantes me disse. No fim das contas, nada aconteceu, ent\u00e3o alguns membros da turba tentaram agir por conta pr\u00f3pria. Nos \u00faltimos dois anos, Bolsonaro tem repetido infundadas alega\u00e7\u00f5es de que o sistema eleitoral poderia ser manipulado. Quando ele disse que havia apenas tr\u00eas alternativas para o futuro \u2014 estar preso, ser morto ou a vit\u00f3ria \u2014, ele esqueceu de mencionar uma quarta op\u00e7\u00e3o: ir comer frango frito nos Estados Unidos, algo que o fotografaram fazendo no come\u00e7o do m\u00eas. Afinal, n\u00e3o havia os componentes necess\u00e1rios para uma insurrei\u00e7\u00e3o bem-sucedida. O presidente derrotado n\u00e3o tinha o respaldo institucional nem o apoio p\u00fablico de que necessitava para induzir os militares a assumirem seu lado. Para come\u00e7ar, faltavam-lhe aliados. Logo que a derrota eleitoral de Bolsonaro foi anunciada, alguns de seus correligion\u00e1rios parabenizaram o novo presidente eleito. Outros presidentes latino-americanos fizeram o mesmo. As congratula\u00e7\u00f5es de Joe Biden vieram mais tarde, na pr\u00f3pria noite da elei\u00e7\u00e3o, e foram anunciadas pela m\u00eddia brasileira como uma significativa confirma\u00e7\u00e3o da lisura do processo eleitoral. E o que \u00e9 mais importante, a derrota de Bolsonaro provocou um clamor entre seus eleitores bem menor do que se temia \u2014 ainda que tenha havido tumulto. Milhares de seus apoiadores bloquearam estradas e incendiaram ve\u00edculos, na tentativa de paralisar o pa\u00eds. Centenas de outros decidiram montar tendas diante de quart\u00e9is e outras edifica\u00e7\u00f5es militares por todo o territ\u00f3rio, clamando por uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o militar no governo. \u201cS.O.S. For\u00e7as Armadas\u201d, eles gritavam, por vezes alternando palavras de ordem belicosas com ave-marias e o Hino Nacional. Algumas semanas depois, todas as estradas estavam liberadas. Alguns acampamentos permaneceram, incluindo um no bairro de Santana, em minha cidade, S\u00e3o Paulo. No Natal, passei parte da tarde conversando com uma d\u00fazia de apoiadores de Bolsonaro que ocupavam o local. Eles ainda acreditavam que as elei\u00e7\u00f5es haviam sido fraudadas. A evid\u00eancia mais forte vinha em forma de pergunta: \u201cSe est\u00e1 todo mundo aqui, por que a minoria venceu?\u201d.\n\nEles insistiam que Lula n\u00e3o assumiria o poder no dia 1o de janeiro. \u201cA gente tem convic\u00e7\u00e3o de que ele n\u00e3o vai\u201d, declarou uma mulher de aproximadamente 70 anos. (As pessoas com quem conversei n\u00e3o quiseram fornecer seus nomes por quest\u00f5es de seguran\u00e7a.) Quando perguntei o que poderia acontecer, a mulher sugeriu dois poss\u00edveis desenlaces: ou os militares seriam acionados para apoiar um golpe do presidente \u2014 assim como os bolsonaristas desejavam \u2013 ou os \u201ccidad\u00e3os de bem\u201d tomariam as ruas \u2014 tamb\u00e9m seguindo supostas instru\u00e7\u00f5es de Bolsonaro \u2014 para garantir que ele permanecesse no poder. O governo Lula, formado por uma frente ampla de for\u00e7as democr\u00e1ticas, ir\u00e1 conduzir o pa\u00eds ao comunismo, me disseram os manifestantes. \u00c9 por isso que eles pediram uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o militar enquanto interpretavam as poss\u00edveis mensagens secretas que o presidente lhes mandou em C\u00f3digo Morse. (Sim, eles passaram um tempo tentando decifrar as batucadas de Bolsonaro na mesa durante sua \u00faltima live nas redes sociais.) A verdade \u00e9 que o capital pol\u00edtico de Bolsonaro definhou. Quando ele deixou o pa\u00eds, seu vice-presidente, o general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, disse \u00e0 na\u00e7\u00e3o: \u201cA altern\u00e2ncia do poder em uma democracia \u00e9 saud\u00e1vel e deve ser preservada\u201d. Ele tamb\u00e9m fez uma franca refer\u00eancia a \u201clideran\u00e7as que deveriam tranquilizar e unir a na\u00e7\u00e3o em torno de um projeto de pa\u00eds\u201d, e que em vez disso fomentaram um clima de caos e desagrega\u00e7\u00e3o social. Essa doeu. Parece que at\u00e9 as For\u00e7as Armadas almejam apenas uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o de poder tranquila, para que possam continuar sendo uma classe privilegiada sem maiores responsabilidades. Alguns dos antigos aliados de Bolsonaro no Congresso agora apoiam Lula. O \u00cdndice de Popularidade Digital do ex-presidente, calculado por uma empresa de consultoria, caiu para menos da metade de seu \u00e1pice. Mas os bolsonaristas radicais n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o cair em sil\u00eancio. Apenas nesta segunda-feira eles retiraram as tendas da frente dos quart\u00e9is e instala\u00e7\u00f5es militares em S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e outras cidades. Em Bras\u00edlia, as autoridades desmontaram o acampamento e detiveram 1.200 pessoas. Os manifestantes passaram mais de dois meses esperando um milagre acontecer. Quando n\u00e3o houve nada, tentaram tomar o governo \u00e0 for\u00e7a. Em resposta, Lula assinou um decreto de emerg\u00eancia permitindo a interven\u00e7\u00e3o do governo federal para restaurar a ordem na capital. A medida ter\u00e1 efeito at\u00e9 o fim do m\u00eas. O governador do Distrito Federal foi temporariamente afastado por um juiz do STF. Uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o criminal foi aberta para identificar os insurgentes e seus financiadores. Na segunda-feira, uma deputada pediu que o governo requisitasse a extradi\u00e7\u00e3o de Bolsonaro. As democracias precisam do estado de direito para prosperar. Tamb\u00e9m precisam da compreens\u00e3o m\u00fatua de que o poder deve ser transferido de forma pac\u00edfica. Lula tem a dif\u00edcil miss\u00e3o de manter coesa uma na\u00e7\u00e3o. Um bom ponto de partida ser\u00e1 manter a calma ap\u00f3s eventos t\u00e3o deplor\u00e1veis e observar com firmeza os ritos da Justi\u00e7a, a fim de responsabilizar os culpados.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nKevin McCarthy\u2019s grueling struggle to become speaker of the House of Representatives was mostly an embarrassment for him and his new Republican majority. Yet among the fumbling and chaos, you could catch glimpses of how the House could improve itself \u2014 that is, if party factions advance structural reforms. Such promise is not easily seen in a lot of what happened last week. Some of the Freedom Caucus members who were holdouts on Mr. McCarthy seemed to see themselves less as legislators bargaining toward policy outcomes and more as commentators hurling outrage at the very institution they worked so hard to join. Others, however, entered the fight with valid complaints about the overcentralization of power in the House. As Mr. McCarthy worked to win their votes, it became clear that genuine structural change can be achieved by applying leverage at the right moments. Mr. McCarthy offered a number of hollow concessions. For example, lowering the threshold for a new vote for speaker matters little, since members wouldn\u2019t seek such a vote if they didn\u2019t think a significant number of their colleagues would support it.\n\nBut he also committed to advancing discrete spending bills rather than another massive omnibus, like the one in December, restoring something of the order of the budget process. And he proved willing to cut into the core of the speaker\u2019s authority by surrendering control over some seats on the crucial House Committee on Rules. That committee determines how bills will be taken up on the floor, how much time they will get and whether and what sorts of amendments will be allowed. It is more skewed toward the majority party than the other House committees and has been under the thumbs of House speakers for decades. Surrendering seats on that committee to a faction of the party is an extraordinary and highly consequential concession. It may matter more as a model for future factional negotiations than for its immediate effect. In the current House, Republicans have an exceedingly narrow majority and do not have the option of deferring to a president and Senate majority of their party. This divided Congress is therefore unlikely to advance major legislation and will need some foresight and luck even to avoid a disastrous debt-ceiling crisis. But frustrated legislators of both parties can draw a crucial lesson: A determined group of members that picks its moment well can drive meaningful institutional change if it holds together and shares a vision of a less consolidated Congress. Observers of today\u2019s Congress tend to think that the party coalitions are too fractious and that the institution is too unwieldy. But the opposite is closer to the truth: Each party is now too cohesive to allow for much meaningful negotiation within or between the parties over substantive policy priorities.\n\nThe exceptions prove the rule. For instance, in the last Congress, Democrats expressed no end of outrage at the modest heresies of Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Yet it was only such departures from party orthodoxy that permitted the modest bipartisan legislative achievements \u2014 like the infrastructure bill \u2014 of that Congress. A broader congressional majority would need more such internal diversity, not less. Both chambers of Congress are much too tightly controlled by party leaders to enable the kind of policy negotiation that the institution was intended to foster. Major decisions are made by the so-called four corners \u2014 the leaders of each party in each chamber \u2014 and most members are left with too few legislative outlets for their energies. The highest purpose of Congress is not to advance the favored legislation of either party\u2019s activists but to enable representatives of an always fractious society to address public problems by negotiating across lines of difference. Very little about today\u2019s Congress \u2014 almost nothing except the crucial Senate filibuster \u2014 compels or encourages that kind of cross-partisan bargaining. A more effective Congress would need to be far better suited to this purpose. That calls for concerted decentralization, which means empowering not individual members but groups of members to advance shared priorities and negotiate differences. Advancing shared group priorities would mean building more coherent factions within the two party conferences. Members should pursue their key goals by organizing with like-minded colleagues and thinking in terms of more self-aware party subgroups. As the political scientist Daniel DiSalvo has observed, \u201cFactions may reduce party unity, but paradoxically they may also increase the parties\u2019 ability to govern.\u201d Opening room for negotiated legislation, meanwhile, requires grasping the importance of the committee system in the House. Mr. McCarthy\u2019s Republican critics seemed intent on weakening the speaker by empowering individual members. But isolated members offering proposals and amendments on the floor are more easily overpowered by party leaders, and the House floor is essentially a television studio. Real decentralization would require giving power to the middle layers of Congress\u2019s work \u2014 the committees, which are organized around substantive policy domains and where members could work out differences in smaller groups and more focused ways.\n\nRight now, in a Congress tightly run by party leaders, the work of the committees barely matters. Helping their work to matter more is crucial to improving Congress. All this points to some specific reforms that members contemplating future leadership struggles could have in their back pockets. Consider five examples: First, members could learn that the Rules Committee could be transformed from the speaker\u2019s fief into a place for negotiation among the majority party\u2019s core factions about priorities. Second, they could help the work of the committees matter by giving each of the House\u2019s authorizing committees control over some modest portion of time on the floor, allowing legislation that has made it through the committee \u2014 perhaps with at least one vote from a member of the minority party \u2014 to be considered by the entire House, even if it is not a leadership priority. If members had the sense that their committees matter, they might engage in more substantive legislative work. Third, they could further empower the committees by eliminating the longstanding boundary between authorization (the design of programs) and appropriation (the spending of money on those programs), which are now done by separate committees. This would allow the committees that write policy to also propose the spending required to carry it out and would give members who aren\u2019t now appropriators a reason to take their committee work more seriously. The House worked this way from the late 1870s until 1921, and while that period of decentralized appropriations offers some cautionary lessons, there are strong reasons to embrace that approach again. Fourth, and relatedly, reform-minded members could demand a rethinking of the congressional budget process. Created in the mid-1970s to serve a legislature looking to consolidate the Great Society and confront an aggressive Nixon administration, the budget process is now at the heart of Congress\u2019s dysfunction. Mr. McCarthy\u2019s critics got him to promise to abide by the existing process; their successors should demand a bipartisan effort to rethink how it works altogether. Finally, members could move to transform the dynamics of the House through an important bit of constitutional maintenance: Until 1913, the number of members in the House grew regularly with the decennial census, as the population increased. This was clearly the intention of the Constitution\u2019s framers. If Congress had continued to follow the formula for expansion it used in the 19th century, the House would now have about 150 more members than it does. Expanding it by that number and then letting it grow a little with every census as the population does would improve representation, increase the likelihood of more varied intraparty factions and help spur other needed changes. Reformers should demand a vote on such a move.",

Here\u2019s the latest at the end of Tuesday.\n\n1. Tens of thousands of Californians were told to evacuate as heavy rains flood the state. Relentless downpours continued to batter California, killing at least 17 people statewide and raising fears of flash floods and mudslides. Forecasters are warning residents to prepare for lightning storms, powerful wind gusts and possibly even tornadoes. The California Highway Patrol is strongly advising residents to limit nonessential travel. Coastal towns like Santa Barbara were particularly hard hit, prompting evacuations and road closures. Experts say the cost of the damage done by the storms could top $1 billion.\n\nThe documents, which date to his time as vice president and included materials on foreign countries, were found by his personal lawyers in early November and handed over to the National Archives, the White House said. Officials have neither said how many documents were involved or their level of classification nor explained why they waited two months before announcing the discovery. In other news from the White House, Biden attended a three-way summit in Mexico with the prime minister of Canada and the president of Mexico to discuss economic cooperation, drug trafficking, migration and climate change.\n\n3. Ukrainian troops will travel to the U.S. to train on an advanced missile system. The soldiers will soon head to Fort Sill, Okla., to begin training on the Patriot missile system, a ground-based air defense system, defense officials said. The U.S. said that it was sending the Patriot system to Ukraine as part of a $1.8 billion aid package that was announced last month during President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s visit to Washington. Training on the system can take months. However, one defense official said that Ukrainian troops, who have shown themselves to be quick studies on military systems, might be able to get up to speed more quickly. For the Biden administration, the unusual step of U.S.-based training does not risk escalation with Russia, as Patriot is a defensive system that is meant to protect Ukrainians from Russian missiles, not an offensive one.\n\n4. Protests over the ouster of Peru\u2019s former president have led to at least 46 deaths. At least 17 people were killed yesterday in southern Peru in an extraordinary spasm of violence that led to criticism of excessive force by the military and the police. The country has been the scene of violent demonstrations since mid-December, when its leftist president, Pedro Castillo, who had promised to address longstanding issues of poverty and inequality, attempted to dissolve Congress and rule by decree. The move was widely condemned as unconstitutional, and he was arrested and replaced by his vice president.

The recent clashes heightened concerns that the protests would continue to spread and lead to more bloodshed.

Trillions of dollars in government spending is beginning to alter the labor market. The primary purpose of recent federal legislation \u2014 $1.2 trillion from the 2021 infrastructure bill, $370 billion in the climate bill and $53 billion for semiconductor manufacturing \u2014 was not to stimulate the economy. But as the broader economy cools, the continuing infusion of cash may help avert a sharp dip in employment brought on by the Federal Reserve\u2019s attempts to contain inflation by raising interest rates.

The world remained a hotter planet last year, with extreme summer temperatures in Europe, China and elsewhere contributing to 2022 being the fifth-hottest year on record, European climate researchers said. Even more concerning: The eight warmest years on record have now occurred since 2014, and 2016 remains the hottest year ever. Overall, the world is now 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) hotter than it was in the second half of the 19th century, when emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels became widespread. In the U.S., greenhouse gas emissions rose by 1.3 percent last year, moving the nation in the opposite direction from its climate goals.\n\nAs a traveling wrestler, Donovan Danhausen mainly survived off his paycheck from his day job at Starbucks.

            "content": "Lailing Yu near her home in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park. A longtime registered Democrat, she switched her party affiliation last year and voted for Representative Lee Zeldin, a Republican, for governor.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nWorries about public safety, especially attacks against Asian Americans, caused some in the once-reliably Democratic bloc to vote Republican last year.\n\nAsian Americans have typically formed a crucial and reliable voting bloc for Democrats in recent years, helping the party maintain its political dominance in liberal states like New York. But Republicans shattered that presumption in November when they came within striking distance of winning the governor\u2019s race in New York for the first time in 15 years, buoyed in part by a surge of support among Asian American voters in southern Brooklyn and eastern Queens. Now, Democrats are trying to determine how they can stem \u2014 and, if possible, reverse \u2014 the growing tide of Asian American voters drifting away from the party amid a feeling that their concerns are being overlooked. Interviews with more than 20 voters of Asian descent, many of them Chinese Americans who had historically voted for Democrats but did not in 2022, found that many went with the Republican candidate for governor, Lee Zeldin, even if begrudgingly, largely because of concerns about crime.\n\nOne lifelong Democrat from Queens, Karen Wang, 48, who is Chinese American, said she had never felt as unsafe as she did these days. \u201cBeing Asian, I felt I had a bigger target on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cMy vote,\u201d she added, \u201cwas purely a message to Democrats: Don\u2019t take my vote for granted.\u201d Besides crime, Asian American voters expressed concern over a proposal by former Mayor Bill de Blasio to change the admissions process for the city\u2019s specialized high schools. Democratic leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, have acknowledged their party\u2019s failure to offer an effective message about public safety to counter Republicans\u2019 tough-on-crime platform, which resonated not just with Asian Americans, but with a constellation of voters statewide. In Flushing, Queens, home to one of New York City\u2019s most vibrant Chinatowns, homespun leaflets posted on walls in English and Chinese encouraged passers-by to \u201cVote for Republicans\u201d before the November election, blaming Democrats for illegal immigration and a rise in crime. One flier portrayed Ms. Hochul as anti-police and sought to link her to the death of Christina Yuna Lee, who was fatally stabbed more than 40 times by a homeless man inside her apartment in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown last February.\n\nAlthough Mr. Zeldin lost, his support among Asian American voters helped lift other Republican candidates to surprise victories in down-ballot legislative races. In one of the southern Brooklyn districts with a majority of Asian American voters, Peter J. Abbate Jr., a 36-year Democratic incumbent, lost to Lester Chang, the first Asian American Republican to enter the State Legislature. Mr. Chang\u2019s entrance, however, was clouded by questions about his legal residency, prompting the ruling Assembly Democrats to consider trying to expel him. They ultimately decided not to seek his expulsion, with one lawmaker, Assemblyman Ron Kim, noting that such a move would have provoked a \u201cstrong backlash from the Asian community.\u201d For Democrats, repairing ties with Asian American voters, who account for about 15 percent of New York City\u2019s population and make up the state\u2019s fastest-growing ethnic group, may be a difficult yet critical challenge given the significant role such voters are poised to play in future elections. State Senator John Liu, a Queens Democrat, said that Mr. Zeldin\u2019s campaign message on the crime issue \u201csimply resonated better,\u201d and that Democrats had to improve the way they communicated with Asian Americans, particularly on education policy.\n\n\u201cDemocrats can begin by understanding the Asian American perspective more deeply,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan. \u201cThe broader issue is that many of the social justice issues in this country are still viewed from a Black and white lens, and Asian Americans are simply undetected by that lens and therefore feel completely marginalized.\u201d Republicans performed well in parts of New York City with the largest Asian American populations, drawing voters who said they were concerned primarily with public safety, especially amid a spate of high-profile hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. In Assembly District 49 in Brooklyn, for example, which includes portions of Sunset Park and Dyker Heights, and is majority Asian, Mr. Zeldin won 61 percent of the vote, even though it appears white voters turned out to vote in higher numbers. Mr. Zeldin won by similar margins in a nearby Assembly district that is heavily Chinese and includes Bensonhurst and Gravesend. In Queens, Mr. Zeldin managed to obtain 51 percent of the vote in Assembly District 40, which includes Flushing and is about 70 percent Asian: mostly Chinese and Korean immigrants. Support for Mr. Zeldin, who came within six percentage points of beating Ms. Hochul, was palpable across those neighborhoods before Election Day, with much of the pro-Republican enthusiasm appearing to grow organically. And posts in support of Mr. Zeldin spread broadly across WeChat, a Chinese social media and messaging app widely used by Chinese Americans. Interviews with Asian American voters revealed that their discontent with the Democratic Party was, in many cases, deep-rooted and based on frustrations built over years. Many of them described becoming disillusioned with a party that they said had overlooked their support and veered too far to the left. They listed Democratic priorities related to education, criminal justice and illegal immigration as favoring other minority groups over Asian Americans, and blamed Democratic policies for a rise in certain crimes and for supporting safe injection sites. Voters traced their sense of betrayal in part to a divisive 2018 proposal by Mayor de Blasio, a Democrat, to alter the admissions process for the city\u2019s elite high schools, several of which are dominated by Asian American students, to increase enrollment among Black and Hispanic students.\n\nThe plan would have effectively reduced the number of Asian American students offered spots at the elite schools, which made some Asian Americans feel that Democrats were targeting them. Mayor Eric Adams, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s successor, moved away from his predecessor\u2019s plan to diversify the city\u2019s top schools, but the effort galvanized Asian Americans politically, prompting parents to become more engaged and laying the groundwork for Republicans to make inroads among aggrieved voters. Indeed, one vocal political club that emerged from the education debate, the Asian Wave Alliance, actively campaigned for Mr. Zeldin. \u201cWhy should I support Democrats who discriminate against me?\u201d said Lailing Yu, 59, a mother from Hong Kong whose son graduated from a specialized high school in 2018. \u201cWe see Democrats are working for the interest of African Americans and Latino communities against Asian communities.\u201d After years as a registered Democrat, Ms. Lu switched her party registration to Republican last year and voted for Mr. Zeldin. She ticked off a litany of recent instances of street violence \u2014 including one involving a stranger who spit at her while she was taking out her trash \u2014 that she said made her feel less safe now than when she arrived in the United States 50 years ago. \u201cI think what upset me to see Asian Americans veer right is that they were swayed by fear and fear alone,\u201d said Representative Grace Meng, a Queens Democrat of Taiwanese descent. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we are working with the Asian American community, but also with our leaders up and down the ballot to make sure they\u2019re listening and responsive to our concerns, which is not just substance, but outreach, especially during campaigns.\u201d\n\nMr. Ni said fears over subway crime had disrupted his daily life and further estranged him from the Democratic Party. His wife, he said, recently began to drive the couple\u2019s son to school from southern Brooklyn to Upper Manhattan, forcing her to spend hours in traffic instead of working at the computer store the family owns in Sunset Park. \u201cIf I told my son to go to the subway, we will worry about it,\u201d said Mr. Ni, 45, who was a Democrat since immigrating to the United States from China in 2001 but who switched parties and voted for President Donald J. Trump in 2020. This year, Mr. Ni decided to play an active role in getting other Asian Americans to the polls: He helped organize an effort that raised about $12,000 to print get-out-the-vote banners, fliers and bags in English and Chinese. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t complain,\u201d read the signs, a slogan that also spread on WeChat and other social media platforms. The message did not explicitly urge voters to back Mr. Zeldin, whom Mr. Ni voted for, but the materials were passed out primarily at rallies for Mr. Zeldin in the city\u2019s Chinese neighborhoods.\n\nDemocratic officials said they believed that many Asian Americans that voted Republican tended to be East Asian, particularly Chinese voters who may be more culturally conservative. Republicans may have also found success among first-generation immigrants who may not be as attuned to the history of racial inequity that has led Democrats to enact policies that Republicans have targeted, such as reforms to New York\u2019s bail laws. Mr. Zeldin also made a point of meeting with, and raising money from, Asian American leaders and activists. The approach helped him win \u2014 and, in some cases, run up the vote \u2014 in many districts dominated by Asian American voters and enabled him to chip into Ms. Hochul\u2019s overwhelming support in the rest of the city. Even so, some Asian American leaders noted that Mr. Zeldin\u2019s near singular focus on crime \u2014 his campaign framed the election in existential terms: \u201cVote like your life depends on it, because it does\u201d \u2014 allowed him to run up his numbers across many voting groups, including white and suburban voters, not just Asian Americans.\n\nMany Democratic officials noted Ms. Hochul\u2019s effort to rally Asian American voters in the campaign\u2019s closing weeks, but characterized the push as too little, too late. After the election, the governor acknowledged that Democrats had fallen short in communicating their message about public safety to Asian American voters, saying that \u201cmore could have been done to make sure that people know that this was a high priority of ours.\u201d \u201cObviously, that was not successful in certain communities who were hearing other voices and seeing other messaging and seeing other advertising with a contrary message about our priorities,\u201d Ms. Hochul said in November after signing two bills aimed at curbing hate crimes.",

In the prince\u2019s full-throated renunciation of fame and royalty with all its punishing invasions of privacy, he has only become more famous, if not more regal, trading his proximity to the throne for the No. 1 spot on cushioned chairs opposite Oprah and Anderson Cooper.

Its basic three-act structure of childhood, Army service and wedded bliss is as subdivided as a California lot into shorter episodes and paragraphs, many only one sentence long.

If there\u2019s a murder Harry is trying to solve, it\u2019s of course that of his own mother, Princess Diana, whose death in the Pont de l\u2019Alma tunnel in 1997, under chase by paparazzi, is the defining tragedy of his life, and thus of this book. To her younger son, only 12 at the time, the click of cameras wielded by paps, as he derisively calls them, came to sound \u201clike a gun cocking or a blade being notched open.\u201d (From the looks of \u201cHarry & Meghan,\u201d which has plenty of sanctioned shots of the couple\u2019s courtship and toddlers, he is fighting back by hand with his own iPhone.) Diana defended herself against the constant onslaught of photographers by lobbing water balloons and, more sinisterly, by hiding in the trunks of getaway cars, a trick Harry eventually picked up. \u201cIt felt like being in a coffin,\u201d he writes. \u201cI didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nMired in a \u201cred mist\u201d of grief and anger, the prince self-medicates at first with candy and then, as the hated tabloids report with varying degrees of accuracy, alcohol, weed, cocaine, mushrooms and ayahuasca.

In one of the book\u2019s cringier moments, he writes that Willy, who calls him Harold though his given name is Henry, stamps his foot over choosing the continent as a cause. \u201cAfrica was his thing,\u201d Harry explains, mimicking his brother\u2019s petulant tone. \u201cI let you have veterans, why can\u2019t you let me have African elephants and rhinos?\u201d Cattily he notes Willy\u2019s \u201calarming baldness, more advanced than my own,\u201d while dinging the Princess of Wales for being slow to share her lip gloss. Candidly he shows the then-Prince Charles doing headstands in his boxer shorts and his family\u2019s charade of an annual performance review: the Court Circular. Like its author, \u201cSpare\u201d is all over the map \u2014 emotionally as well as physically. He does not, in other words, keep it tight. Harry is frank and funny when his penis gets frostbitten after a trip to the North Pole \u2014 \u201cmy South Pole was on the fritz\u201d \u2014 leaving him a \u201ceunuch\u201d just before William marries Kate Middleton.

Therapy, in which he claims William refuses to participate, and a whiff of First by Van Cleef & Arpels, help Harry learn to cry, unlocking a stream of repressed recollections of Diana, and that\u2019s when even the most hardened reader might herself weep. Charles\u2019s own scent, Dior\u2019s Eau Sauvage, and his marriage to Camilla, leave him relatively cold. And yet when his father advises of the unrelenting and often racist press coverage of Harry\u2019s union to Meghan \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t read it, darling boy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s difficult not to agree.

            "section": "Food",
            "content": "Grits are a beloved staple in many Southerners\u2019 diets, a quintessential grain rivaled only by rice. But some say that they don\u2019t have any defining taste, or that their texture is clumpy or congealed. Clearly, those detractors have never had stone-ground grits, which have way more flavor and texture than their instant or quick-cooking counterparts.\n\nUnlike more typical quick-cooking varieties, stone-ground grits are cooked slowly on a stovetop, with an occasional stir. There\u2019s something serene about watching them simmer on a weekend morning until they turn gorgeously creamy and start to pop, their popcorn-like aroma filling the air.\n\nAnd they can have so much range. \u201cFor holidays, my granny Freddie Mae would make glorified grits \u2014 a souffl\u00e9,\u201d said Carla Hall, the chef and Nashville native. But on a day-to-day basis, she said, they \u201cwere just another porridge.\u201d\n\nCorn grits aren\u2019t complicated: They\u2019re just milled dent corn. Unlike the sweet corn that is eaten off the cob or in salads like succotash, dent corn has a high soft-starch content, making it ideal for the hot-cereal consistency of grits. But, whether you are serving a humble bowl of white grits for breakfast or making shrimp and grits for dinner or brunch, the quality of both the crop and the milling process will determine how flavorful they are and the resulting texture.",

            "section": "Style",
            "content": "It hardly matters. Particularly at the largest houses, where accessories drive profits and designers are challenged to generate the cross-channel content central to a brand\u2019s identity and desirability. This is especially true at what was once a fusty luggage maker and is now the cornerstone of the world\u2019s largest luxury goods house, where sales last year topped $22 billion, according to estimates by the HSBC banking giant.\n\nWhile it is true that men\u2019s wear accounts for just a portion of profits at Vuitton, its halo effect on the brand\u2019s image, which began when Mr. Abloh was appointed in 2018, cannot be overstated. And there is every reason to believe that Mr. Burke\u2019s motivation in choosing Mr. Dillane as guest runway designer was to advance a brand narrative.\n\nFrom the outset it was clear that as a designer, Mr. Dillane, 31, was a great storyteller. While still a math whiz-kid at Brooklyn Tech, he began making and selling T-shirts in his school cafeteria. He presented one of his earliest collections in 2020 as a stop-motion film featuring modified Barbie dolls wearing miniature versions of his streetwear designs. Financing his own brand with the profits from cartoony KidSuper hoodies and T-shirts, he went on to create other shoestring productions starring his parents, people from his friend cohort, strangers filmed on the streets and invited to share their dream ambitions, and, perhaps most notably, Claymation figures.\n\nIt was the latter that attracted the attention of the judges for the prestigious LVMH Prize, which celebrates designers under 40; in 2021 it awarded him the runner-up Karl Lagerfeld prize with two other designers. As Mr. Abloh did, Mr. Dillane flourishes on creative collaboration. (Among his improbably commercial partners have been Puma, Jagermeister, Modelo and SpaghettiOs.) Yet unlike the relentlessly referential Mr. Abloh, who fulfilled the curator and art critic Nicolas Bourriaud\u2019s long-ago prophecy that, in the future, the D.J. would become the dominant figure in our culture \u2014 Mr. Dillane is less mixmaster than irrepressible generator of ideas.\n\nAsked last year by Mr. Burke to present a few designs for Vuitton, he instead produced a 500-page mission statement. \u201cIt was 5 percent product and 95 percent ideas and concepts,\u201d Mr. Dillane said by phone. As a first-generation American, the child of a Spanish mother and Irish father, he said, \u201cI always felt this pressure to hustle and make the most of every opportunity.\u201d",

            "content": "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 97 percent of home appraisers in the United States are white. Advocates say it is time to recruit more people of color, particularly Black women.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTwo veteran appraisers and a newcomer have different but compatible approaches to combating discrimination against Black homeowners.\n\nThe home appraisal industry is overwhelmingly white, male and aging: the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that of the 75,000 appraisers in the United States, 97 percent are white, and other surveys show that nearly three-quarters are both male and above the age of 45. This lack of representation, Black real estate professionals say, is a glaring problem, contributing to a persistent, widespread practice in the home appraisal industry to give higher values to homes when the occupants are white, and devalue them if the owners are Black. \u201cThe issue of discriminatory appraisals is a major challenge in our community,\u201d said Lydia Pope, president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, an advocacy organization for Black professionals in the industry. The simplest solution, Ms. Pope said, is recruiting more Black appraisers, and particularly Black women. The New York Times spoke to three of them \u2014 two industry veterans and one just completing her training \u2014 about racism, representation, and cautious optimism in the industry. The responses have been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nChief executive and founder of a consultancy addressing bias in appraising Ms. White, 41, has been a certified appraiser for 20 years. She estimates that of 75,000 appraisers in the United States, she\u2019s one of about 300 Black women actively working in the industry. Part of the issue is the appraisal industry\u2019s training structure: In addition to the cost of education, most states also require aspiring appraisers to find a mentor to spend hundreds of hours or more training them. For Black people \u2014 and particularly Black women \u2014 looking to enter the profession, the lack of mentors within their communities is often a dead end. Ms. White said she is driven to serve as an adviser for young women eager to enter the industry. Formerly the head of growth for Aloft, an appraisal start-up, she recently launched her own consultancy to help homeowners understand their rights if they feel their home was appraised unfairly. When I look back on my career, I can definitely say things have gotten better in terms of the opportunities presenting themselves as I become more established. But when I think about my early days, it\u2019s only in hindsight that I see just how many odds were stacked against me in terms of even being able to become an appraiser. My new venture is a combination of consulting, educating and speaking. It\u2019s about putting out content that educates the homeowner on what to do if you get an appraisal back and it is low and you think it is due to bias or any other reason.\n\nIn the event that a Black homeowner has an appraisal that comes in low and they don\u2019t have a family member who is a Black appraiser, the information they have available to them usually comes either from someone who isn\u2019t an actual appraiser, but is trying to offer advice on the appraisal process. Or if that person is an appraiser, they might be concerned about bias, but they aren\u2019t a person of color themselves. Black appraisers in this space are generally still only talking about how to become an appraiser in the first place. There wasn\u2019t anybody in the space who was a Black appraiser speaking to Black homeowners about the specific issues they face. I can step into that space and provide guidance. My mandate to stay in that industry is crystal clear. There are so few of us who can speak to both sides of this conversation, both what it\u2019s like to be Black in America, and also to what it\u2019s like to be an appraiser and have an appraiser\u2019s methodology.\n\nLicensed appraiser and member of the Appraisal Foundation Advisory Council Ms. Marsh, 54, lives in Washington, D.C., and has been an appraiser for 22 years. She was previously president of the Appraisal Institute\u2019s Washington, D.C. chapter. To attract more Black appraisers, she said, the profession needs to be marketed as a family business that can be passed down from generation to generation. What we\u2019re finding is that when we try to introduce the industry to young Black people, they know nothing about it. So we\u2019re trying to catch them while they\u2019re in college. There are a lot of programs developing around the country to bring new appraisers into the industry. But on the flip side, it\u2019s going to be another two, three or even five years before they\u2019re working in the market. And while this happening, Black homeowners continue to lose equity every day. There needs to be mandatory bias training within the appraisal industry. And there has to be a more active role by lenders in banks to develop an appraisal bias review process.\n\nCurrently training to become an appraiser through the New York Mortgage Coalition Appraisal training program In New York State, the New York Mortgage Coalition is covering the cost of appraisal training and materials for dozens of aspiring Black appraisers, the majority of them women. Ms. Oshodi, 36, is one of them. She lives in Harlem and runs diversity and equity training programs for nonprofit organizations. A longtime renter, she became interested in a second career as an appraiser after spending three years trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to buy a home for herself. It\u2019s no wonder that the home appraiser field is not really talked about in our communities. Without this training program, I would never have been able to keep going while working full-time because there are just so many classes you have to complete. All the time, after work, I\u2019m studying. The fact that there are so many white male appraisers is why I want to be an advocate. I understand that for community wellness, diversity plays a huge part. It makes me feel like, OK, I have to do this. As a woman and a person of color, my perspectives will be different. A lot of folks try to avoid racism or discrimination by just not talking about it. And in fact, that just causes it to perpetuate. Being a Black woman, though, I don\u2019t have that option. You have to be anti-racist, or working toward it.",

Anyone can read what you share.\n\nTicket prices won\u2019t exactly be less, but the cost of some activities and perks will be adjusted, after complaints about the cost of visits.\n\nIn an acknowledgment that it may have pushed too hard on its domestic theme parks for profit, angering some of its most loyal customers in the process, Disney revised policies related to ticketing, hotel parking, ride photos and annual passes on Tuesday. Disney, for instance, will no longer charge $15 to $25 per vehicle, per night for guests registered at the 30 hotels and resorts it owns at Walt Disney World in Florida. The company started charging for hotel parking in 2018. At the time, Frommer\u2019s called the move \u201ca surprising money grab.\u201d Disney will also make Disneyland in California cheaper to visit by \u201csignificantly\u201d expanding the number of days when adult tickets sell for $104, the lowest price, according to Josh D\u2019Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. He said the number of $104 days would now represent about two months of the year at Disneyland, which charges $179 for adults on the most desirable dates. \u201cWe want to make sure our fans are feeling the love,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cWe\u2019re listening to them, and we\u2019re trying to adjust.\u201d\n\nDisney is not reducing ticket prices \u2014 at least, not exactly \u2014 in part because demand has remained surprisingly resilient despite a slowing economy and recession fears. Disneyland, for instance, is sold out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week. Disney also maintains that its ticket prices and varied hotel offerings are flexible enough to accommodate budget-minded visitors.

The company is pushing back \u201cNone of these changes are about demand,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. He also said that the \u201cenhancements\u201d announced on Tuesday were not directly tied to a management shake-up at Disney late last year, when Bob Chapek was fired as chief executive and Robert A. Iger came out of retirement to retake the reins. \u201cThis is not necessarily about a change in leadership,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cI have a lot of face-to-face conversations with guests when I\u2019m walking the parks, and I read a lot of their comments online. \u201cIf you move a tree, if you change a procedure, if you start asking for reservations \u2014 that\u2019s a big deal to our guests,\u201d he added. \u201cThey care. They really, really care. And if people care that much, then I have an obligation to listen and, when appropriate, to make some changes and modifications.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, some of Disney\u2019s most dedicated theme park customers have grown indignant over price increases, some of which have been viewed as nickel and diming. At Disney World, for instance, annual passes used to include free photo downloads \u2014 such as digital snapshots taken by surprise during rides and images from character meet-and-greets taken by Disney photographers. In 2021, Disney started charging extra for the downloads.\n\nAnnual pass holders have also complained bitterly about a 2021 decision by Disney to require all domestic park visitors to have a reservation in addition to a ticket or pass. Pass holders were no longer able to drop by anytime they wanted, even if they paid $1,399 for the most expensive Disney World pass. Disney began requiring reservations as a way to control crowds during the pandemic. But the reservation system also reflected a policy shift. To cheers from Wall Street \u2014 and boos from many Disney fans \u2014 Mr. Chapek pushed the company\u2019s theme parks to focus less on maximizing attendance and more on increasing how much money visitors spend. Mr. Chapek called this \u201cyield management,\u201d and it helped Disney recover financially from the pandemic. Increases in theme park profit also helped offset losses in Disney\u2019s streaming division. For the 2022 fiscal year, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products had $28.7 billion in revenue and $7.9 billion in profit. To compare, the unit had $26.2 billion in revenue and $6.8 billion in profit in 2019. The policy changes that Mr. D\u2019Amaro unveiled on Tuesday will go into effect at varying times over the next couple of months. In California, Disney will ease restrictions on guests with higher-priced \u201cpark-hopping\u201d tickets, which gives them the ability to visit both Disneyland and the adjacent California Adventure theme park in a single day. (Park hopping was previously restricted to 1 p.m. or later. The privilege will now begin at 11 a.m.) Disneyland will also provide free downloads of ride photos to all ticketed guests; that offering currently starts at $15. In Florida, Disney will allow annual pass holders to visit theme parks after 2 p.m. without a reservation, except on Saturdays and Sundays at the Magic Kingdom, the busiest Disney World property. In another change, guests who pay for the smartphone-based service called Genie+, which gives them speedier access to rides, will receive attraction photos for no additional charge.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the Genie product, which has been incredibly popular, but we\u2019re going to continue to look at ways to add more value,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Amaro said. In addition, Disney has been offering its usual array of January deals. On Monday, Disney World announced ticket and hotel discounts for Florida residents. Disneyland is offering a deal for Southern California residents that can reduce weekday ticket prices to $73 until June. In a discount available to anyone, Disney World is offering 25 percent off rooms at certain hotels. People who book five-night packages for summer can get up to $750 to spend on food. (Disney World stopped offering its popular Dining Plan promotions in 2020.)",

The couple chose to keep the room\u2019s original curtains.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nGlenn Lawson and Nima Dabestani value alignment in all areas of their life. The couple met in Los Angeles 11 years ago on the day after Thanksgiving. \u201cWe had both seen the Muppets movie that day, which was odd \u2014 but it\u2019s how we each knew the other wasn\u2019t a psychopath,\u201d recalls Lawson, 50, a furniture designer and co-founder, with his business partner Grant Fenning, of the Los Angeles home goods company Lawson-Fenning, which is known for its own line of vintage-inspired handmade pieces and for its collaborations with a roster of other California-based designers. Eight years later, the couple eloped, making \u201cthe very wise decision of doing it over Thanksgiving weekend so it\u2019s a nice, clean, anniversary,\u201d explains Dabestani, 40, an actor and producer. \u201cThat gives you some insight into our relationship,\u201d Lawson notes. And into their design philosophy. Lawson describes himself as a purist whose aesthetic \u201cis rooted in the history of Southern California architecture and design.\u201d So in 2020, when he and Dabestani purchased a second home in the hills of Santa Barbara \u2014 a 90-minute drive from their Spanish-style main residence in Los Feliz \u2014 they wanted the interiors of the property to reflect its vintage. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got this 1975 house, I want it to feel like 1975,\u201d says Lawson of the three-floor, 2,200-square-foot, redwood post-and-beam, which looks out toward the Santa Ynez mountains.\n\nThe house\u2019s previous owners had kept it in excellent condition, so Lawson and Dabestani initially planned to update only the windows and doors, as well as to reface the kitchen. \u201cBut as we spent more time in the place, we kept getting ideas for things we wanted to do, so we decided to just go for it and do a full renovation,\u201d Lawson explains.\n\nThe couple chose their longtime friend Christos Prevezanos of Studio Preveza for the project \u2014 not only because he was already so familiar with their style, but also because they knew he would eventually spend time in the home as a visitor. \u201cHe\u2019s designing it for us knowing we\u2019re going to have him up here,\u201d says Dabestani. \u201cWhat\u2019s the kind of space he wants to be a guest in?\u201d The answer, apparently, is an expansive one with awe-inspiring views and slightly more color than Lawson is used to. \u201cI\u2019m very neutral,\u201d he says. \u201cIf everything could be brown, I\u2019d be so happy. But Christos pushed me and brought in blues, oranges and ochers.\u201d\n\nThe main living area of the home is on the second floor, where the trio chose to do away with a bedroom in order to create a 1,100-square-foot open-plan lounge, dining space and kitchen. \u201cThe \u201970s was the first era in which people were like, \u2018We don\u2019t need a formal living room,\u2019\u201d says Lawson. \u201cIt\u2019s really about living, and not this facade of living \u2014 especially in California, where people were a little more open-minded about what was possible.\u201d Floor-to-ceiling windows offer panoramic vistas animated by paragliders, hawks or rolling clouds, depending on the day. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a painting, or a giant TV,\u201d says Prevezanos. \u201cBeing able to clear my head and have this palette to focus on is the dream,\u201d says Lawson, who designed the room\u2019s cozy L-shaped white wool boucl\u00e9 sectional, which Dabestani compares to a teddy bear. Arranged in front of it is a vintage \u201970s Dutch tile-top coffee table, and to its left is a cubic lava rock side table from the contemporary Mexican brand Ayres. \u201cWe\u2019re big fans of surfaces that aren\u2019t precious, so you can just put a drink anywhere,\u201d says Lawson.\n\nThat idea extends to the kitchen area, where Prevezanos suggested a thin Caesarstone countertop that would be durable enough to withstand hot pans and sharp knives. The push cabinets as well as the paneling in the adjoining dining space are oak, the latter brightened up with a chromogenic photograph of desert hills in Death Valley by the Sante Fe, N.M.-based artist David Benjamin Sherry and a figurative painting by the Southern California artist J. Carino. The oak was sourced from Lawson\u2019s native Wisconsin, and the wood dining table \u2014 a Danish piece from the 1970s \u2014 was purchased at auction in Copenhagen. Dabestani is especially fond of the upholstered window seat behind the head of the table, which is covered with speckled taupe fabric from the American design company BBDW and is the perfect spot for postprandial lounging. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have our families here, all sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to end dinner, but you can still be more comfortable.\u201d\n\nUpstairs, the couple transformed what was once the living room into a primary bedroom that opens \u2014 through a wall of built-in, hunter green closets \u2014 to a private patio with an outdoor shower. Under the room\u2019s oversize globe-shaped Isamu Noguchi Akari pendant lamp sits a wooden Lawson-Fenning Chilsehurst bed with an upholstered headboard in soft gray Rosemary Hallgarten fabric and a pair of Ceramicah lamps. The couple pushed out an exterior wall, which had formed part of an adjacent foyer, to create a 72-square-foot light-filled bathroom lined with unglazed, sand-hued Cl\u00e9 tiles and lit by an Allied Maker wall fixture. On the landing just outside their room is a BBDW desk \u2014 where Dabestani likes to work \u2014 and a 1970s wooden Mexican hand-shaped chair. Lawson prefers to spread out and draw at the dining table.\n\nThe lowest level of the house is reserved for overnight visitors, of which the pair have had a steady stream since refurbishing the house. \u201cWe love the separation of spaces, so that the guests have their own floor,\u201d says Lawson. The two bright bedrooms, explains Provenzano, were inspired by the 1970s and \u201980s New Jersey homes in which he spent time during his childhood. \u201cI wanted it to feel almost like a kid watching \u2018E.T.,\u2019\u201d he says of the decision to install cobalt blue wool carpet, stained oak paneling and retro plaid curtains in both rooms. The movies \u201cPoltergeist\u201d (1982) and \u201cBig\u201d (1988), and the children\u2019s TV show \u201cThe Smurfs,\u201d which first aired in 1981, were also among his visual references. In one of the rooms, a corkboard hangs on a closet door. \u201cWhen people come up to stay, they can pin something up,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cSo we\u2019re inviting all of our painter friends, and then we\u2019ll sell it to MoMA,\u201d Dabestani adds, with a laugh. The wall-to-wall carpet is, perhaps, the ultimate display of the couple\u2019s commitment to \u201970s style. \u201cIt was so foreign to us; we\u2019d never done carpeting in anything before,\u201d Lawson says. Happily, they love the added depth and comfort it provides, as well as the sense that they\u2019ve returned the home to its roots. Says Dabestani: \u201cIt felt like we were doing right by the house.\u201d",

            "content": "Ataques en Brasilia, Laredo y la globalizaci\u00f3n, un desaf\u00edo para ser feliz y m\u00e1s para estar al d\u00eda.\n\nEl fin de semana, decenas de sus seguidores irrumpieron en los recintos de los tres poderes de la naci\u00f3n, en protesta por lo que, alegan, fueron unas elecciones ama\u00f1adas. No existen pruebas de que los comicios de 2022, en las que Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva result\u00f3 ganador, hayan sido fraudulentos, a pesar de que Bolsonaro impuls\u00f3 esa falsedad. Para el lunes, m\u00e1s de 200 personas hab\u00edan sido arrestadas en conexi\u00f3n con los disturbios y al menos 1200 hab\u00edan sido detenidas en relaci\u00f3n con los hechos, seg\u00fan las autoridades.\n\nEnero suele ser momento de receso de gran parte del sector p\u00fablico en el pa\u00eds, que vive un aletargamiento generalizado hasta la temporada de carnavales. Y, como era fin de semana, muchos de los edificios invadidos en Brasilia estaban vac\u00edos. Lula tampoco estaba en la capital en ese momento. No obstante, el Congreso entr\u00f3 en sesi\u00f3n de emergencia, el gobernador del Distrito Federal de Brasil, que incluye Brasilia, fue suspendido de su cargo y los l\u00edderes del Congreso, el Ejecutivo y el poder Judicial calificaron los hechos del domingo de \u201cterrorismo\u201d y llamaron a una investigaci\u00f3n. A nivel nacional, ahora se espera que las indagaciones determinen si hubo coordinaci\u00f3n para realizar los ataques a la sede del poder brasile\u00f1o y qui\u00e9nes ser\u00edan los responsables.\n\n\u201cLula tiene mucho trabajo por delante para mantener unida a su naci\u00f3n\u201d, coment\u00f3 Vanessa Barbara en las p\u00e1ginas de Opini\u00f3n. \u201cUn buen punto de partida ser\u00e1 mantener la calma tras estos deplorables sucesos y seguir con firmeza los ritos de la justicia para que los culpables rindan cuentas\u201d.

UU. y M\u00e9xico se han pronunciado condenando \u201clos ataques a la democracia de Brasil y a la transferencia pac\u00edfica del poder\u201d. El papa Francisco dijo \u201cpienso en las numerosas crisis pol\u00edticas en diversos pa\u00edses del continente americano, con su carga de tensiones y formas de violencia que agudizan los conflictos sociales\u201d. Y en todo el mundo, analistas y p\u00fablico en general formulan paralelos entre lo ocurrido el fin de semana y los acontecimientos del 6 de enero en el Capitolio de EE. UU. Como escribi\u00f3 ayer Jack Nicas, nuestro corresponsal en Brasil: Independientemente de los fallos de seguridad que hayan ocurrido, los disturbios del domingo dejaron al desnudo de forma sorprendente el principal desaf\u00edo que enfrenta la democracia de Brasil. A diferencia de otros intentos por derrocar gobiernos en la historia de Am\u00e9rica Latina, los ataques del domingo no fueron ordenados por un solo gobernante autoritario o un ej\u00e9rcito decidido a tomar el poder, sino que m\u00e1s bien fueron impulsados por una amenaza m\u00e1s insidiosa y arraigada: un enga\u00f1o masivo.

It plans to notify the bulk of the affected employees on Wednesday, the people said.\n\nThe layoffs across the bank underscore the economic challenges facing the Wall Street giant, which is also trying to regain its footing after a costly push into consumer banking.\n\nGoldman, like other major investment banks, had seen its fees soar during the pandemic, bolstered by a huge upswing in deal-making, trading and related activities. But it has struggled to keep up the momentum as deals have slowed and markets have fallen. Investors have also sharply questioned the growth prospects of the consumer-lending business that the bank rolled out in 2016.",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "The most talked about part of the deal Kevin McCarthy made with Republican radicals to become speaker of the House involved concessions to those members on rules, powerful committee assignments for members of the House Freedom Caucus and the creation of a new select committee on the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government that would give Republicans like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio an official platform from which they could undermine the investigations into former President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nAnd although there has been plenty of chatter about the effect this may have on the basic functioning of government, less remarked on but still significant is McCarthy\u2019s pledge to force major budget cuts using the debt ceiling as leverage with the Biden administration. McCarthy has also agreed to pursue a resolution committing the federal government to a balanced budget within the decade, which could not be done without major cuts to Social Security, Medicare and a lot of what\u2019s left of the American welfare state.\n\nNone of this comes as a shock or a surprise. Conservative opposition to social insurance goes back to the New Deal itself, with figures like the previous president Herbert Hoover denouncing Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s policies as \u201csocialism\u201d that would place the nation on a \u201cmarch to Moscow.\u201d And of course, successive Republican Congresses have, since the 2010 Tea Party wave, tried to pass or force gigantic cuts to federal social spending, with the debt ceiling as their preferred hostage.\n\nThis juxtaposition of extreme opposition to social insurance with contempt for constitutional democracy and the rule of law helps illuminate the tight connection between these two strands of contemporary Republican thought. Many of the Republican radicals who seized control of the House last week also voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and they have been vocal apologists for the Jan. 6 insurrectionists.",

It was the violent culmination of incessant rhetorical attacks on the nation\u2019s electoral systems by Mr. Bolsonaro, who lost a close runoff to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in October. It took more than five hours for the authorities to clear protesters from the seat of government, and hundreds have been arrested. Governments in Latin America and beyond were swift to condemn the unrest in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil\u2019s capital, and to express support for Mr. Lula. President Biden, who was visiting the southern U.S. border, called the protests \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn more about the storming of Brazil\u2019s capital buildings, what happened and why.

            "content": "Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, will lead the Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nRepublicans pushed through a measure to create a powerful new committee to scrutinize what they have charged is an effort by the government to target and silence conservatives.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A divided House voted on Tuesday to launch a wide-ranging investigation into federal law enforcement and national security agencies, as Republicans promised to use their new power in Congress to scrutinize what they said was a concerted effort by the government to silence and punish conservatives at all levels, from protesters at school board meetings to former President Donald J. Trump. On a party-line vote of 221 to 211 with all Democrats opposed, the House approved the formation of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which is to be chaired by Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, the incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a staunch ally of Mr. Trump. Mr. Jordan, who was deeply involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, has for months been investigating what he says is a bias in federal law enforcement against conservatives. Now that Republicans have the majority, he plans to use his gavel and his subpoena power to escalate and expand that inquiry, including searching for evidence that federal workers have become politicized and demanding documents about ongoing criminal investigations. In a floor speech, Mr. Jordan said that his goal was not to target Democrats or law enforcement officers who have scrutinized Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. He said his interest was merely in \u201cprotecting the First Amendment\u201d at a time when he said the right was being unfairly targeted.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go after anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want it to stop.\u201d Still, the panel has such broad reach that it appeared positioned to become a main instrument for Republicans to go after the Biden administration, potentially prompting showdowns over access to highly classified information and the details of criminal inquiries. The subcommittee will have open-ended jurisdiction to scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties or to examine how any agency of the federal government has collected, analyzed and used information about Americans. It also has authority to obtain some of the most sensitive secrets in the government, including information about covert actions that is usually the exclusive territory of the congressional intelligence committees. While Republicans have traditionally styled themselves as the party of law and order, in recent years they have contended that law enforcement has treated Mr. Trump unfairly, citing the F.B.I. search of his Mar-a-Lago property for classified White House documents he did not return for more than a year after leaving office, as required by law. They have added other complaints to their ledger to investigate, including allegations that the federal government encouraged Twitter to discriminate against Republicans and the treatment of conservative or right-wing protesters at school board meetings and abortion clinics. The 118th Congress is underway, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats holding the Senate.\n\u2022 None A Wide-Ranging Inquiry: The House approved the The House approved the creation of a committee to scrutinize what Republicans say is the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against conservatives.

They say they have modeled the new subcommittee after the well-respected Church Committee, referring to a 1970s investigation by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, that uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses, including the surveilling of civil rights groups. But Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the panel was more akin to the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee, which demonized Americans suspected of being sympathetic to communism.\n\n\u201cI call it the McCarthy committee, and I\u2019m not talking about Kevin; I\u2019m talking about Joe,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, adding: \u201cThis committee is nothing more than a deranged ploy by the MAGA extremists who have hijacked the Republican Party and now want to use taxpayer money to push their far-right conspiracy nonsense.\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, echoed that sentiment, arguing the goal of the panel was to \u201cenable the House Republicans to interfere with the free operation of businesses they do not like, to inhibit the fight against domestic terrorism and to settle political scores on behalf of Donald Trump.\u201d How Times reporters cover politics.

The Justice Department has traditionally resisted making information about open criminal investigations available to Congress, suggesting that legal and political fights over subpoenas and executive privilege are most likely looming. It remains to be seen who else will serve on the panel. Speaker Kevin McCarthy made numerous concessions to a far-right faction of his party to win the speakership, and the full extent of his promises is not known. Both Mr. Jordan and Mr. McCarthy have spoken for months about their desire for such an investigation and pledged to voters during the 2022 campaign to carry one out.\n\n\u201cIt is undeniable that in recent years, the executive branch of the federal government has abused its authority and violated the civil liberties of American citizens often for political purposes,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, in endorsing the legislation on the floor. Late last year, Mr. Jordan, then the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, oversaw a 1,000-page staff report \u2014 which was mostly a collection of letters mailed by his committee \u2014 that claimed that the F.B.I. had \u201cspied on President Trump\u2019s campaign and ridiculed conservative Americans\u201d and that the \u201crot within the F.B.I. festers in and proceeds from Washington.\u201d\n\nThe resolution appears to enable Mr. Jordan to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for information about the special counsel inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, along with other politically charged matters like an open tax investigation into President Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. While Mr. Jordan\u2019s inquiry will be housed within the Judiciary Committee, its 13 members \u2014 eight of whom would be Republicans \u2014 will not be limited to lawmakers on that panel. That could result in lawmakers trying to scrutinize a Justice Department investigation while the department examines some of those same lawmakers\u2019 conduct concerning the events of Jan. 6. As the House debated the select committee\u2019s creation on Tuesday, Democrats repeatedly emphasized that both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Jordan had refused to comply with subpoenas from the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, an inquiry that they both sought to block. Mr. Jordan strategized with Mr. Trump about an effort to disrupt the certification of the results of the 2020 election on the floor of the House. \u201cThe primary purpose of this special subcommittee is to interfere with the special counsel\u2019s ongoing investigation into a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election,\u201d said Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York, who was a top aide to Democrats who led the first impeachment of Mr. Trump in 2019. \u201cThis is a shocking abuse of power. But it\u2019s not just the usual efforts by members on the other side of the aisle to once again do Donald Trump\u2019s dirty work; this time they\u2019re trying to protect themselves.\u201d Republicans have made little secret of the fact that they plan to shower the Biden administration with investigations, some of them overtly political in nature. But they won bipartisan support on Tuesday for the formation of a separate select committee focused on the strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese government. On a vote of 365 to 65, the House formed a special committee to investigate the Chinese government\u2019s \u201ceconomic, technological and security progress, and its competition with the United States.\u201d The panel is set to be led by Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, a Marine veteran known as a sober-minded national security hawk. Its mission is to examine a slew of topics, including the economic dependence of the United States on Chinese supply chains, the nation\u2019s security assistance to Taiwan, and lobbying efforts by the Chinese government to influence local and state government, as well as academic institutions.",

            "content": "The world remained firmly in warming\u2019s grip last year, with extreme summer temperatures in Europe, China and elsewhere contributing to 2022 being the fifth-hottest year on record, European climate researchers said this week.\n\nThe eight warmest years on record have now occurred since 2014, the scientists, from the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service, reported, and 2016 remains the hottest year ever.\n\nNASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also issued analyses of global temperatures for 2022 on Thursday, and their findings were similar. NASA\u2019s analysis ranked 2022 as tied with 2015 for fifth warmest, while NOAA had last year as the sixth warmest.\n\n\u201cBut ranks only tell you part of the story,\u201d said Russell Vose, a NOAA scientist. What\u2019s more important, he said, is that the past eight years are the warmest ever. \u201cThey really do stand apart,\u201d he said.\n\nEach of the past four decades has been warmer than one that preceded it, Dr. Vose added.\n\nOverall, the world is now 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.1 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than it was in the second half of the 19th century, when emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels became widespread.\n\nCarlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus service, said the underlying warming trend since the pre-industrial age made 2022\u2019s ranking in the top five \u201cneither unexpected or unsurprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rare event now would be to see a really cold year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing the long-term warming trend of the planet,\u201d said Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at Berkeley Earth, an independent organization that analyzes environmental data. \u201cIf you draw a straight line through temperatures since 1970, 2022 lands almost exactly on where you\u2019d expect temperatures to be.\u201d\n\nBerkeley Earth also issued its own analysis this week, ranking 2022 as fifth warmest.\n\nLast year was among the warmest despite the persistence of La Ni\u00f1a for the third consecutive year. La Ni\u00f1a is a climate pattern marked by colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that tend to suppress global temperatures.\n\nThe Copernicus scientists said Europe had its hottest summer ever in 2022, with several heat waves rolling across the continent that set temperature records in many cities. Separate research has shown that heat waves in Europe are increasing in frequency and intensity at a faster rate than almost anywhere else, fueled by warming but also, most likely, by shifts in atmospheric and oceanic circulation.\n\nThe effects of such a warm year were felt elsewhere around the world as well. Eastern and Central China, Pakistan and India all experienced lengthy and extreme heat waves in 2022, and monsoon floods in Pakistan ravaged much of the country. The heat and accompanying dryness also contributed to extensive wildfires in the Western United States.",

The conceit has trickled down to us, now a portent of climatic doom. The floodwaters loom, largely because of our own indifference and negligence. As heat records shatter, as polar icecaps melt, as oceans swell and creep inland, we face the danger of a mass-extinction event, the sixth in the planet\u2019s history. This time, we\u2019re going to need a bigger ark.\n\nStephen Markley\u2019s bracing, beguiling, uneven new novel, \u201cThe Deluge,\u201d tracks a cadre of radicalized scientists and activists from the gathering storm of the Obama years to the super-typhoons of the 2040s. The dystopia is realistic and nuanced, grim but playful, setting Markley\u2019s book apart from the tsunami of recent climate-change literature. In discrete chapters he introduces us to the core of his Cecil B. DeMille cast: Tony Pietrus, a maverick, visionary researcher; the charismatic Kate Morris, equal parts riot grrrl and skilled political operative; Matt, her quiet, conflicted partner; Shane, a single mother who foments eco-terrorism; Keeper, a recovering OxyContin addict whose sections Markley narrates in second person; a former marketing wunderkind, Jackie; the Pastor, a Hollywood actor turned religious zealot; and Ashir al-Hasan, or Ash, a gay, neurodivergent mathematician. Markley rounds out his leads with an array of supporting players, all veering toward a potential cataclysm: a six-degree spike in mean global temperatures.\n\nThey\u2019re ready to rumble, this crew. Their roads meander across the novel\u2019s dusty, scorched landscape but eventually converge in the late 2020s, when a Black Republican woman takes the oath of office as president, vowing restrictions on carbon emissions. Markley\u2019s world-building is superb, his language tactile. Dr. Pietrus pictures undersea methane \u201cbelching up from cracks in the rock, little farts in the dark, that sent schools of pebble-sized bubbles ascending. Or gurgling from invisible pores in the sediment of the ocean floor, beading up, clinging momentarily, and then writhing free of a soft sand carpet \u2026 they climbed through frigid water. A mad poetry scrawled in the unseen corners of the oceans\u2019 expanse.\u201d Social upheavals, too, erupt throughout the novel, from economic crises to martial law.\n\n\u201cThe Deluge\u201d is long on ambition. It\u2019s also long, weighing in at nearly 900 pages \u2014 baggy, restless, immersive. Centrifugal forces threaten to tear it apart, but Markley soldiers on, in hyper-real mode. A kind of metanovel floats just above the surface of \u201cThe Deluge,\u201d satire that reads like a darker, dissonant riff on Joe Klein\u2019s \u201cPrimary Colors,\u201d unfolding in collages of tabloid headlines, Vanity Fair profiles and opinion pieces by the likes of Al Gore, interspersed among the chapters. The author\u2019s just as fascinated with the sausage-making of legislation as with greenhouse gases. Kate and her grass-roots organization, A Fierce Blue Fire, emerge as rainmakers in congressional races; both sides of the aisle court them. Markley lets the zingers fly \u2014 Kate admits to her colleagues that \u201ceven I\u2019m sick of Greta! I\u2019m sick of A.O.C.!\u201d \u2014 but the caricature wears thin and the jokes don\u2019t always land.",

            "section": "Business",
            "content": "As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nAbbie Harrison, a macrobotanical specialist and project archaeologist at Alpine Archaeological Consultants, examining plant materials at a lab in Colorado.Credit...Kristin Braga Wright for The New York Times\n\nTrillions of dollars in government spending will profoundly affect the labor market, but in ways hard to measure, and mostly under the surface.\n\nIt has never exactly been boom times for the archaeology profession, but this past year comes close \u2014 thanks to Congress. Kim Redman runs Alpine Archaeological Consultants, a firm that searches for historically or culturally valuable artifacts in the path of construction \u2014 an essential step for federally assisted projects. For decades, she has hired temporary workers (affectionately known as \u201cshovel bums\u201d) to comb the ground. These days, she\u2019s bringing on as many full-timers as she can, as billions of dollars in infrastructure appropriations make their way down through the states. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to build a road, we\u2019re at the beginning of the process,\u201d Ms. Redman said. \u201cThe opportunities in archaeology are immense right now \u2014 everybody\u2019s trying to hire so we can meet the demand.\u201d\n\nThe primary purpose of the three laws isn\u2019t to stimulate the economy; they are mainly intended to combat climate change, rebuild infrastructure and reduce dependence on foreign semiconductors. But they will affect the labor market, including a reallocation of workers across sectors. The funding comes as the economy is decelerating, and it may avert a sharper dip in employment brought on by the Federal Reserve\u2019s attempts to contain inflation by raising interest rates. The construction industry, in particular, has been buffeted by a slowdown in new-home sales and stagnant demand for new offices. \u201cBy spring or summer, the job market will basically go flat,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe infrastructure spending won\u2019t kick in until late 2023, going into 2024. It feels like the handoff here could be reasonably graceful.\u201d\n\nThe actual number, of course, is larger. Dr. Zandi\u2019s analysis of the infrastructure law found that it would add nearly 360,000 jobs by the end of this year, and 660,000 jobs at its peak employment impact at the end of 2025. He does not expect the Inflation Reduction Act to affect employment significantly, given its lower public expenditure. A group at the University of Massachusetts Amherst disagreed, forecasting the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s impact at 900,000 additional people employed on average each year for a decade. Betony Jones, director of energy jobs at the Department of Energy, thinks the number could be even higher because the bill includes incentives for domestic sourcing of materials that may create more jobs along the supply chain than traditional economic models account for. \u201cIt will change those assumptions in significant ways,\u201d Ms. Jones said. But a number of mitigating forces make that number less powerful than it appears. Some of the jobs already exist, for example, since much of the money will go to extend tax credits that would have expired. The estimate includes jobs that are supported by infrastructure workers\u2019 wages, from hairdressers to plumbers.\n\nIt\u2019s also a gross number, not accounting for the employment that the Inflation Reduction Act could subtract through the taxes it imposes on corporations, or the fossil fuel jobs that might disappear as renewable energy capacity increases. And plenty of the new infrastructure jobs will be filled by people who might otherwise be working in other sectors, especially if they\u2019re better paid. At the same time, inflation has made construction materials more expensive, decreasing the purchasing power of public agencies. For the first portion of money from the infrastructure law, which was allocated to states by a formula in the first half of 2022, that largely meant salvaging large projects already underway that might otherwise have been stymied by rising costs. For all of those reasons, said Alec Phillips, chief political economist for Goldman Sachs, the infusions of cash haven\u2019t increased his payroll employment projections for the coming year.\n\n\u201cThis is not happening in a vacuum,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cOnce you go through all those factors, it\u2019s one of those things that wouldn\u2019t influence our employment forecast all that much.\u201d Nonetheless, the industry-level impact will be significant. The nation will need more people working in construction and manufacturing in the next few years \u2014 even if they come from other professions or, ideally, the ranks of people who aren\u2019t working. That has given organized labor a rare opportunity to expand. In a policy reversal, the infrastructure law allows federally funded transportation projects to require hiring from the local community, which can aid union organizing. The Biden administration also issued an executive order in early 2022 favoring collective bargaining agreements with unions.\n\nThe infrastructure law includes $42.5 billion for expanding broadband access \u2014 part of about $100 billion provided across several measures \u2014 and the agency running the program expects work on the cables and cellphone towers to start in 2024. The Government Accountability Office estimated that 23,000 more people would be needed when deployment peaked. The Communications Workers of America, a union that represents about 130,000 telecommunications workers, said that members had often left for other occupations as industry conditions deteriorated and that many would come back for the right salary and benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people sitting on the sidelines,\u201d said Nell Geiser, the union\u2019s research director. \u201cThey are not willing to take what\u2019s on offer.\u201d It\u2019s clear, however, that new workers will be needed to meet the demand.\n\nThat\u2019s why unions are gearing up training programs and recruiting apprentices, or even \u201cpreapprentices,\u201d some directly out of high school or prison \u2014 times when people sometimes struggle to find work. Mike Hellstrom, Eastern regional manager of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, said the union\u2019s apprenticeship applications had been snapped up within minutes of release. His region \u2014 New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Puerto Rico \u2014 stands to get $45 billion just from the infrastructure law. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really unique time of our lives of being construction workers and watching this building boom we\u2019re about to come into,\u201d Mr. Hellstrom said. Recognizing the need for new workers, the infrastructure law in particular allows state agencies enormous flexibility in using funds for work force development. So far, they\u2019ve been slow to take advantage of it. One reason: You can train people, but if you\u2019re not able to compensate them competitively because of limits set by the state legislature, they\u2019ll go somewhere else.\n\nThat may not be a problem for huge undertakings, like a $935 million award to rebuild two locks on the upper Ohio River, a project that the Army Corps of Engineers expects to directly support 8,900 jobs. But it can prove more difficult for smaller jurisdictions that may lack the staff to solicit bids. Emily Feenstra, chief policy and external affairs officer for the American Society of Civil Engineers, said more coordination would be needed to ensure that all the money that Congress allocated was spent. \u201cOn that smaller scale, it\u2019s almost like matchmaking \u2014 finding the firm, finding the agency and seeing where the needs are,\u201d she said. All of that is good news for people doing the work, like Roger Oberdier, 33, who was hired at Alpine Archaeological Consultants in October. He was happy to find a staff position after picking up jobs all over the country and is applying to Ph.D. programs to advance his career, in which he plans to specialize in zooarchaeology (which means a lot of digging up butchered animals).\n\nAnd the increasing demand for talent affects the whole field. Even friends who don\u2019t want permanent jobs are doing pretty well, hopscotching the country looking for evidence of ancient human activity, Mr. Oberdier said. Job websites like archaeologyfieldwork.com are stacked with listings at pay rates significantly higher than they were in previous years. \u201cRight now, the job market is in favor of the job seeker,\u201d Mr. Oberdier said. \u201cMy friends who are committed shovel bums \u2014 who never want to sit in an office and write a report, they just want to travel the world and hike to new places and be the first person to see something in 10,000 years \u2014 they are taking the jobs they want right now.\u201d",

            "section": "Opinion",
            "content": "Some time ago, I fell into conversation with a colleague about what we had been reading lately, and the person suggested that I absolutely must give Henry James\u2019s \u201cThe Ambassadors\u201d a try. The pandemic intervened, and I forgot the recommendation. But I remembered recently and picked up the novel. Frankly, despite my profound respect for the book, it was a bit of a slog. James\u2019s writing, especially in his last few novels, is not exactly for the beach. His tapeworm sentences qualify as literary Cubism at best or obsessive obfuscation at worst. Even James once recommended reading only five pages of \u201cThe Ambassadors\u201d at a time. But I was struck repeatedly by the fact that, sentence structure aside, so much of the challenge posed by James\u2019s prose is that words often had different meanings around the turn of the century than they do now. This quiet evolution of language is a facet that can be damnably hard to notice day to day, yet its importance is hard to overstate. The central point is this: The fit between words and meanings is much fuzzier and more unstable than we are led to suppose by the static majesty of the dictionary and its tidy definitions. What a word means today is a Polaroid snapshot of its lexical life, long-lived and frequently under transformation.\n\nThe reason begins with the nature of concepts rather than the words that express them. Concepts shade into one another the way colors do. For example, to be foolish is a form of being weak; one kind of weakness is to be distracted by idle fastidiousness rather than focusing on substance; but fastidiousness is also a way of being careful or observant, of which one form is being socially agreeable \u2014 as in \u201cnice.\u201d I raise these examples because the word \u201cnice\u201d actually did describe each of those concepts over the course of several centuries, like a torch passed on from hand to hand in sequence. In 1250, people were called nice when they were dimwitted. Only linguists have any reason to know the circuitous path that took us from that definition to \u201ckind.\u201d Crucially, this is not some isolated instance, but a typical one. It is why \u201csilly\u201d once meant \u201cblessed,\u201d \u201cobnoxious\u201d once meant \u201csubject to harm,\u201d \u201cgenerous\u201d once meant \u201cof noble status,\u201d and today we speak of \u201cheading\u201d out from a party and \u201cheading\u201d up the coast without for a minute thinking it has anything to do with our noggins. Such evolutions are part of why \u201cThe Ambassadors\u201d is best when sipped rather than quaffed and why older texts in general can often be hard to grasp closely. We\u2019re accustomed to focusing on such changes in word meaning in, say, Chaucer or Shakespeare. But James is useful in demonstrating that a text doesn\u2019t need to be nearly so old; much lexical evolution can happen in just over a century. For instance, in \u201cThe Ambassadors,\u201d characters use the word \u201cwonderful\u201d so often that one half expects a song with that title to break out. But James didn\u2019t solely intend the word in the sense we know it today. When Miss Gostrey is taken aback by something the protagonist Lambert Strether says, James writes, \u201cShe had a wonderful look at him now.\u201d But the look she gives him is clearly not the contemporary meaning, which is more or less a synonym for \u201cmarvelous.\u201d James most likely meant that she was giving Strether a look of astonishment \u2014 i.e., full of wonder. The word\u2019s meaning has ooched along since James\u2019s time \u2014 like \u201cnice\u201d \u2014 through a series of conceptual jumps. That which evokes wonder is, after all, likely something you think of as markedly pleasing, and thus to us today, \u201cwonderful\u201d evokes the pleasure more than the surprise. Such eternally floating semantic reinventions are the essence of how language works. Thus when Strether assesses himself as \u201cI\u2019m true, but I\u2019m incredible,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t make sense if \u201cincredible\u201d meant \u201cawesome.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m honest but I\u2019m awesome\u201d? James was above such lexical hash.) To James, \u201cincredible\u201d likely meant \u201cunable to be believed,\u201d based on the literal meaning of the components of the word. So Strether is saying that while he intends sincerity, he doesn\u2019t trust his own instincts, and thus he is perhaps not to be believed.\n\nTo think of language as a list of words with set meanings is like thinking of the position of the clouds right now as somehow fundamental rather than as a passing moment. Attempts to ban all utterances of the N-word, for example, are entirely understandable, be they led by people within the Black community or established as guidelines by schools or companies seeking to temper the use of hateful language. However, total bans neglect that the word has sprouted off, amoeba-style, a newer meaning as a term of affection among Black people. And contrary to popular belief, this is not a recent phenomenon. Evidence suggests that Black Americans have been using the word in this way since at least the mid-19th century, given its rich presence in interviews with often quite elderly ex-slaves by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. The idea that the original meaning of the word is always in essence the only one \u2014 that the amoeba just sat tight for some reason, or that the true meaning of \u201cobnoxious\u201d must always be \u201csubject to harm\u201d \u2014 is rooted in a sense of language as it looks on a page rather than as it lives in the real world. That artificial perspective also encourages the popular but scientifically fragile idea that the words and grammar of your language contribute meaningfully to your particular worldview. This is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or \u201clinguistic relativism.\u201d You may have heard the idea, for example, that the Chinese process time as proceeding vertically because the words for \u201clast\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d in Mandarin also mean \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow.\u201d Or you may have heard that the way Spanish verbs work means that those who speak it are more attuned to the nature of responsibility and blame than English speakers. But while it is true that your language does influence the way you think in quiet, subtle ways, the idea that it creates an entire worldview is possible only if one neglects that words\u2019 meanings are hopelessly motile. The specific rub in these language-is-thought cases is that words can fossilize into inert chunks of grammar, zombie words that retain their original shape but are no longer alive, functioning instead merely as linguistic furniture. In that state, they no longer mean anything that could shape a worldview. Languages quite unlike English help illustrate this. Where cattle and counting are concerned, in English we talk of \u201cheads,\u201d as in \u201cthree head of cattle.\u201d But many languages use dozens of nouns in this numerative fashion with all kinds of objects. Thai for \u201cthree eels\u201d is three \u201cbodies\u201d of eel; Mandarin describes three \u201cstrips\u201d of eel. It\u2019s as if in English we couldn\u2019t say \u201cthree apples\u201d or \u201cthree beds\u201d but had to say \u201cthree globes of apple\u201d or \u201cthree flats of bed.\u201d But in any given language, which of these words you use with which noun can be entirely arbitrary. In Thai, both tables and eels are described as \u201cbodies,\u201d while in Mandarin, eels are \u201cstrips,\u201d but tables are roughly marked as \u201cflats\u201d (as in, they are flat). Now, according to the idea that your language shapes your view of the world, we might expect that in an experiment, Thai speakers would be more likely than Mandarin speakers to perceive tables and eels as having qualities in common. But in fact, they aren\u2019t. Mandarin and Thai speakers just know which counting word goes with which object in their respective languages and that, to an extent, you just have to know. It\u2019s akin to the meaningless gender markings in most European languages that make \u201criver\u201d masculine in Spanish but \u201chand\u201d feminine. In such cases we are in \u201cgrammar\u201d territory rather than \u201cword\u201d territory, something linguists call \u201cgrammaticalization.\u201d The nouns that help represent numbers, for instance, are no longer the living ones in the dictionary that they began as. They have gone dead and become mere rules. They still sound like their original versions, but when used with numbers in expressions such as \u201cthree bodies of eel,\u201d they are just fence posts. They were once living wood, part of a tree reaching for the sky, but they became grammatical lumber, merely corralling the words they modify from one another. Or take another example of lexical evolution in English: \u201cyou guys,\u201d as a way of referring to or addressing more than one person. Some have objected to using it to address women or to address men and women at the same time. They argue that \u201cguys\u201d \u2014 a noun with a masculine heritage \u2014 implies that maleness is a default category. But then, as many of us have witnessed, often women use \u201cyou guys\u201d among themselves as readily as do men, and they have done so now for several decades.\n\nThat\u2019s because for many English speakers, \u201cguys\u201d has evolved from its heritage meaning of \u201cmen\u201d to just \u201cpeople.\u201d Like \u201cheads\u201d with cattle and \u201ctua\u201d with tables, it is still pronounced the same way as its progenitor word. But \u201cyou guys\u201d has morphed into a new meaning: a blank, functional way of referring to or addressing more than one human being, an option for the plural \u201cyou\u201d that English otherwise lacks. One more aspect of the squishiness of the relationship between words and meanings is how sheerly arbitrary they can be. How a word comes to express a particular meaning rather than another one is often no more subject to analysis than why a dropped slice of toast lands on the floor jam-side down one time but jam-side up another. Think of the difference between two words that are variations on the same one: \u201chuman\u201d and \u201chumane.\u201d No one can say precisely why \u201chumane\u201d took on a more refined and particular meaning and \u201chuman\u201d did not. Roll the dice again and it could have come out the other way, just as \u201cawful\u201d once had the same meaning as \u201cawesome\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cfull of awe\u201d \u2014 but soured into its current meaning, leaving the use of \u201cawfully\u201d in expressions like \u201cawfully good\u201d as a memento to its origins. Or did you ever notice, as my partner pointed out to me recently, that if you place the emphasis in the word \u201cintersection\u201d on the first syllable, it would be more readily understood as a place where you brake your car, but if you place the emphasis on the third syllable, it is more likely to be interpreted as a point of commonality between subjects or lines in space? Again, the cloud metaphor for words is instructive. In an eternal spin and churn cloaking the globe, the clouds endlessly shift, blend, split off new offshoots, evaporate and are born anew. Under this analogy, meanings are the solid landmasses down below. At any given point, a cloud has a particular shape and hovers over a particular area. But it may change over time. Next thing you know, \u201ccharacter\u201d no longer means a written symbol, as both Shakespeare and Henry James used it. In \u201cThe Ambassadors,\u201d Strether sees familiar handwriting and James notes that \u201che had dozens of well-filled envelopes superscribed in that character.\u201d But gradually the word wafts over to a related meaning: that which marks a person out as distinct in a way similar to what a written \u201ccharacter\u201d does \u2014 one\u2019s, as it were, personal \u201ccharacter.\u201d Evolving further, individuals with a remarkable aspect about them start being referred to as characters, and we have yet another new meaning. This mutable and sometimes random essence of language may seem shabby or untoward compared with the schematic, tamed one we are taught. But in the end, real language is dynamic. The fun is in looking back at how things have changed and always having an ear open to what might be next.

Now, a nonprofit is working to restore the shortgrass prairie, where the American icons and their ecosystem can thrive again.\n\nScott Heidebrink, the director of bison restoration for the American Prairie Reserve in northeast Montana, checks on a herd. \u201cThere are ways that bison were impacting the landscape that we haven\u2019t even thought about,\u201d he said.\n\nMALTA, Mont. \u2014 Around 200 chocolate-brown bison raise their heads, following the low growl of a pickup truck slowly motoring across the sagebrush-studded prairie. Snorting and quietly bellowing, their feral odors riding the wind, they slowly trot across the prairie hills, eager to maintain distance from the truck. This knot of bison \u2014 colloquially referred to as buffalo, though they are not the same species \u2014 is part of a project to rebuild a vast shortgrass prairie not only to return large numbers of bison here, but also to eventually restore the complex and productive grassland ecosystem the animals once engineered with their churning hooves, waste, grazing and even carcasses. \u201cWhen you have large numbers on the landscape, they impact everything,\u201d Scott Heidebrink, the director of bison restoration for American Prairie, a nonprofit conservation group, said of the animals. \u201cThere are ways that bison were impacting the landscape that we haven\u2019t even thought about.\u201d\n\nBetween 30 million and 60 million bison once roamed parts of the United States, primarily in the Great Plains. They were a \u201ckeystone\u201d species in a complex ecological web, creating a cascade of environmental conditions that benefited countless other species. Intact grasslands are very productive for biodiversity. In part because of the loss of bison and other megafauna, intact grassland biomes are now among the most endangered in the world, and the numbers of many species that depend on them have collapsed. Agriculture has also taken a huge toll on the prairies. \u201cIt\u2019s being plowed up fast and mismanaged for cattle,\u201d said Curt Freese, a wildlife biologist and one of the founders of American Prairie. Nearly a million acres in the eight-county region around the reserve have been converted to cropland in recent years, Dr. Freese said. The primary task here now, researchers and managers say, is to increase the number of bison and acres. In 2008, more than two dozen ecologists and experts, in a paper known as the Vermejo Statement, estimated that to foster a functioning prairie ecosystem at least 5,000 bison would need to be able to migrate freely on some 450,000 contiguous, fenceless acres. The first 16 bison were brought to American Prairie in 2005, and their numbers have grown to 774. The reserve has set a goal to settle 6,000 bison on 500,000 contiguous acres, Mr. Heidebrink said. The hardest part of the task, though, has been building up enough land. Someday, the bison on reservations, American Prairie and nearby wildlife refuges in the United States and Canada, may become one vast herd, roaming across about 3 million acres. Native American communities in Montana, including the Fort Belknap Reservation and Blackfeet Nation, already have herds of their own.\n\nA full-blown prairie ecosystem is still decades away, and it won\u2019t be cheap: Dr. Freese, who is writing a book about the return of wildlife to the plains, estimates it is likely to cost several hundred million dollars. Recent studies have demonstrated some of the important ecological effects that bison have on grasslands. A long-term comparative study of bison and cattle on tallgrass prairie in Kansas showed that over about 30 years on land grazed by bison, the richness of native plant species doubled compared with places where cattle grazed, and the presence of bison made the prairie ecosystem more resilient to drought. Widespread commercial hunting for bison\u2019s hides, and a strategy to eliminate them to force Native American tribes to submit to life on reservations, had nearly extirpated the animals in the United States by the 1880s, down to a few small herds around the West, including in Yellowstone National Park. Now, hundreds of thousands of bison are scattered across the West, but many scientists consider them \u201cecologically extinct\u201d because they no longer gather in large herds, roam freely across expansive landscapes and perform their ecological role. Even without those herds, bison act as \u201cecosystem engineers,\u201d improving not just their own habitats but those of myriad other species, including plants, birds and insects.\n\nThis is, in part, because bison graze less intensively across greater distances; tracking collars show they move more than three miles a day, while cattle travel about half as far. \u201cYou can have areas that are completely barren or areas that have really short grass or taller grass or shrubby or shady areas,\u201d said Hila Shamon, a research ecologist with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute who studies bison ecology on the preserve. \u201cDifferent species utilize these different little patches. They need that. If you don\u2019t have that complexity on the landscape, you are losing some of those species.\u201d\n\nWhile cattle can be managed to mimic some of these benefits, bison do so naturally. The way bison graze also creates more forage, and new forage is most nutritious for the ecosystem. \u201cThe same as if you mow down grass in your front yard,\u201d Dr. Shamon said. \u201cIf you mow it, it will grow back, it will regenerate. Bison have the same impact on grasslands. They mow the lawn and mow the lawn and create more and more productivity.\u201d In the winter, bison use their gigantic heads to clear away snow to get at the grass underneath. \u201cThat little patch gets more sunlight and all the urine that was deposited there, and increased moisture from spring events creates a rapid flush of succulent growth in the spring,\u201d said Wes Olson, a bison expert who worked to return the animal to Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan for Parks Canada.\n\nBecause bison can tolerate warmer temperatures than cattle can, they are considered better for the health of the streams that flow across the prairie. When the temperature reaches the low 80s, cattle seek out the cool waters of the creeks, eating and trampling vegetation and stream banks, while bison continue to graze the uplands. Many species of birds and deer, among others, use healthy riparian areas as well, which bison help to create and maintain. Replacing cattle with bison can be a passive way to restore the growth of shrubs and grasses along the streams that cattle graze over. More than 300 species of birds live in or migrate throughout the shortgrass prairie here, nourished by a diversity of insects that may thrive in part by the ways that bison wallow. Bison roll in the dust as a way to groom themselves and deter pests; as they do, they plant seeds carried in their coats and create depressions, where water collects to nourish those plants, creating new habitats for insects and birds. \u201cIn virtually every ecosystem currently grazed by bison, all of the grassland songbirds are lining their nest with bison hair,\u201d said Mr. Olson, the co-author of the book \u201cThe Ecological Buffalo,\u201d which details the many ways bison are connected to grassland ecosystems. \u201cIt insulates and increases chick survival and egg survival by up to 60 percent.\u201d\n\nEven in death, bison are critical players in the ecosystem: Their carcasses feed a variety of species, and as they decompose, they release nitrogen, potassium and other nutrients, a shot of adrenaline into the ecosystem. There are other reasons the bison herd here today is not yet the wild, free-roaming population American Prairie envisions. In Montana, bison are considered livestock, not wildlife, which means they are not free to roam. Some state officials are fiercely opposed to bison being designated as wildlife, like elk and deer, because, if they roamed freely on federal land and elsewhere, they would compete with cattle for food. Critical natural elements of a wild prairie, such as fires, are absent as well, meaning bison no longer follow ancient rhythms of migrating to find new grass that grows in the wake of a wildfire or rainstorm. However, those who began this project still believe a wild herd will eventually roam the prairie again. Until American Prairie can expand its herd, the group is donating surplus bison to neighboring Indian reservations. On a recent cold, sunny morning, members of the Little Shell Chippewa tribe, which only recently received federal recognition, picked up five young bison. \u201cThere are six bison herds all within a hundred miles of each other,\u201d said Dr. Freese. \u201cMy vision long term is to develop a comanagement system, where bison roam freely across that whole landscape. You could have a herd of 50,000 bison.\u201d",

I was struck by how dark Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cPinocchio\u201d was compared with the Disney animated version I saw as a child in South Jersey in the early 1960s. As I do every year, I\u2019ll tune in to the Golden Globes tonight and the Oscars in March. I\u2019ll be curious to find out if my picks will win best picture or other awards. Many people enjoy movies. But people are often surprised that I do, too, because I am legally blind. I don\u2019t watch a film the way a sighted person does, but the experience opens up a whole world for me. Like many other people who are legally blind, as I have been my whole life, I do have some vision. I see colors, I see motion, and I see faces, though I may not recognize whose faces they are unless they are very near. I can write on my iPad and computer and read on my Kindle if I enlarge the font enough. I can watch movies or TV if I\u2019m close to the screen.\n\nI owe my movie-maven status to my mom and dad, now deceased. They loved me. They hadn\u2019t met any blind or low-vision people before I was born, and maybe because of that, they never set rigid boundaries on what I should or shouldn\u2019t do. \u201cWe wanted you to do and enjoy as much as possible what the other kids did,\u201d my mother told me. And so the movies. Yearly, my folks took me to see an ophthalmologist. He was a kind man who saw the whole me, not just a pair of bad eyes. \u201cHer vision will always be impaired,\u201d he said to my folks, \u201cbut Kathi\u2019s still learning to use the vision she has.\u201d Watching movies, the good doctor advised, would encourage me to take in images. To look at people\u2019s faces and gestures. To notice what landscapes, houses and other spaces and places look like. My parents, film buffs, needed no encouragement to expose me to the silver screen. In my small town, every Saturday afternoon, kids lined up to go to the matinee at the local movie theater. Quarter in hand, I went with my pals to see the latest picture along with the trailers and cartoons that preceded it. My grandmother would tell me to smile when she took my picture, but I had no idea what a smile looked like. I didn\u2019t know what my dad was talking about when he\u2019d tell me not to curl my lip. I was later thrilled to discover what smiling and dancing looked like when I saw Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews in \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d I shivered as I looked into the deliciously evil eyes of Cruella de Vil in \u201c101 Dalmatians.\u201d\n\nAt the movies, for the first time, close to the giant silver screen, I could see clenched fists, grimaces, smiles, nods and other expressions and gestures. Back in the day, I would have had no idea of what a life hack was. But that\u2019s what movies have been for me. In real life, I frequently have trouble reading the room because I rarely see facial expressions, gestures or what people are wearing unless I\u2019m very close to them. I frequently miss visual information that gives sighted people clues about the people they date, fall in love with, marry, parent, socialize with and work with. I can\u2019t see how you gesture to get a server\u2019s attention when you\u2019re having dinner out or when you\u2019re flirting with me or rolling your eyes. I won\u2019t pretend that I see what sighted people see when they view movies, but I see enough. I also sometimes use audio description, a form of narration that gives blind and low-vision people access to visual elements in movies and other media. Yes, a lot of the time I can\u2019t tell what weapon is used in a murder mystery or the size of the engagement ring a lover has hidden in his beloved\u2019s dessert. But the sheer experience of film is what I love \u2014 the sense of images moving across the screen as we move through space and time. And because movies are on a big screen, with close-ups of lovers, musical numbers, battles and street scenes, I\u2019m able to view what I otherwise rarely can. My everyday life, like that of everyone I\u2019ve ever known, isn\u2019t like the movies. I\u2019m not, like Norma Desmond, getting ready for my close-up. I\u2019ve had some lovely romances but never as magical as in \u201cThe Philadelphia Story.\u201d I have moments of existential dread. But I\u2019m not Laurence Olivier in \u201cHamlet.\u201d Yet the imaginary world of the movies has helped me by giving me irreplaceable, even magical glimpses into how the world works. From watching films, I got my first idea of what people were talking about when they said someone was smirking, snarling or shrugging. Today I\u2019m not bewildered if I\u2019m asked to smile for a photo. One day, I\u2019ll learn how to roll my eyes. Movies have been a decoder ring that helped me make sense of the world. They\u2019ve taught me to go beyond \u2014 to picture beyond the rainbow and wild moonlight and even to take pride in how I see them in ways not everyone does. A blur, the need to get really close, to pay exquisite attention can be beautiful.",

Credit...Victor Moriyama para The New York Times\n\nTrabajadores gubernamentales limpiaban las instalaciones presidenciales el lunes, un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que una turba ingresara a ellas.\n\nDurante las \u00faltimas 10 semanas, los seguidores del expresidente de extrema derecha Jair Bolsonaro hab\u00edan acampado afuera de la sede del ej\u00e9rcito brasile\u00f1o, exigiendo que los militares revirtieran las elecciones presidenciales de octubre. Y, durante las \u00faltimas 10 semanas, los manifestantes encontraron poca oposici\u00f3n por parte del gobierno. Luego, el domingo, muchos de los ocupantes del campamento salieron de sus carpas en Brasilia, la capital del pa\u00eds, condujeron algunos kil\u00f3metros y, al unirse cientos de otros manifestantes, invadieron el Congreso, el Supremo Tribunal Federal y las oficinas presidenciales. Para la ma\u00f1ana del lunes, las autoridades estaban barriendo el campamento. Desmantelaron las carpas, retiraron pancartas y detuvieron a 1200 de los manifestantes, llev\u00e1ndoselos en autobuses para interrogarlos.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 se hab\u00eda permitido que un campamento que exig\u00eda un golpe militar creciera durante m\u00e1s de 70 d\u00edas era parte de un conjunto m\u00e1s amplio de preguntas que los funcionarios enfrentaban el lunes, entre ellas: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se permiti\u00f3 que las protestas se acercaran tanto a las sedes del poder de Brasil? \u00bfY por qu\u00e9 las fuerzas de seguridad hab\u00edan sido superadas de tal manera que multitudes de manifestantes pudieron irrumpir f\u00e1cilmente en las instalaciones gubernamentales?\n\nEl ministro de Justicia de Brasil, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, indic\u00f3 que varias agencias de seguridad se hab\u00edan reunido el viernes para prepararse ante la posibilidad de violencia en las protestas previstas para el domingo. Pero, dijo, la estrategia de seguridad urdida en la reuni\u00f3n, que inclu\u00eda mantener a los manifestantes alejados de los principales edificios estatales, para el domingo hab\u00eda sido parcialmente abandonada y hab\u00eda muchos menos agentes de la ley de lo previsto. \u201cEl contingente policial no fue lo que se hab\u00eda acordado\u201d, dijo, y a\u00f1adi\u00f3 que no estaba claro por qu\u00e9 se hab\u00edan cambiado los planes. Algunos en el gobierno federal culpaban al gobernador de Brasilia, Ibaneis Rocha, y sus funcionarios, dando a entender que hab\u00edan sido negligentes o c\u00f3mplices en la falta de personal de las fuerzas de seguridad alrededor de las protestas.\n\nEl domingo por la noche, Alexandre de Moraes, juez del Supremo Tribunal Federal, suspendi\u00f3 a Rocha de su cargo como gobernador durante al menos 90 d\u00edas, argumentando que el levantamiento \u201csolo pod\u00eda ocurrir con el consentimiento, e incluso la participaci\u00f3n efectiva, de las autoridades de seguridad e inteligencia\u201d. Independientemente de los fallos de seguridad que hayan ocurrido, los disturbios del domingo dejaron al desnudo de forma sorprendente el principal desaf\u00edo que enfrenta la democracia de Brasil. A diferencia de otros intentos por derrocar gobiernos en la historia de Am\u00e9rica Latina, los ataques del domingo no fueron ordenados por un solo gobernante autoritario o un ej\u00e9rcito decidido a tomar el poder, sino que m\u00e1s bien fueron impulsados por una amenaza m\u00e1s insidiosa y arraigada: un enga\u00f1o masivo.\n\nMillones de brasile\u00f1os parecen estar convencidos de que las elecciones presidenciales de octubre estuvieron ama\u00f1adas en detrimento de Bolsonaro, a pesar de que las auditorias y los an\u00e1lisis realizados por expertos no han hallado nada de ese tipo. Dichas creencias en parte son producto de a\u00f1os de teor\u00edas conspirativas, afirmaciones enga\u00f1osas y falsedades expl\u00edcitas que Bolsonaro y sus aliados propagaron al afirmar que el sistema de votaci\u00f3n totalmente electr\u00f3nico de Brasil estaba plagado de fraude. Los partidarios de Bolsonaro han estado repitiendo las afirmaciones durante meses, y luego las ampliaron con nuevas teor\u00edas de conspiraci\u00f3n transmitidas en chats grupales de WhatsApp y Telegram, muchos de los cuales se enfocaron en la idea de que el software de las m\u00e1quinas de votaci\u00f3n electr\u00f3nica fue manipulado para hacer fraude a la elecci\u00f3n. El domingo, los manifestantes se pararon en el techo del Congreso con una pancarta que ten\u00eda una sola exigencia: \u201cQueremos el c\u00f3digo fuente\u201d. La ma\u00f1ana del lunes, Orlando Pinheiro Farias, de 40 a\u00f1os, sal\u00eda del campamento de manifestantes y dijo que hab\u00eda ingresado a los despachos presidenciales el domingo junto a otros compa\u00f1eros en busca de documentos relacionados con \u201clas investigaciones del c\u00f3digo fuente, que legitiman que Jair Messias Bolsonaro es el presidente de Brasil\u201d. Recit\u00f3 varias siglas gubernamentales e investigaciones secretas sobre las que hab\u00eda le\u00eddo en internet, y luego dijo que ten\u00eda que volver a su tienda de campa\u00f1a para recuperar una bandera brasile\u00f1a que se hab\u00eda robado del edificio.\n\n\u201c\u00bfEscuchaste alguna vez del Caballo de Troya?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 Nathanael S. Viera, de 51 a\u00f1os, que hab\u00eda viajado m\u00e1s de 1400 kil\u00f3metros para participar en las protestas del domingo. \u201cLos infiltrados fueron y armaron todo y la maldita prensa le mostr\u00f3 a la naci\u00f3n brasile\u00f1a que nosotros los patriotas somos v\u00e1ndalos\u201d. Las escenas del domingo \u2014manifestantes de derecha envueltos en la bandera nacional deambulando por los pasillos del poder\u2014 resultaban sorprendentemente similares a las del asalto al Capitolio de los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero, al igual que las creencias confusas que llevaron a los manifestantes en ambos pa\u00edses a invadir edificios federales y a filmarse mientras lo hac\u00edan. \u201cA Donald Trump lo sacaron con una elecci\u00f3n ama\u00f1ada, sin duda, y en aquel momento lo sacaron y yo dije \u2018al presidente Bolsonaro lo van a derrocar\u2019\u201d, dijo Wanderlei Silva, de 59 a\u00f1os, trabajador hotelero retirado que estaba el lunes afuera del campamento. Silva hallaba sus propias similitudes entre los disturbios del domingo y los del 6 de enero de 2021. \u201cLos dem\u00f3cratas armaron eso e invadieron el Capitolio\u201d, dijo. \u201cIgual que aqu\u00ed lo armaron\u201d. Durante mucho tiempo, Brasil se ha visto a s\u00ed mismo como un pa\u00eds similar a Estados Unidos: diverso y vasto, rico en recursos naturales, distribuido en una colecci\u00f3n de estados federales y gobernado por un gobierno federal fuerte. Pero su tumultuosa historia pol\u00edtica nunca imit\u00f3 verdaderamente el sistema estadounidense, hasta los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.\n\n\u201cSin Trump no habr\u00eda Bolsonaro en Brasil. Y sin la invasi\u00f3n al Capitolio no habr\u00eda la invasi\u00f3n que vimos ayer\u201d, dijo Guga Chacra, comentarista en la mayor cadena de televisi\u00f3n de Brasil, quien vive en Nueva York y monitorea la pol\u00edtica en ambos pa\u00edses. \u201cEl bolsonarismo intenta copiar al trumpismo y los seguidores de Bolsonaro en Brasil intenta copiar lo que hacen los seguidores de Trump en Estados Unidos\u201d. Incluso una descripci\u00f3n de las elecciones presidenciales de Brasil de 2022 se lee como un resumen de las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020: un mandatario populista de extrema derecha con gusto por los insultos y tuits improvisados contra un contrincante septuagenario de izquierda que se postula con su probada trayectoria pol\u00edtica y una promesa de unir a una naci\u00f3n dividida.\n\nPero lo que pas\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de cada elecci\u00f3n fue distinto. Si bien el expresidente Donald Trump luch\u00f3 para revertir los resultados y llam\u00f3 a sus seguidores a descender al Capitolio el 6 de enero, Bolsonaro de hecho se hab\u00eda rendido y marchado a Florida para cuando sus votantes entraban a la fuerza a las oficinas que hab\u00eda ocupado alguna vez. Seg\u00fan dijo su esposa en redes sociales, Bolsonaro pas\u00f3 parte del lunes en un hospital de Florida debido a dolores abdominales derivados de un apu\u00f1alamiento que sufri\u00f3 en 2018. Bolsonaro planea quedarse en Florida durante las pr\u00f3ximas semanas o meses, con la esperanza de que se enfr\u00eden las investigaciones en Brasil sobre su actividad como presidente, seg\u00fan un amigo. Ned Price, el vocero del Departamento de Estado de EE. UU., no quiso hacer comentarios sobre el estatus de la visa de Bolsonaro, aludiendo a las leyes de privacidad. Pero indic\u00f3 que se esperaba que cualquier persona que ingresara al pa\u00eds con una visa diplom\u00e1tica y que \u201cya no est\u00e9 involucrada en asuntos oficiales en nombre de su gobierno\u201d saliera del pa\u00eds o solicitara otro tipo de visa dentro de 30 d\u00edas. \u201cSi un individuo no tiene bases para estar en Estados Unidos, dicho individuo es sujeto de ser expulsado\u201d, dijo Price.\n\nEn un discurso grabado en los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de su presidencia, Bolsonaro dijo que hab\u00eda intentado y fracasado en usar la ley para anular las elecciones de 2022, y sugiri\u00f3 que sus seguidores deber\u00edan seguir adelante. \u201cVivimos en una democracia o no\u201d, dijo. \u201cNadie quiere una aventura\u201d. El domingo, public\u00f3 un mensaje en Twitter condenando la violencia. Pero sus a\u00f1os de ret\u00f3rica contra las instituciones democr\u00e1ticas de Brasil, y su estrategia pol\u00edtica de infundir miedo a la izquierda entre sus seguidores, ya hab\u00edan dejado una marca imborrable. Entrevistas con manifestantes realizadas en semanas recientes parec\u00edan mostrar que el movimiento de Bolsonaro avanzaba sin \u00e9l. Ahora es impulsado por creencias profundamente arraigadas entre muchos brasile\u00f1os de derecha seg\u00fan las cuales las \u00e9lites pol\u00edticas ama\u00f1aron el voto para instalar como presidente a Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a quien consideran un comunista que convertir\u00e1 a Brasil en un estado autoritario como Venezuela.\n\nEn un discurso televisado la noche del lunes, Lula dijo que su gobierno procesar\u00eda a quienquiera que haya atacado la democracia de Brasil el domingo. \u201cEllos quieren un golpe de Estado y golpe no habr\u00e1\u201d, dijo. \u201cTienen que aprender que la democracia es lo m\u00e1s complicado que podemos hacer, porque nos exige aguantar a los dem\u00e1s, nos exige convivir con los que no nos caen bien\u201d. \u00c9l y muchos de los principales funcionarios del gobierno de Brasil luego fueron caminando juntos desde los despachos presidenciales hasta el Supremo Tribunal Federal, cruzando la misma plaza que un d\u00eda antes estaba atestada de turbas que ped\u00edan derrocar a su gobierno.",

            "content": "Ukrainian soldiers heading to the front line in the Donetsk region of Ukraine last month. Without some form of security guarantee for Ukraine after the war, experts say, it is hard to imagine the country will be able to rebuild and avoid future conflicts.\n\nAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.\n\nA postwar Ukraine will want to ensure that Russia does not attack again. But is there anything short of full NATO membership that will satisfy Kyiv and deter Moscow?\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Provide \u2018Security Guarantees\u2019 to Ukraine?\n\nBRUSSELS \u2014 One day the war in Ukraine will be over. How and when remain the field of prophecy. But one of the most important questions will be how to ensure the future security of Ukraine \u2014 and by whom. The possible answers are not easy and will depend on the outcome of the war. But what seems clear is that short of a Russian collapse and defeat, with Ukraine winning back all of its territory, any security guarantees are likely to be both partial and fragile. But without something, officials and analysts suggest, it is hard to imagine investors pouring back into Ukraine to rebuild the country \u2014 or that another war would not flare in the future. Much pivots on the hesitancy of the West itself, which wants to protect Ukraine but has shown that it does not want to fight for it, and that it does not want a direct military confrontation with Russia. Instead it has sought to thread a course between deterring Russia but not provoking it.\n\nThere will be \u201ca lot of risks around the corner for European and trans-Atlantic unity,\u201d said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome. If Ukraine manages to regain even the territory lost since Russia\u2019s invasion last year, she said, then there would be mounting voices in Europe and Washington saying, \u201cLook at the ongoing costs, civilian and military \u2014 hey, compromise.\u201d But Ukraine will want solid security commitments in return, she said, and that could divide the West \u2014 with Central and Eastern European countries demanding NATO membership for Ukraine, and Western European allies refusing. While NATO and the European Union have promised Ukraine membership, there is no deadline, and it is not certain those pledges will be fulfilled. The West\u2019s embrace of Ukraine was one reason cited by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his invasion in the first place. As long as territorial disputes remain, there is little likelihood that even a Ukraine in some sort of cease-fire agreement with Russia would win the unanimous support needed to join either institution. How the war ends will be crucial, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, who helped write a paper detailing the knotty issues involved in Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.\n\nThe prospect of a complete defeat of Russia, which could undermine Mr. Putin and his circle, embodies risks of Russian escalation that many NATO country leaders, including President Biden, seem unwilling to hazard. Should Mr. Putin\u2019s leadership collapse, key European states like France and Germany worry about what a chaotic, nuclear-armed Russia could portend, and even about a return to a \u201ctime of troubles,\u201d the years of lawlessness, infighting and anarchy that Russia experienced at the start of the 17th century. But anything short of NATO membership would involve promises that Kyiv already considers hollow. Those were tried before, in 1994, when the United States, Britain and Russia itself promised Ukraine territorial integrity and security \u201cassurances\u201d in return for giving up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons under an agreement called the Budapest Memorandum. Those assurances came with no commitments \u2014 from Russia, of course, but also from Washington and London \u2014 and proved worthless.\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, a former NATO secretary-general, has tried to square the circle in \u201cThe Kyiv Security Compact,\u201d a proposal he and his colleagues drafted in the autumn with Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. It aims to provide something workable between the hollow assurances of 1994 and full NATO and E.U. membership. The core recommendation is for Ukraine\u2019s allies to turn the country into a kind of hedgehog or a porcupine, one so well-armed that Russia would not try to swallow it again. To get there, it urges a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d between Ukraine and key Western countries, on a bilateral basis, for a \u201cmulti-decade effort\u201d to make Ukraine impregnable and capable of its own defense. Mr. Rasmussen has compared his proposal to the relationship between the United States and Israel, with lots of defense cooperation but no formal defense treaty. In essence, the proposal is alliance without membership, less a security guarantee to Ukraine than a major disincentive to Moscow. \u201cThe irony is that non-membership in NATO would require more of the West than membership, and for longer,\u201d said Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff. Others suggest that individual allies, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Poland, put their own troops into Ukraine postwar, the way NATO has put forward-based multinational brigades into NATO members states that border Russia.\n\nMr. Hodges believes that Ukraine, with the right longer-range weapons from a currently reluctant Washington, can defeat Russia and take back all occupied territory, including Crimea, by the end of August. \u201cThere is no way Ukraine will be safe and secure so long as Russia controls Crimea,\u201d he said. Crimea allows Russia to block the Sea of Azov, isolate Mariupol, hit Odesa and dominate the Black Sea, while claiming an exclusive economic zone around Crimea, limiting fishing and gas exploration, he said. The only real security guarantee for Ukraine is eventual NATO membership, Mr. Hodges argued. But whatever the outcome, he said, \u201cit must be based on the assumption that Russia won\u2019t respect it unless they\u2019re forced to.\u201d \u201cRussia cannot be rewarded and think that what they did has paid off with territorial gain or leverage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven if Ukraine gains NATO membership, it\u2019s a defensive alliance and comes with restraints,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said. Still, he said, it would be a mistake to underestimate the cynical creativity of diplomats. One could arrive at a point where negotiations produce a commitment for Ukrainian neutrality, but not disarmament, with language about security guarantees, \u201ceven if anyone not a politician would call them unrealistic,\u201d he said. He made the comparison to the Dayton Accords that concluded the Bosnian war, \u201can awkward acrobatic architecture that only served to end the war.\u201d Even this war will end, he said, and probably in negotiations. \u201cTotal victory for anyone seems unlikely,\u201d he said. So at some point, the diplomats will have to get creative, providing Ukraine some solid prospect of peace and security somehow underwritten by its allies.",

            "content": "Los cient\u00edficos creen que los jugadores de la NFL corren un mayor riesgo de sufrir cardiopat\u00edas debido al peso que ganan, aunque en su mayor parte sea m\u00fasculo. Una vez que los jugadores se retiran, es extremadamente dif\u00edcil perder el peso del f\u00fatbol americano, en parte debido al dolor cr\u00f3nico de las lesiones que sufrieron jugando. (Los jugadores de la NFL de entre 25 y 39 a\u00f1os tienen una tasa de artritis tres veces superior a la del p\u00fablico en general). Las muertes prematuras de estos hombres fueron una tragedia para sus seres queridos, amigos y antiguos compa\u00f1eros de equipo, pero por lo general el p\u00fablico no se enter\u00f3.\n\nLos trastornos neurol\u00f3gicos tambi\u00e9n son inc\u00f3modamente usuales entre los exjugadores de la NFL. Uche me hab\u00eda invitado hace poco a su p\u00f3dcast. Plane\u00e1bamos hablar de c\u00f3mo los jugadores de f\u00fatbol americano deber\u00edan interpretar los datos del estudio del Centro de ETC de la Universidad de Boston que muestran que alrededor del 90 por ciento de los m\u00e1s de 300 jugadores de la NFL del estudio que comenz\u00f3 en 2008 han tenido ETC, una enfermedad neurodegenerativa que est\u00e1 vinculada con el desarrollo de la demencia y en parte la causan las repetidas lesiones cerebrales traum\u00e1ticas. Aunque es poco probable que esos 300 jugadores de la NFL del estudio sean representativos de la poblaci\u00f3n total de la NFL, otro an\u00e1lisis sugiere que la prevalencia m\u00ednima en los jugadores de la NFL es del 10 por ciento, m\u00e1s de diez veces la de la poblaci\u00f3n general. Uche quer\u00eda que se hicieran pruebas de ETC en su cerebro despu\u00e9s de su muerte y su familia est\u00e1 cumpliendo su petici\u00f3n.\n\nEl da\u00f1o neurol\u00f3gico a causa de los repetidos traumatismos craneoencef\u00e1licos puede estar detr\u00e1s de los hallazgos relacionados con que los jugadores de la NFL sean tres veces m\u00e1s propensos a morir de esclerosis lateral amiotr\u00f3fica y 3,5 veces m\u00e1s propensos a morir de Parkinson que los jugadores del B\u00e9isbol de las Grandes Ligas. Los certificados de defunci\u00f3n suelen subestimar la demencia, pero una encuesta publicada el a\u00f1o pasado revel\u00f3 que los jugadores de la NFL de entre 50 y 59 a\u00f1os tienen diez veces m\u00e1s probabilidades de ser diagnosticados de demencia que la poblaci\u00f3n general.\n\nLos riesgos que sufren los jugadores de la NFL no se limitan a sus a\u00f1os en los equipos profesionales. El riesgo de ETC se determina en parte por la cantidad de tiempo que dure la carrera del jugador: mientras m\u00e1s tiempo alguien juegue f\u00fatbol americano, es m\u00e1s probable que sufra una mayor cantidad de impactos en la cabeza y lesiones cerebrales traum\u00e1ticas y corra un riesgo mayor. Por lo tanto, este riesgo tambi\u00e9n lo comparten los jugadores de f\u00fatbol americano universitario, de bachillerato e incluso juveniles, pues todos est\u00e1n expuestos al riesgo, la gran mayor\u00eda sin ninguna ventaja econ\u00f3mica y, en el caso de los ni\u00f1os, sin consentimiento informado.\n\nEspero que la conversaci\u00f3n sobre la seguridad en el f\u00fatbol americano que ha inspirado Damar Hamlin vuelva m\u00e1s seguro el juego para los jugadores j\u00f3venes que lo consideran un h\u00e9roe y quieren seguir sus pasos. Tambi\u00e9n espero que el p\u00fablico se centre en lo que podemos influir, como la forma en que gestionamos los factores de riesgo de las cardiopat\u00edas y el momento en el que metemos a nuestros hijos en el f\u00fatbol americano con tacleadas. Seg\u00fan un estudio de los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC, por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s), los jugadores juveniles de f\u00fatbol americano con tacleadas reciben un promedio de 389 impactos en la cabeza por temporada. Tal vez deber\u00edamos dejar de permitir golpes en las cabezas de los ni\u00f1os y presionar para que solo se juegue al f\u00fatbol americano con banderas antes del bachillerato. Y tal vez quienes se benefician de este deporte deber\u00edan empezar a asumir su responsabilidad. La NFL exige un promedio de 30 profesionales m\u00e9dicos en cada partido. Sin embargo, aunque los riesgos no terminan en el campo, la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica s\u00ed suele hacerlo.\n\nDamar Hamlin merece cada \u00e1pice de nuestra atenci\u00f3n, apoyo y respeto por haberse puesto en peligro para nuestro entretenimiento. Sigamos hablando de \u00e9l, de su familia, de sus compa\u00f1eros de equipo, de su ciudad y de los aficionados que lo han apoyado, adem\u00e1s de todo lo positivo que ha inspirado y representa, incluido el valor de la vida\u2026 incluso de las partes de ella que no quedan captadas en c\u00e1mara.\n\nChris Nowinski es neurocient\u00edfico conductual y director ejecutivo fundador de la organizaci\u00f3n sin fines de lucro Concussion Legacy Foundation. Despu\u00e9s de ser liniero defensivo en la Universidad de Harvard y uno de los mejores atletas de la alianza universitaria de las Ivy League, entr\u00f3 a la WWE, pero las conmociones cerebrales interrumpieron su carrera de luchador profesional.",

Mientras tanto, y en tiempo real, un pa\u00eds conmocionado era testigo de lo que suced\u00eda por la televisi\u00f3n y las redes sociales. La turba irrumpi\u00f3 en el Congreso, el Supremo Tribunal y el palacio presidencial. Las autoridades tardaron varias horas en restablecer el orden y detuvieron a cientos de personas. Con suerte, ese fue el \u00faltimo acto de los bolsonaristas, partidarios extremistas del expresidente Jair Bolsonaro, a quien una vez llamaron el Trump del tr\u00f3pico. Sin embargo, al igual que con el ataque del 6 de enero al Capitolio de Estados Unidos por parte de partidarios del expresidente Donald Trump, no est\u00e1 claro si este es el final de un movimiento pol\u00edtico o solo el comienzo de m\u00e1s divisi\u00f3n y caos. El nuevo presidente, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, ya se enfrentaba al complejo reto de unir a un pa\u00eds dividido, incluso sin tener a un expresidente bomb\u00e1stico en los m\u00e1rgenes y con muchos de sus partidarios ahora propensos a la violencia. Llevar ante la justicia a los responsables del atentado es un punto de partida crucial.\n\nEl 1 de enero, Lula tom\u00f3 posesi\u00f3n de su tercer mandato como presidente de Brasil en una ceremonia de investidura en Brasilia, a la que Bolsonaro no asisti\u00f3. Se supon\u00eda que iba a pasar la banda presidencial a Lula como s\u00edmbolo de una transici\u00f3n pac\u00edfica del poder. En vez de eso, opt\u00f3 por pasar los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de su presidencia y las primeras semanas del gobierno de Lula en Orlando, Florida, en una casa cerca de Disney World. Sin embargo, en los d\u00edas transcurridos desde su derrota electoral, muchos de los partidarios de Bolsonaro han acampado por todo el pa\u00eds, pensando que el expresidente preparar\u00eda un plan de \u00faltima hora. \u201cNo sabemos la fecha, no sabemos qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1, no sabemos d\u00f3nde, solo confiamos en nuestro presidente\u201d, me dijo uno de los seguidores del presidente. Al final no pas\u00f3 nada, as\u00ed que algunos miembros de la multitud tomaron justicia por mano propia. En los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, Bolsonaro ha afirmado en repetidas ocasiones que el sistema electoral puede ser manipulado. Cuando Bolsonaro dijo que solo hab\u00eda tres alternativas para su futuro \u2014prisi\u00f3n, muerte o victoria\u2014 no mencion\u00f3 una cuarta opci\u00f3n: ir a comer pollo frito a Estados Unidos, como fue fotografiado haciendo en diciembre. Al final, los elementos necesarios para una insurrecci\u00f3n exitosa simplemente no estaban all\u00ed. El presidente derrotado no contaba ni con el apoyo institucional ni con el apoyo p\u00fablico que necesitaba para hacer que los militares se pusieran de su lado. Para empezar, carec\u00eda de aliados. En cuanto se anunci\u00f3 la derrota electoral de Bolsonaro, algunos de sus aliados pol\u00edticos felicitaron al nuevo presidente electo. Otros presidentes latinoamericanos hicieron lo mismo. Las felicitaciones de Joe Biden llegaron en la misma noche electoral y fueron anunciadas en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n brasile\u00f1os como un importante respaldo a la transparencia del proceso electoral. Lo m\u00e1s importante es que la derrota de Bolsonaro provoc\u00f3 entre sus votantes una protesta mucho m\u00e1s leve de lo que se tem\u00eda, aunque no por ello dej\u00f3 de ser disruptiva. Algunos de sus partidarios bloquearon carreteras e incendiaron veh\u00edculos para tratar de paralizar el pa\u00eds. Cientos m\u00e1s decidieron instalar tiendas de campa\u00f1a frente a los cuarteles del ej\u00e9rcito en distintas ciudades del pa\u00eds, pidiendo que los militares intervinieran. \u201cS.O.S., fuerzas armadas\u201d, gritaban, a menudo alternando consignas marciales con ave mar\u00edas y el himno nacional.\n\nSemanas m\u00e1s tarde, todas las carreteras se hab\u00edan despejado. Quedaban algunos campamentos, entre ellos uno en el barrio de Santana de S\u00e3o Paulo, mi ciudad natal. En Navidad, pas\u00e9 parte de la tarde hablando con una decena de partidarios de Bolsonaro acampados all\u00ed. Segu\u00edan creyendo que las elecciones hab\u00edan sido manipuladas. La prueba m\u00e1s contundente de los bolsonaristas con los que habl\u00e9 lleg\u00f3 en forma de pregunta: \u201cSi todo mundo est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 gan\u00f3 la minor\u00eda?\u201d. Insistieron en que Lula no ser\u00eda juramentado. \u201cEstamos seguros de que no lo har\u00e1\u201d, dijo una mujer de casi 70 a\u00f1os. (Las personas con las que habl\u00e9 rechazaron dar sus nombres por temor a su seguridad). Cuando pregunt\u00e9 qu\u00e9 era lo que podr\u00eda ocurrir, la mujer insinu\u00f3 dos posibilidades: llamaban a los militares para apoyar un golpe presidencial \u2014tal como quer\u00edan los bolsonaristas\u2014 o los \u201cbuenos ciudadanos\u201d saldr\u00edan a las calles \u2014tambi\u00e9n supuestamente bajo las instrucciones de Bolsonaro\u2014 para asegurarse de que se mantuviera en el poder. El gobierno de Lula, una coalici\u00f3n amplia de fuerzas democr\u00e1ticas, llevar\u00e1 al pa\u00eds al comunismo, me dijeron los seguidores del expresidente. Por eso pidieron la intervenci\u00f3n militar mientras interpretaban supuestos mensajes secretos que Bolsonaro les habr\u00eda enviado en c\u00f3digo Morse. (S\u00ed, pasaron tiempo intentando descifrar el golpeteo de los dedos de Bolsonaro sobre un escritorio durante su \u00faltima transmisi\u00f3n en vivo). Lo cierto es que el capital pol\u00edtico de Bolsonaro ha disminuido. Cuando abandon\u00f3 el pa\u00eds, su vicepresidente, el general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, dijo a la naci\u00f3n: \u201cLa alternancia del poder en una democracia es saludable y debe ser preservada\u201d. Tambi\u00e9n se refiri\u00f3 sin rodeos a \u201cdirigentes que deb\u00edan tranquilizar y unir a la naci\u00f3n en torno a un proyecto de pa\u00eds\u201d, pero que en cambio hab\u00edan fomentado un clima de caos y colapso social. Auch. Parece que incluso las fuerzas armadas solo quieren una transici\u00f3n tranquila al poder para poder seguir siendo una clase privilegiada sin demasiadas responsabilidades. Algunos de los antiguos aliados de Bolsonaro en el Congreso apoyan ahora a Lula, y el \u00cdndice de Popularidad Digital del expresidente, que rastrea una consultora, ha ca\u00eddo m\u00e1s de la mitad desde su punto m\u00e1s alto. Sin embargo, los bolsonaristas m\u00e1s ac\u00e9rrimos no se van a ir en silencio. No fue sino hasta el lunes que quitaron sus tiendas de campa\u00f1a en S\u00e3o Paulo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y otras ciudades. En Brasilia, las autoridades desmantelaron campamentos y hasta el momento han detenido al menos a 1200 personas. Los seguidores de Bolsonaro llevaban m\u00e1s de dos meses esperando que se produjera un milagro. Y, cuando no ocurri\u00f3, intentaron tomar medidas por la fuerza. En respuesta, Lula firm\u00f3 un decreto de emergencia que permite al gobierno federal intervenir y restablecer el orden en la capital. Estar\u00e1 en vigor hasta finales de mes. Un juez del Supremo Tribunal destituy\u00f3 de su cargo de manera temporal al gobernador del distrito federal. Se ha iniciado una investigaci\u00f3n para identificar a los alborotadores y a sus patrocinadores financieros. El lunes, al menos una integrante del Congreso pidi\u00f3 al gobierno que solicitara la extradici\u00f3n de Bolsonaro.",
