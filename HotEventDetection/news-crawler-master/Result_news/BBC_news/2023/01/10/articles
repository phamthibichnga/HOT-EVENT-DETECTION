            "description": "Petrol at lowest price since Russia invaded Ukraine, but diesel still costs more than last year.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Average petrol prices have fallen below 150p a litre for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, the AA motoring group says.\n\nPump prices hit 149.74p per litre on Monday, lower than last February and down from a record 191.53p in July.\n\nThe AA said falling global oil prices were behind the drop, calling it \"a huge relief for drivers\".\n\nBut it said diesel still cost more than last year at 172.21p a litre compared with 153.05p.\n\nAA spokesman Luke Bosdet said it now cost about \u00a323 less to fill an average-sized 55-litre car with petrol than it did in July, at roughly \u00a382.\n\nHowever, he said petrol prices were \"still historically way above\" what they should be and that the end of a temporary fuel duty cut this March could lead to fresh rises.\n\nPetrol stations in cities and towns are also charging up to 10p more for fuel than those in rural parts of the UK, he added.\n\nFuel prices began to rise last year as countries ended Covid lockdowns but surged higher when Russia - a major oil producer - invaded Ukraine, sparking concerns about global supplies.\n\nBy July last year, the cost of filling an average-sized car had hit \u00a3105.29, according to the RAC motoring group, while for diesel it was \u00a3109.47.\n\nThe government has cut fuel duty by 5p a litre since February last year to help drivers, with the overall cut worth 6p when VAT is factored in, the AA says.\n\nHowever, the discount is scheduled to end in March.\n\nDavid Cox, an independent energy analyst, told the BBC that concerns over global oil supplies had subsided as countries had found alternatives to Russian crude, sending prices lower.\n\nHowever, he warned oil prices were likely to rise again as China eased its strict Covid rules and fully reopened its economy.\n\n\"I think the outlook [for oil and petrol prices] is it will go back up. We're in for a prolonged period of higher prices.\"\n\nThe news comes as the RAC said the cost of rapid-charging an electric car using a public charging network had increased by about 50% in the past eight months.\n\nIt now costs an average of 70.32p per kilowatt hour to rapid charge on a pay-as-you-go basis, up from 44.55p last May and from 63.29p last September, the motoring group said.\n\nThe rises - which are being driven by increasing energy costs - mean that drivers now pay \u00a336 to charge a typical family-sized electric car with a 64kWh battery to the level required to cover around 188 miles, it said.\n\nHowever, it added that those who charged at home were still getting \"great value\", paying about half as much.\n\nThe RAC's electric vehicles spokesman, Simon Williams, said cutting the level of VAT on electricity sold at public chargers to 5% to match what people pay at home would be one way of keeping prices under control.\n\n\"It continues to be the case that those who can charge at home or at work and who don't use the public rapid charging network very often get fantastic value - even given the relatively high domestic energy prices right now.\n\n\"Sadly, the same can't be said for people who either can't charge at home or at work, or who regularly make longer journeys beyond the range of their cars. There's no question they have to pay far more, and in some cases more than petrol or diesel drivers do to fill up on a mile-for-mile basis.\"",

            "description": "Total retail sales jumped by almost 7% but price rises meant shoppers bought less but spent more.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "Retail sales jumped by 6.9% in December but were driven by higher prices rather than people buying more, figures show.\n\nThere was also a \"healthy\" rise in like-for-like sales from last December, according to the British Retail Consortium and accountancy firm KPMG.\n\nMindful of rising household bills, shoppers invested in energy-saving products and warm clothing.\n\nBut the overall sales rise \"is largely due to goods costing more\", said KPMG's head of retail Paul Martin.\n\nHe added that it \"masks the fact that the volume of goods that people are buying is significantly down on this time last year\".\n\nThe rate of price rises - or inflation - hit 10.7% in November which is the fastest pace in 40 years.\n\nUK retail sales increased 6.5% on a like-for-like basis from December 2021, when they had increased by 0.6%.\n\nFood and drink sales for December, which includes the key festive period, jumped by 8% in the first Christmas since all Covid restrictions were lifted.\n\nThe last week of trading in the run up to Christmas saw the biggest amount of cash ever recorded through the tills in the grocery sector.\n\nBut again, this was down to rising prices while the volume of goods bought was \"essentially flat\", according to retail analysis group IGD.\n\nHowever Susan Barratt, chief executive of IGD, said: \"The flat volume number is an improvement on the rest of 2022, showing that Christmas still had the power to shift the direction of the market.\"\n\nBarclaycard, which has published separate figures on consumer spending on credit and debit cards during December, said there was evidence that shoppers had started stocking up for Christmas in November.\n\nIt meant that \"supermarket growth slowed as many Brits stocked up on festive food and drink earlier than usual to help spread costs and avoid shortages\".\n\nThere had been fears that the all important festive season would be a washout for retail given the cost of living crisis. These figures show its turned out better than expected.\n\nThe jump in sales looks healthy but the growth is still below the rate of inflation. People spent more over Christmas but bought significantly less. Clothes, beauty items and energy efficient household appliances did well. Food sales were also strong.\n\nBut things look set to get tougher now. With credit card bills landing and many consumers coming under more financial pressure from increasing living costs, there's a warning of high street casualties as we head into spring.\n\nMajor retailers including Sainsbury's, Tesco and Marks & Spencer will publish updates this week on trading over the Christmas period.\n\nBoth the BRC and KPMG said there was evidence that shoppers braved cold weather and overcame train strikes to visit shops with online non-food sales falling 3% during December, when Royal Mail staff staged a number of strikes.\n\nBarclaycard said: \"Postal strikes hampered online retail meaning shoppers headed to the high street for last-minute gifts.\"\n\nOverall, Barclaycard said that spending on credit and debit cards rose by 4.4% in December. Christmas parties and the FIFA World Cup boosted spending at pubs, bars and clubs while people also looked ahead to invest in holidays for 2023.\n\nHowever, Barclaycard also said that it had seen spending on utilities rise by 40.6% in December \"as the drop in temperature led more households to increase their heating\".\n\nAnd looking forward, higher living costs are expected to weigh on consumers' budgets and the retail sector.\n\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: \"Retail faces further headwinds in 2023. Cost pressures show little immediate signs of waning, and consumer spending will be further constrained by increasing living costs.\n\n\"Retailers are juggling big cost increases while trying to keep prices as low as possible for their customers.\"",

which include planned walkouts by ambulance drivers, bus drivers, teachers and driving examiners - are all expected to go ahead.\n\nNurses in England are also set to walk out for two days next week.\n\nElaine Sparkes, from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said the talks were \"more constructive\" than previous meetings but \"there is nothing tangible on the table\" and the union would announce strike dates later this week.\n\nWatch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.\n\nA government source said the health secretary discussed productivity and efficiency savings which would help decide what was affordable for the coming year's pay deal.\n\nA one-off payment for health service staff was mentioned in passing, the source said.\n\nUnions have repeatedly called for a better pay offer to be on the table before April and are said to have asked Mr Barclay to make that case to the chancellor.\n\nThe source said Mr Barclay had agreed to look at their request, without making any commitments.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEarlier, there were also meetings between Education Secretary Gillian Keegan and teaching unions.\n\nFollowing the talks, Kevin Courtney, from the National Education Union (NEU), said \"no concrete progress\" was made and there was no new pay offer.\n\n\"There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action,\" he said.\n\nHowever, in a statement he later said there was a promise of further discussions on changes to pay for this year.\n\nTeaching unions covering England and Wales, including the NEU, the NAHT and the NASUWT, are currently balloting members on potential strike action.\n\nIn Scotland, teachers are striking for two days this week, with a week-long industrial action planned for next week.\n\nThe day of talks come as a ballot opens for junior doctors in England to decide on their own industrial action, which could begin in March.\n\nAre you taking part in the strikes?

Given that this is the point of industrial action, this may well dilute the impact certain employees can have during disputes.\n\nThis is all happening while there seems to be signs ministers and some unions are starting to make progress towards agreements to end current strikes (though this is far from guaranteed).\n\nWhile there may be a \u201cchink of light\u201d (as one union put it at the weekend) in the current situation, the government may well want to avoid being in the same position at some point in the future, and this legislation could help with that.\n\nThough obviously it will be fiercely opposed by the union movement.\n\nWhile Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has had a slightly tetchy relationship with a number of union leaders during recent strikes (he told his frontbenchers to avoid picket lines) the party is sticking to its trade union roots on this issue, insisting they would repeal this legislation.",

It was a message from Meg: \"Call me when you get this.\"\n\n\"I looked at the BBC website. My grandmother had died. My father was King,\" writes Prince Harry.\n\nThis account adds previously unknown detail to the events surrounding the Queen's death last September - and reveals that the news first reached Prince Harry not from his family, but from the online news on his phone, as he arrived on a charter flight from Luton airport.\n\nIt might also clarify some confusion on the day of the Queen's death, when it was first thought that Meghan was travelling with Harry, but it later emerged that she wasn't.\n\nPrince William's wife, Catherine, also did not go to Balmoral, the Scottish estate where the Queen had spent her last summer.\n\nIn Prince Harry's account, he says his father told him not to bring Meghan with explanations that \"didn't make any sense, and actually they were disrespectful. I didn't tolerate it\".\n\n\"Don't even think about speaking about my wife like that,\" Prince Harry recalls saying to his father.\n\n\"Regretful, he stammered that he simply didn't want it to fill up with people. Nobody's wife was going, not even Kate, he told me, so Meg shouldn't either.\n\n\"'Then you should have started with that,\" says Prince Harry's recollection.\n\nThe book, translated from a Spanish edition, reveals details from the prince's final conversation with the late Queen, which he thought about as he travelled up to Balmoral - including a joke about his own thinning hair.\n\n\"I spent almost the whole flight looking at the clouds, reliving the last time I'd spoken to my grandmother. We'd been chatting at length four days before.\n\n\"We touched on lots of issues. Her health of course, the chaos in Downing Street, the Braemar Games, which she was sorry not to have been able to attend because she wasn't well.\n\n\"We also spoke about the devastating drought. Meg and I were staying at Frogmore and the lawn was in a really bad state.\n\n\"It's like my head, granny, full of bald spots and brown patches!' She burst out laughing. I told her to take care of herself and that I hoped we'd see each other soon.\"\n\nBut by the time he landed he saw the news about the Queen's death.\n\n\"I put on my black tie, got out of the plane under heavy rain and raced up to Balmoral in a borrowed car.\"",

            "section": "Reality Check",
            "content": "Just one week after the inauguration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil, thousands of supporters of the previous incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the country's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace.\n\nThe president said security forces in the capital, Bras\u00edlia didn't do enough to stop them. We've looked into the key moments and how the police responded.\n\nSince the narrow election win in October by the left-wing president, better known as Lula, supporters of his right-wing rival had been setting up camps in front of military barracks in many cities around the country.\n\nHis most ardent supporters have been calling for the army to intervene and overturn the election result.\n\nThen over the weekend, thousands of people gathered outside the army barracks in Bras\u00edlia, many of them brought in by bus.\n\nPresident Lula called on local security forces to remove these protesters, but police had opted to not use force.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the protesters set off on a march towards the complex of government buildings. Video footage shows the march peacefully under way, with military police escorting them along the 7km (four mile) route.\n\nWe have asked the police authorities in Bras\u00edlia whether the protesters had been granted official permission to march along this route ahead of time. We haven't yet received a response.\n\nThe protesters arrived at barriers blocking access to the complex of government buildings known as \"Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes\" (Three Powers Square).\n\nA video verified by the BBC shows only a single line of metal barriers across a road through a relatively open area.\n\nOne of the policemen can be seen pulling out what appears to be pepper spray or tear gas, aiming it at the protesters, who quickly force their way through.\n\nWe have asked the police why they hadn't organised stronger barriers and mobilised more officers to control the situation once the protesters approached the government square.\n\nOnce the barriers had been breached, crowds flooded onto ramps which led to the Congress building and the presidential palace.\n\nPolice have been criticised for being too hands-off with the protesters as they streamed in.\n\nTwo videos we've verified shows policemen taking pictures of the crowds as they walk up the ramps and into the Congress building.\n\nAnother video shows a policeman being pulled from his horse by protesters as they approach the Congress building and thrown to the ground.\n\nThe National Congress and the presidential palace were breached just before 15:00 local time.\n\nVideos show protesters using security barricades to smash through several large windows before entering, spreading throughout both buildings and onto the roof of Congress.\n\nThe BBC has also verified this video which shows police standing by as protesters walk up a staircase into the Congress building through the lower floor entrance.\n\nPolice holding riot shields are standing on the right of the stairs, but they aren't protecting the main entrance and appear to be guarding a side corridor instead.\n\nOne policeman waves the protesters through and gives them a thumbs up. As the crowd move forward into the building, some of them applaud the security personnel.\n\nFrom the police uniforms seen in the video it looks like they are part of the Policia Legislativa, the Federal police group that works inside Congress.\n\nShortly afterwards, a group also smashed windows of the Supreme Court and entered the building.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nImages show that once inside the buildings, protesters destroyed furniture, equipment and works of art.\n\nSocial media posts from the afternoon of 8 January clearly show scores of protestors both outside in the plaza and milling around inside buildings, in some cases with no police or security forces visible.\n\nVideos circulating online showed protesters trashing offices, smashing windows and doors, flipping furniture, and tossing computers and printers to the ground.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe governor of Bras\u00edlia, Ibaneis Rocha, eventually requested support from the national government - although it's not clear when exactly this was made.\n\nPresident Lula announced soon afterwards that he had authorised national forces to intervene in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nEven with the involvement of additional forces, it took many more hours to bring the situation under control. The Supreme Court was the first to be cleared. Then, as more forces arrived, other buildings were also gradually emptied.",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "Europe experienced its warmest summer and second warmest year in 2022\n\nThe polar regions and Europe were hit hardest by global warming in 2022, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe data from Copernicus, the EU's climate monitoring service, says 2022 was the fifth warmest year globally.\n\nEurope experienced its warmest summer, with temperatures increasing by more than twice the global average over the past three decades, faster than any other continent.\n\nThe last eight years are now also the warmest eight yet recorded.\n\nLast year saw a continuation of a pattern of global warming that has become the new normal, say Copernicus scientists.\n\nWhile the La Ni\u00f1a weather event helped to cool the oceans for the third year in a row, global temperatures were still approximately 0.3C higher in 2022 than the 1991-2020 reference period.\n\nResearchers say this means that last year was close to 1.2C above the 1850-1900 period, taken as the start of global industrialisation.\n\nEurope and the polar regions were at the sharp end of this high heat.\n\nTemperature records in many western European countries were broken including the UK, with summer heatwaves and intense droughts hitting many parts.\n\nEven the normally cooler month of October in Europe was some 2C above average last year.\n\nWhile the west of the continent was extremely hot, colder weather in northern and eastern countries saw the year overall drop to second warmest in Europe.\n\n\"We're already experiencing climate change now,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\n\"The heatwaves that we saw in Europe over the summer, but also the spring, and also the autumn ... many people will remember the heatwave that we had over the New Year's period as well. So we're seeing heatwaves, not only in the summer, but in the rest of the seasons.\"\n\nOver the past 30 years, temperatures in European countries have increased by more than twice the global average.\n\nAccording to the Copernicus service, Europe has the highest rate of temperature increase of any continent in the world.\n\nThis is due to a number of factors, say researchers. Land areas are warming faster than the seas, so this is helping make Europe warmer. Another factor is proximity to the Arctic, which is warming at around four times the global average.\n\nPart of the reason is that ice is more reflective and less absorbent of sunlight. When ice melts it reveals darker areas of land or sea, and this results in increased sunlight absorption and thus warming.\n\nApart from Europe there were significant record heat events in the Middle East, Central Asia and China with heatwave conditions in Pakistan and parts of India.\n\nThe two polar regions again saw record high heat with temperatures in some places rising by more than 2C above the 1991-2020 average.\n\nIn north-western Siberia, temperatures reached 3C above the average.\n\nAt Vostok in Antarctica, the mercury reached -17.7C, the warmest in the weather station's 65-year history.\n\nThe centre of Greenland also recorded values that were 8C higher than average during September.\n\nLooking at the global picture, the last eight years were all more than 1C above the long term average.\n\nThis is getting closer to breaching the 1.5C threshold that's a key limit for the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\"If we do a fairly simple linear extrapolation, and if we look at the current level of emissions and current level of warming, we will hit 1.5C sometime in the early 2030,\" said Samantha Burgess.\n\nDrought hit many parts of Europe including France where the River Loire dried up\n\n\"So we're already living on borrowed time effectively and borrowed emissions as well.\"\n\nLast year also saw the impact of a number of extreme events linked to climate change, with flooding in Pakistan perhaps the most destructive, with large loss of life.\n\nAcross the world, levels of warming gases also increased, with methane going up by more than the average of recent years.\n\nAnother cause for concern will be the carbon output from forest fires, with France, Germany, Spain and Slovenia all experiencing their highest summer wildfire emissions in 20 years.\n\nFurther insight into the state of the climate in 2022 will come later this week when a number of other meteorological agencies will report their data.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Railway workers would be obliged to maintain a specified minimum service level under the new laws\n\nThe government wants to lessen the impact of strikes in half a dozen public services.\n\nBut what difference will its planned new law make, and by when?\n\nMinisters picked their moment to set out their plans: on a day when train drivers had walked out, and within hours of the Labour leader's new year speech, poaching some of Keir Starmer's limelight.\n\nThe planned new law will see the light of day early next week, I'm told, when it is given what's called its first reading in the Commons.\n\nIt is then expected that it will have its second reading - when MPs get a chance to debate it - the week after next.\n\nMinisters don't anticipate their plans encountering any significant problems in the Commons, where the government has a sizeable majority, but that is far from the end of it.\n\nThat's because its next stop will be the House of Lords, where the numbers are much less favourable for the government.\n\nAnd then there is the possibility of legal challenges too. The trades unions are incensed by the plans.\n\nSo, in short, these ideas, even if they do become law, won't make any difference as far as this winter's strikes are concerned - and they might not make any difference for rather a while.\n\nIn the short term at least, they represent a battle over principles rather than a battle over consequences.\n\nAnd it is a battle where the Conservatives and Labour have very different instincts.\n\nKeir Starmer told me if Labour wins the next election he would get rid of this new law. Ministers, though, hope their argument will be seen as pragmatic.\n\nThey have decided against outright bans on strikes in any new sector. One senior figure said such a move would have been \"very draconian\".\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nInstead, they want minimum service levels in crucial public services - you can read more of the detail here.\n\nCrucially, what we don't know yet is precisely what those minimum service levels might be.\n\nHow many trains would run on a day when rail workers were on strike? What category of emergency would justify an ambulance being sent to you, when ambulance workers are on strike?\n\nThese details will be worked through in consultations, due to start imminently.\n\nMeanwhile, minsters in relevant departments are inviting union leaders in to see them, about the next financial year's pay settlements.\n\nAgain, they hope to be seen to be pragmatic, but union leaders say there is nothing pragmatic about saying your door is open but having nothing to offer on the table once you're sat around it.\n\nBut the view in government is they have no option but to be tough on the strikes, because there isn't any money left.\n\nThe argument goes that ministers can't borrow the money, for fear of spooking the markets as former prime minister Liz Truss did, there is no appetite to put up taxes, they think, and there's no spare money in existing budgets.\n\nYes, it is projected the rate of inflation could fall considerably before too long.\n\nBut we should still expect, given everything you have just read, that relations between the government and trades unions will, probably, show little sign of vast improvement any time soon.",

            "content": "Online retail giant Amazon has said it plans to shut three warehouses in the UK, putting 1,200 jobs at risk.\n\nHowever, the company also said it planned to open two new centres creating 2,500 jobs over the next three years.\n\nThe three warehouses being closed are in Hemel Hempstead, Doncaster and Gourock, in the west of Scotland.\n\nThe firm said staff at the sites being closed would be offered the chance to move to other Amazon locations.\n\nLast week, Amazon said it planned to cut more than 18,000 jobs globally, the largest number in the firm's history, in an attempt to reduce costs.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told the BBC that the decision to close the UK warehouses was made after a review of operations in the country and was \"completely unrelated\" to the wider cuts, which primarily affect office staff.\n\nThe firm said the new warehouses would be \"state of the art\" robotic facilities located in Peddimore, West Midlands, and Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham.\n\n\"We're always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our employees and customers,\" the company said.\n\nAmazon also plans to close seven delivery stations in England, which employ dozens of workers, and open two new ones in Havant and Aylesford.\n\nThese will replace existing stations in Portsmouth and Aylesford.\n\nStations, which prepare orders for delivery, will also close in Birmingham, Hemel Hempstead, Huntingdon, Horley, and Newcastle.\n\nThe online giant, which launched in the UK in 1998, expanded rapidly during the pandemic.\n\nIt currently employs about 70,000 people in the UK, including 400 workers at the Doncaster centre, 500 at Hemel Hempstead and 300 at Gourock.\n\nThe firm operates two other warehouses in Doncaster as well as one in Dunstable, about 20 minutes drive from Hemel Hempstead, which Amazon said may be able to absorb staff affected by the closures.\n\nBut Steve Garelick, GMB union officer for Hemel Hempstead, called the moves a \"real kick in the teeth for Amazon staff who worked themselves into the ground during the festive rush\".\n\nIt may be difficult for workers to take roles further away from their homes, he added.\n\n\"Hard-up Amazon workers can't suddenly be expected to up sticks and move to a different fulfilment centre which may be many miles away,\" he said.\n\nKaty Clark, Labour MSP for West of Scotland, called the decision to shut the Gourock warehouse after 19 years in the area \"appalling\".\n\nShe added: \"This is devastating for the local community and the 300 workers who may find themselves out of a job.\n\n\"These workers have been heroic supporting households and providing vital supplies throughout the pandemic and holiday periods.\n\n\"The Scottish Government needs to intervene as a matter of urgency to support these workers back into employment.\"\n\nAmazon has faced growing pressure over workers' rights since the pandemic.\n\nHundreds of workers at a warehouse in Coventry voted last month to stage what is believed to be the first strike action at the company in the UK. The walkout, part of a row over pay, is set to happen on 25 January.",

This is similar to the UK and the US, but Japan is also restricting flights from China to certain Japanese cities.\n\nBeijing's embassies in both Seoul and Tokyo confirmed the new visa restrictions for visitors to China.\n\nChina reopened its borders on Sunday for the first time since March 2020 as part of scrapping of its \"zero-Covid\" policy.\n\nReacting to China's latest visa restrictions, South Korea's foreign ministry told the BBC that its policy towards arrivals from China was \"in accordance with scientific and objective evidence\".\n\nAccording to South Korea's Disease Control and Prevention Agency, around a third of all arrivals from China tested positive for Covid prior to the visa restrictions being put in place.\n\nAt Seoul's Incheon International airport - the only South Korean airport still allowing flights from China - arrivals are met by military personnel in personal protective equipment.\n\nThe BBC managed to speak to some of them as they were escorted to the airport testing centre.\n\n\"Personally, I think it's OK. I have been through much worse during this pandemic,\" said William, a businessman from Shanghai. \"As a traveller I just try to comply with the policies are much as possible.\"\n\n\"In my mind it's not scientific at all,\" said Emily, who arrived from Hong Kong. She, like those coming from mainland China, was required to test.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit unfair on this side. They must feel really unsafe, I suppose.\"\n\nMany South Koreans support the idea of protecting their country from China's coronavirus surge - but not all are convinced that the decision is a purely medical one.\n\n\"There is a political element to it and the relationship between the two countries isn't a good one. A lot of Korean people hold a lot of animosity blaming China for the coronavirus,\" said Jinsun, who was heading to Abu Dhabi.\n\nAnother woman going on her honeymoon to Paris said South Korea might not have implemented such rules if the country concerned wasn't China.\n\n\"But then again, whatever we did, China would have a problem with it,\" she said.\n\nThe South Korean curbs are supposed to last at least until the end of the month, which would give scientists time to analyse for any potential new variants coming from China.\n\n\"There's no transparency at the moment in China about any monitoring for new variants. If a new variant comes from China, it would be a very difficult situation for the whole world,\" Professor Kim Woo Joo, an infectious diseases expert at Korea University and a government adviser, told the BBC.\n\n\"It would also be a disaster for the Korean healthcare system. We currently have a lot of hospitalisations and deaths already and our elderly people are also under-vaccinated. This is what we are worried about.\"\n\nAt the moment, only a small number of business or diplomatic travellers from China are being allowed into South Korea. They must test negative before departure and also on arrival.\n\nOne Chinese man who tested positive escaped from a bus taking him to a quarantine hotel near the airport. Two days later he was caught by police in a hotel in Seoul.",

Physical sales came down but revenue from streaming sties like Spotify and Apple Music have gone up, earning the industry nearly \u00a32bn.\n\nERA CEO Kim Bayley claimed \"music is within sight of exceeding \u00a32bn in retail sales value for the first time in more than two decades\".\n\nThe full report will be released in March.",

Business Secretary Grant Shapps: \"We are duty-bound to protect the lives... of the British people\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Grant Shapps has set out plans to enforce minimum service levels during strike action, including for ambulance staff, firefighters and railway workers.\n\nUnder the bill, some employees would be required to work during a strike and could be sacked if they refuse.\n\nMr Shapps said the aim was to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nBut unions said the proposed bill was \"undemocratic, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal\".\n\nAnd Labour said it would repeal the legislation if it wins the next general election.\n\nThe new bill, published on Tuesday, comes amid a wave of industrial action across public services, with unions calling for pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living.\n\nBut it is not set to become law until later this year - provided it gets past opposition in the House of Lords - so will have no impact on the current strikes.\n\nThe government is seeking to extend legislation on public transport already making its way through Parliament to cover other sectors.\n\nMinisters will get the power to set minimum safety levels for fire, ambulance and rail services under the bill, which will apply to England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nThey would also have the power to set minimum levels of service for health, education, nuclear decommissioning and border security but hope to reach voluntary agreements in these areas.\n\nMinisters will decide the level of service required for each sector during strikes following a consultation.\n\nEmployers will then be able to issue a \"work notice\" to unions, setting out who is required to work during a strike.\n\nUnder the legislation there would be no automatic protection from unfair dismissal for an employee who is told to work through a notice but chooses to strike.\n\nIf a strike is not conducted in accordance with the new rules, employers would be also be able to sue unions for losses.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it was \"utterly stupid\" and \"insulting\" for Mr Shapps to go from thanking nurses to proposing to sack them for striking.\n\n\"We all want minimum standards of safety, service and staffing. It is the ministers failing to provide it,\" she said, adding that the public was being put at risk every day by the crisis in the NHS and staff shortages.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Angela Rayner asks Grant Shapps about strikes in the public sector: \"Any chance of a deal this year?\"\n\nMr Shapps told MPs: \"No one is talking about sacking nurses... nothing we are announcing today in this bill from the despatch box is about getting rid of nurses any more than any employment contract has to be followed.\"\n\nHe added that the government \"absolutely believes in the right to strike\" but it is \"duty bound\" to protect the lives and livelihoods of the public.\n\n\"We don't want to use this legislation but we must ensure the safety of the British public,\" he said.\n\nMr Shapps said the proposed legislation was similar to existing laws in Spain and France - and it would not break European human rights laws.\n\nConservative MPs spoke in support of the plans in the Commons but one, Stephen McPartland, said on Twitter it was \"shameful\" to target individual workers and \"order them to walk past their mates on [the] picket line or be sacked\".\n\nThe head of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Paul Nowak, said that if it became law the legislation would \"prolong disputes and poison industrial relations - leading to more frequent strikes\".\n\n\"This legislation would mean that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don't comply,\" he said.\n\n\"That's undemocratic, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal.\"\n\nThe TUC said it would hold a national \"protect the right to strike\" day on 1 February in protest against the bill.\n\nFire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack called the bill a \"shameful attack\" on democratic rights and key workers.\n\nMick Lynch, head of the RMT transport union, said the \"draconian legislation\" sought to \"punish workers\" for demanding decent pay and working conditions.\n\nThe GMB union, which represents some ambulance workers, said the bill would \"alienate\" NHS staff further by \"attacking their fundamental right to take action\".\n\nAmbulance staff in England and Wales are preparing to walk out on Wednesday, while nurses in England and teachers in Scotland are also set to strike next week.\n\nAre you taking part in the strikes?

            "content": "Leisure services at risk without further support for energy bills, UK government warned Last updated on .From the section Sport\n\nUKactive believes leisure services should be classes as 'intensive' energy users requiring more bespoke support Swimming pools, leisure centres and gyms are at risk of closure unless the UK government offers more support to tackle soaring energy costs, a fitness industry trade body has warned. The government is scaling back its energy support scheme from April to focus on heavy energy-using sectors. That currently does not include the leisure sector, something UKactive said was a \"significant oversight\". It warned of \"severe\" effects on the industry unless the scheme is reviewed. \"Communities will see the loss of local services - including swimming lessons for children, mental health services, bespoke programmes for older citizens, ethnically diverse communities and disabled people - and long-term health programmes including cancer rehabilitation, musculoskeletal support and type 2 diabetes,\" said UKactive chief executive Huw Edwards. \"This will impact millions of people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. \"Tragically, the impact of the scheme and more facility closures will damage further our national health, our NHS and our economic growth.\" UKactive warned that even under the current energy relief scheme 74% of council areas are already classified as \"unsecure\", meaning there is risk of the closure of leisure centres or reduced services before March 2024. The scheme is mainly used by businesses, but is also for charities and public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals. The government first launched the package last September after prices were driven up in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Wholesale gas prices are now below the level they were before Russia's invasion, but still three to four times higher than their long-term average. In its announcement, the government said it was scaling back the energy subsidies for the next financial year to \u00a35.5bn, warning that the current level of help was too expensive. Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said: \"This decision by the government to not provide additional support to swimming pools and leisure centres is a hammer blow and flies in the face of previous statements from the government about the importance of physical activity and reducing pressures on the NHS. \"The government must review this decision immediately. \"With bills routinely tripling in price and energy costs typically being the second highest expense for swimming pool owners and operators, they have been consistently warning that without support pools and leisure centres will have to close. \"Sadly, we have already seen a number shutting in recent weeks and in light of [this] decision we will likely only see more and more pools disappearing across all parts of the country - each one a devastating loss for the local community.\" Councillor David Renard, energy spokesman for the Local Government Association, said that while it is \"good\" the government will continue to help the public sector, the LGA remain \"deeply concerned about the risk to some council services\". He added: \"Libraries and museums will be eligible for extra support, as energy-intensive industries, but leisure centres and swimming pools will not be equally protected from high energy prices. \"These valuable public facilities are at risk of reduced hours or even closure due to unsustainable and increasing costs. \"If the government is serious about reducing pressure on the NHS, as well as meeting its other targets on physical activity and sports participation, it must continue to support our leisure centres and public swimming pools which help people stay active, healthy and out of hospital. \"Councils need support with their energy bills for all their local services, so they can stay open and provide a safe haven for residents during this unprecedented cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\u2022 None Can they identify The Traitors to win \u00a3120,000?",

The world of cancer changes. So I think it would be more appropriate and probably more poignant and relevant to get people that are going through it now.\"\n\nSteve said there would not be many more episodes from them and it would be a \"long goodbye\".\n\nJames co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Rachael Bland (left) and Lauren Mahon (centre)\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"We'd like the podcast to carry on because it's a really important thing for so many people.\n\n\"It just takes a toll and it's heavy and it's hard to kind of keep talking about this stuff - particularly when we've had to deal with obviously Rachel and Deborah over the last few years.\n\n\"There aren't many people doing podcasts where two people have died from the subject matter. It's a tough thing to keep talking about.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as the pair announced they will record an episode with a live audience later this month.

I was the shadow, the supporting actor, the plan B,\" he writes, in a translation of the book's Spanish edition.\n\n\"I was brought into this world in case something happened to Willy,\" he writes, using the nicknames that saw Prince William as \"Willy\" and Prince Harry as \"Harold\".\n\nThe saying \"an heir and a spare\" refers to aristocratic families needing an heir to inherit a title or an estate, and the \"spare\" as the younger sibling who could be the replacement if anything happened to the heir before he or she has their own children.\n\nIt clearly annoyed Prince Harry enough to use it as a title for his book, and it taps into the longstanding difficulty of this uncertain royal understudy role, where there's wealth and privilege but no obvious sense of purpose.\n\n\"It's a non-position,\" says royal expert Professor Pauline Maclaran, from the Centre for the Study of Modern Monarchy, Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\n\"There's no clear role apart from shaking hands and being pleasant to people,\" says Prof Maclaran.\n\nA life of pointless luxury might have its decadent charms, but it also carries a heavy risk of unfulfillment and lack of direction.\n\nSo much so that Prof Maclaran says that a modern, slimmed-down monarchy should either find better defined roles for such individuals, or else release them from any royal expectations, once they've slipped down the pecking order of succession.\n\nRoyal historian Ed Owens says Sweden and Denmark are examples of where such an approach has been taken, \"downsizing\" the royal families, so that individuals who might have been marginal \"spares\" can have their own private lives \"unfettered by royal responsibilities\".\n\nPrincess Margaret with her elder sister Queen Elizabeth II at the Badminton Horse Trials, 1973\n\nMr Owens says that Princess Margaret, younger sister to the late Queen Elizabeth II, is an example of the pressures put upon such siblings, in a way that remains relevant to the problems raised by Prince Harry.\n\nHe says Princess Margaret faced having her private life \"taken apart\" by the media - something that he says would be much less likely to happen to the monarch or those directly in line of succession.\n\nFor the second child, with no role expected beyond dutifully \"playing second fiddle\", it means facing tougher and more \"mischievous headlines\", with less expectation of protection from scrutiny, says the historian.\n\n\"More marginal royals are seen as fair game. The dignity accorded those in direct line is not afforded to those younger royals,\" he says.\n\nThis echoes Prince Harry's description of the spare as a \"back-up, distraction, diversion\".\n\nPrince Andrew looks at messages and floral tributes for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, September 2022\n\nPrince Andrew is another whose attempts at finding a role have not exactly ended well. Even before the scandal involving sex assault claims, which he denied, he had gained the nickname of Air Miles Andy for his many overseas trips.\n\nBut there have been positive outcomes. George VI, a shy and initially reluctant monarch, had been Edward VIII's younger sibling but stepped up to the plate as King after his childless brother abdicated, and proved to be a leader in wartime.\n\nHis father, George V, had been another second son who came to the throne. His older brother had died at the age of 28 in an outbreak of flu in 1892.\n\nApart from the hereditary principle that puts the \"spare\" into second place, Prof Maclaran suggests looking at it through the prism of family dynamics.\n\nShe says they can have \"second-child syndrome\", rebellious and resentful of the older child who has been given more status and responsibility.\n\nThis can create its own sibling tension, Prof Maclaran argues, with the older child also getting irritated by the lack of responsibility shown by the younger. It's a psychological tinder box as well as a constitutional fixture.\n\nThere are also historical templates for the younger royal being cast in a negative light, accused of dissolute and disreputable behaviour or as a rival threatening to undermine the authority of the elder.\n\nThink of Bad King John versus Good King Richard, in the 12th Century power struggle between brothers, that was depicted in a 1970s Disney movie.\n\nPrincess Margaret with Diana Princess of Wales, and princes William and Harry, after the Trooping the Colour ceremony in June 1988\n\nBut in the 21st Century there's no need for any restrictions or negativity towards \"spare\" royals, says author and historian Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\nHe says that Prince Harry and Meghan have great potential to do good and could have a \"massive future, rather than be spent forces,\" for the monarchy if \"wisdom and generosity prevails\".\n\n\"Someone has to be the grown-up here. You have two very understandably damaged brothers and this will drag on and on and start causing serious damage.\n\n\"It is still recoverable, but there has to be an accommodation between the brothers.\n\n\"No-one is winning from the current war,\" warns Sir Anthony.",

At times, the atmosphere has felt tense, our correspondent adds.\n\nThe new president - widely known as Lula - and the heads of Congress and the Supreme Court said they \"reject the terrorist acts and criminal, coup-mongering vandalism that occurred\" during Sunday's riots.\n\nThe dramatic scenes saw thousands of protesters clad in yellow Brazil football shirts and flags overrun police and ransack the heart of the Brazilian state.\n\nOn Monday morning, heavily armed officers started dismantling a camp of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters in Bras\u00edlia - one of a number that have been set up outside army barracks around the country since the presidential election.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Ros Atkins on... Why the Brazil riots happened\n\nAuthorities arrested 1,200 people on Monday - in addition to 300 detained a day earlier.\n\nJustice Minister Flavio Dino said some 40 buses which had been used to transport protesters to the capital had been seized.\n\nThe scale of the damage was still starkly evident on Monday afternoon, even as officials lauded the progress of the clean-up at the presidential palace, reports the BBC's Bernd Debusmann in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nHe says workers were cleaning up broken glass around the building's exterior. Almost every window on the building's ground floor had been damaged, forcing crews to painstakingly remove each pane of glass and replace it with a new one.\n\nThe cobblestone pavement outside the palace also showed signs of damage, with large patches torn out by rioters on Sunday.\n\n\"They were using the rocks as missiles,\" one official said. \"To break the glass.\"\n\nIn the nearby Congress building, the damage included valuable works of art, including several high-profile pieces that were reportedly damaged by water or defaced during the riot.\n\nThe streets, however, were largely calm and devoid of noticeable military or police presence, our correspondent adds.\n\nMr Bolsonaro condemned the attack and denied responsibility for encouraging the rioters in a post on Twitter some six hours after violence broke out.\n\nMeanwhile, Bras\u00edlia Governor Ibaneis Rocha has been removed from his post for 90 days by the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Minister Alexandre de Moraes accused him of failing to prevent the riot and of being \"painfully silent\" in the face of the attack. Mr Rocha has apologised for Sunday's events.\n\nVideo shared by the Brazilian outlet O Globo showed some officers laughing and taking photos together as demonstrators occupied the congressional campus in the background.\n\nDemonstrators were quick to defend their actions when approached by reporters.\n\nLima, a 27-year-old production engineer, said: \"We need to re-establish order after this fraudulent election.\"\n\n\"I'm here for history, for my daughters,\" she told AFP news agency.\n\nOthers in the capital expressed outrage at the violence and said the attack marked a sad day for the country.\n\n\"I voted for Bolsonaro but I don't agree with what they're doing,\" Daniel Lacerda, 21, told the BBC. \"If you don't agree with the president you should just say it and move on, you shouldn't go hold protests and commit all the violence like they're doing.\"\n\nBolsonaro supporters created camps in cities across Brazil, some of them outside the military barracks. That is because his most ardent supporters want the military to intervene and make good elections that they say were stolen.\n\nIt looked like their movement had been curbed by Lula's inauguration - the camps in Bras\u00edlia had been dismantled and there was no disruption on the day he was sworn in.\n\nBut Sunday's scenes show that those predictions were premature.\n\nSome protesters are not just angry that Bolsonaro lost the election - they want President Lula to return to prison.\n\nHe spent 18 months in jail after being found guilty of corruption in 2017. His convictions were later annulled, after initially being sentenced to more than nine years.\n\nHeads of state around the world have also denounced the violence, with the leaders of the US, Canada and Mexico issuing a joint statement on Monday condemning \"attacks on Brazil's democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power\".\n\nLate on Monday, President Joe Biden \"conveyed the unwavering support of the United States for Brazil's democracy\" during a phone call with Lula, the White House said in a statement. It added that the Brazilian leader had accepted Mr Biden's invitation to visit Washington in early February.\n\nComparisons have been drawn with the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by supporters of Donald Trump, an ally of Mr Bolsonaro. Mr Biden was sworn in that day after defeating Mr Trump in presidential elections the previous November.",

Later, he said he realised \u00a398,000 had been transferred from his bank accounts.\n\nMost recently, a man claimed to have blacked out when he visited the club in November. When he checked his account, he saw that \u00a316,000 had been sent to a number of other accounts he did not recognise.\n\nHe said he remembered drinking, dancing and being led to a separate area, but said he had no other memories until he woke up in a street near his home the next day.\n\nTracing his movements with Google Maps, the man said the app showed he had spent two hours at a car wash before being dropped off near his home.\n\nA police report read: \"The victim does not know how he arrived at these locations or how he has returned home.\"\n\nAt a council licensing committee meeting on Monday, Vanity Soho's lawyer Gary Grant said men who visited the venue had come up with excuses to make to their loved ones.\n\n\"There are instances of when the wives, girlfriends and partners have found out because they've been pinged by their bank about what's going on,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not uncommon during allegations for those men to say: 'I'm sorry it wasn't me, I must have had my drink spiked and that explains why I spent our summer holiday money on strippers.'\"\n\nThe strip club has argued the spikings could have happened at brothels rather than at the venue.\n\nThe Met's lawyer said Vanity had a \"heavy burden\" for letting people leave the premises in a vulnerable position, regardless of whether they had been spiked.\n\nFollowing the seven-hour meeting, Westminster City Council suspended the venue's licence for three months and banned the bar's managers from working there.\n\nThe council also added 23 conditions to the strip club's licence including staff having to be retrained.\n\nFollow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

His supporters took on his narrative wholeheartedly.\n\nSince he lost the elections in October, Mr Bolsonaro has gone very quiet. He has not publicly conceded defeat - he flew off to Florida to avoid having to hand over the presidential sash to Lula - and he's allowed his most ardent supporters to remain angry over a democratic election that he legitimately lost.\n\nLast week, his former vice president said the silence of leaders sowed chaos in society - and that is what Jair Bolsonaro is guilty of, at the very least.\n\nOne Bolsonaro supporter shields another in Brasilia on Sunday\n\nTension has definitely been building these past few months. Camps were set up across the country in front of army headquarters, with protesters loyal to Mr Bolsonaro calling for military intervention.\n\nAnd then in December, supporters set fire to Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia. Another supporter was arrested for allegedly trying to set off a bomb before Lula's inauguration on 1 January.\n\nBrazilians feared what happened on Sunday was only a matter of time. Perhaps more worrying is the role the authorities played in allowing this to happen.\n\nIt's no secret that many security forces are more on the side of Mr Bolsonaro than Lula. Mr Bolsonaro's narrative throughout his term about security in Brazil - and keeping people safe - made sure he had allies within the police and the armed forces.\n\nBrasilia's governor, Ibaneis Rocha - a long-time ally of Jair Bolsonaro - has been suspended for 90 days. The Security Secretary of Brasilia, Anderson Torres, was also dismissed over yesterday's events.\n\nTo what point, then, were authorities working with protesters to allow such an invasion of top-security government buildings?\n\nAnd pressure is building outside Brazil too - with Mr Bolsonaro still in Florida, Joe Biden has already been asked to extradite the former Brazilian president to face questions back home.\n\nWhile Lula's administration tries to get to the bottom of where it all went wrong, the challenge remains - he has formidable opposition in these protesters, so could this happen again?\n\nWhile much has been said about the protesters' anger over Mr Bolsonaro's loss in October, this is more about the man he lost to - Lula.\n\nFor them, the current president - who was jailed in 2017 for corruption, and spent 18 months in prison before the convictions were annulled - is a corrupt politician who belongs in prison, not the presidential palace.\n\nThey falsely accuse him of being a communist, wanting to impose a regime like Venezuela or Cuba. They won't be convinced by anything else - and they won't give up their fight for \"democracy\" as they call it.\n\nBut there's a massive flaw in their argument in wanting freedom and democracy.\n\nThey are calling for a very undemocratic military intervention to \"save\" Brazil - an intervention that despite their best efforts, doesn't look forthcoming.",

It will apply in England, Scotland and Wales - but not in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is likely to face significant opposition in the House of Lords, as only transport strikes were mentioned in the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto pledge to introduce minimum service levels.\n\nThe Times newspaper quoted a government source saying striking workers who defied minimum service rules could face dismissal for breach of contract.\n\nBut a business department source told the BBC it was \"not our intention to penalise individuals\".\n\nUnder existing laws, people who take illegal strike action can already be sacked.\n\nThe business department also called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the current disputes \"constructively through dialogue\".\n\nIt said it would invite unions to meet for \"honest, constructive conversations\" about what was \"fair and affordable\" in public sector pay settlements for 2023/24.\n\nBut a number of unions have cast doubt on their continued involvement in the independent pay review process.\n\nGary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: \"There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers' actions have consistently undermined its independence. The process needs real reform.\"\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner described the minimum-service proposals as \"unworkable and unserious from a dead-end government\".\n\n\"At every stage the government has sought to collapse talks and throw in last minute spanners.

For the other sectors, the government says it expects to be able to reach voluntary agreements.\n\nA wave of industrial action is affecting sectors from the health and postal services to driving examinations, as people seek pay rises that keep up with the fast-rising cost of living.\n\nRail workers in the RMT and other unions have taken part in a series of large-scale strikes over more than six months, with Thursday marking the sixth day of action since last summer by members of Aslef, which represents most train drivers.\n\nTUC general secretary Paul Nowak condemned the proposed bill as \"wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal\".\n\n\"This is an attack on the right to strike. It's an attack on working people, and it's an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties.\n\n\"This government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services,\" he added.\n\nRoyal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen said: \"Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances.\n\n\"We've long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients... Today's highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say 'enough is enough'.\"\n\nEarlier, Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said he did not think new legislation would make life harder for his union.\n\nHe suggested it would lead to unions having to organise more strikes locally, instead of nationally.\n\nMr Whelan said: \"There have been minimum [service] levels in European countries for several years. They have never been enacted because they don't work.\"\n\nHe added that employers could already sack workers, if they went on strike for more than six weeks.\n\nMatt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said the UK already had some of the most restrictive anti-union laws in the western world.\n\nHe accused the Conservatives of being \"clearly hellbent on criminalising and victimising trade unions with this threatened onslaught on the right to strike\".\n\n\"The Tories are badly misjudging the public mood with these attacks on the pay and conditions of key workers, who kept Britain going during the pandemic,\" he added.",

I think it will get fixed.\n\n\"This is the start of a much longer commercial spaceflight journey that the UK is only just starting to make\"\n\nCrowds that had gathered on Monday night at Spaceport Cornwall, from where the jumbo jet took off, were deeply disappointed.\n\n\"Any kind of failure, it's how you react to it, so for us it's to get right back up again,\" said Melissa Thorpe, who heads the spaceport. \"We're here to support and get Virgin back up and get another rocket over here in the near future, hopefully, and just keep going.\"\n\nIt's clear that Spaceport Cornwall has tried to create a business model that is not solely reliant on Virgin Orbit.\n\nIt wants to be a focus for a cluster of space companies, and so far this seems to be working. Its new office centre is over-subscribed. And, of course, the spaceport is just one part of the larger Newquay Airport complex.\n\nJosh Western, CEO of Space Forge, an aerospace company headquartered in Cardiff that lost one of its satellites in the failed launch, told BBC News that he would be prepared to launch from Spaceport Cornwall again with Virgin Orbit.\n\n\"We didn't get to orbit but to see that plane take off with a rocket strapped under its wing, from a very blustery part of Cornwall and ignite that first stage and almost make it\u2026 it's really quite profound that we achieved so much in so little time,\" he said.\n\nMr Western said the trip was meant to test a new way of returning satellites from space to Earth, bringing them back gently enough that the company could for the first time ever re-use and re-launch satellites.\n\nHe said the satellite was insured and that the main loss to the start-up company had been in terms of time spent on the project rather than money.\n\nThe establishment of the spaceport and the mission have cost roughly \u00a320m. That includes money from local government in Cornwall and national funding through the UK Space Agency.\n\nShares in Virgin Orbit fell more than 20% in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the failed launch.\n\nThe rocket ignited and appeared to be ascending correctly. But word then came from the company that the rocket had suffered its anomaly.\n\nWe'll have to wait for the official investigation but it's already apparent the Virgin Orbit rocket ran in to trouble during the engine burn on its upper-stage.\n\nThe LauncherOne rocket is a two-stage vehicle, meaning it has two propulsive sections, one that should fire for about three minutes and then fall away, and a second one that should fire for roughly six minutes. A further manoeuvre on the second stage would ordinarily be required to fine-tune the orbit before the satellites are set free to circle the Earth.\n\nThe six-minute burn on the upper-stage looks to have been completed, but by its end the rocket was not at the altitude it should have been and seemed to be falling fast. When the data stream eventually froze on Virgin Orbit's webcast, the vehicle was described as being at only 75km (245,000ft) in altitude.\n\nIt's difficult to judge much on a webcast. The data jumps around a lot as telemetry drops out when the rocket finishes talking to one ground station without yet picking up the next communication point. But Virgin Orbit should have a mass of data to go through to enable engineers to find the cause of the anomaly and to fix it.\n\nTickets for the launch event were snapped up. There was great enthusiasm from the crowd\n\nThe 747 jumbo that carried the rocket to its launch altitude returned to Newquay Airport safely and stands ready to be used on future missions already booked with Virgin Orbit.\n\nThe company only managed two flights last year and has a backlog of customers it needs to get into space. It will be looking for a swift return to flight. The Virgin Orbit factory in Long Beach, California, has rockets being produced on a production line.\n\nAll the rocket hardware from Monday's flight - or at least any debris from the mission - is likely now sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The southward trajectory of the rocket was carefully chosen so that populated areas were avoided in the event of a failure. Warnings were also issued in advance to aircraft and ships to stay clear of obvious danger zones.\n\nThe first stage and the rocket fairing - the nosecone that protects the satellites through the thick, lower-reaches of the atmosphere - would have come down off the coast of Portugal as planned anyway. The faulty second stage and those nine small satellites probably returned to Earth somewhere off the coast of Africa.\n\nA Virgin Orbit mission costs in excess of $10m to purchase. This one was bought by the US National Reconnaissance Office and based in the UK so that the American and British governments could fly satellites containing technologies of future interest in the realms of defence and security.\n\nThese included advanced radios to track illegal fishers and smugglers at sea. The satellite manufacturers and operators would obviously also have sunk considerable investment into their missions. A number of the payloads were said to be insured, however.\n\nVirgin Orbit is a young company trying to establish itself in the highly competitive launch market.\n\nCustomers are acutely sensitive to the price of a launch but even more so to the reliability of the vehicle performing that launch. Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne rocket has now flown six times with two failures.\n\nThat's not unusual in an immature system, but when so many new rockets are coming into the market, a track record of successful launches is what stands out in the crowd. And being a young company, Virgin Orbit is in that growing phase where it's not currently making money. Quite the opposite. There's an urgency to get back flying successfully and regularly.",

At one point, pretty much every available detective in South Wales Police was involved and engaged in this enquiry, along with all of our forensic capability,\" said Det Supt Mark O'Shea.\n\n\"It was the biggest forensic case that we've ever run in this force area, with links across the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe case involved organised crime groups from south-east England and Europe, with Welsh officers paying tribute to Albanian police in particular.\n\nThe court heard Aliaj was a fireman in Albania and played a significant role in a rescue operation following an earthquake in the country, receiving an award for bravery.\n\nMr Waga and another man, Carl Davies, travelled from east London to try to steal cannabis plants from a house in Newport Road, Cardiff.\n\nThe court heard Mr Waga had a previous conviction on his record for carrying out a similar crime.\n\nUpon breaking into the three-storey property - a former GP surgery on Newport Road, Cardiff, they discovered Aliaj, the gang's \"gardener\", asleep in one of the rooms.\n\nThe court heard the house contained 572 cannabis plants with an estimated yield of between 16kg and 48kg (35lb and 105lb) and a potential value of between \u00a364,000 and nearly \u00a3250,000\n\nBut after having heard the burglars, Aliaj alerted other members, including Nushi and Dhana, who managed to get to the house within five minutes.\n\nMr Waga and Mr Davies, who had remained in the house to collect cannabis plants, tried to flee from an upstairs window but were cornered by the three defendants.\n\nThe pair were then attacked with baseball bats and bricks and Mr Waga was dragged into a Mercedes car.\n\nHis body was later found dumped in the Penylan area of Cardiff.\n\nHe suffered 25 injuries to his head and mouth, bruising to his chest and damage to his ribs, arms and a degree of swelling and bruising to his brain.\n\nHis cause of death was given as obstruction to the airways by blood.\n\nTomasz Waga and another man, Carl Davies, travelled from east London to try to steal cannabis plants from a house in Newport Road, Cardiff\n\nA statement from Tomosz Waga's sister was read to the court.\n\nShe said her mother, father and Mr Waga's partner had tried to complete statements but could not because they were too upset.\n\n\"I wouldn't wish this kind of trauma on anyone, no matter what,\" she said.\n\n\"I have been living in survival mode since and the pain of not being there to comfort him in his last moments of life as his older sister has been unimaginable.\"\n\nTomasz Waga travelled to Cardiff from Dagenham on the day he was killed\n\nMs Waga described the way her brother's body was disposed of as \"inhumane\".\n\n\"The way in which he was dumped like a bag of rubbish will haunt me for the rest of my life, as will seeing his lifeless and battered face during formal identification,\" she said.\n\n\"He was robbed of witnessing his son's countless precious moments and milestones, including taking his first steps or saying dad.\n\n\"It truly breaks my heart seeing him growing up without my brother present.\n\n\"He was my only brother, and despite the bad choices that he made on the night, he had a good heart, meant well.

Police say there was no threat to the public.\n\nIt was found in a shipment of scrap metal, a source said.\n\nA Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson told BBC News that the reports were \"not factual\", adding that no information to this effect had been shared with Pakistan officially.\n\nA former commander of the UK's defence forces said \"a very small sample\" was found and offered assurances that \"there are people looking out for this 24 hours a day\".\n\nColonel Hamish De Bretton-Gordon said the incident \"should not worry the public\".\n\nHowever, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, in light of recent nuclear threats, he could see why the public was concerned.\n\nHe said uranium could potentially be used for nuclear fuel in power stations and, when highly enriched, it could be used for nuclear weapons.\n\nAlarms were triggered at Heathrow after specialist scanners detected the substance as it was ferried to a freight shed owned by handling firm Swissport, the Sun said.\n\nThe shipment's intended destination is not clear. No-one has been arrested.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"We can confirm officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command were contacted by Border Force colleagues at Heathrow after a very small amount of contaminated material was identified after routine screening within a package incoming to the UK.\"\n\nCommander Richard Smith from the force's counter terrorism team separately told the BBC: \"Although our investigation remains ongoing, from our inquiries so far, it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat.\n\n\"As the public would expect, however, we will continue to follow up on all available lines of inquiry to ensure this is definitely the case.\"\n\nStrict protocols must be followed in order to fly dangerous cargo, including uranium, being loaded onto the base of units in the cargo hold and ensuring a minimum distance is kept between the nuclear material and cabin above.\n\nUranium is an element which occurs naturally. It can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by the use of centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds.\n\nLow-enriched uranium can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.\n\nHighly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more.\n\nCabinet minister Steve Barclay said he hoped for more information in \"due course\" and it was right an investigation \"looks at all the issues\".\n\n\"I'm learning about this this morning,\" he told Sky News.\n\nThe Home Office said: \"We do not comment on live investigations.\"\n\u2022 None The element that causes arguments",

            "section": "China",
            "content": "Jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai's international legal team have asked UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for an urgent meeting ahead of his trial on national security charges later this year.\n\nThe trial on charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition could see Mr Lai - who holds British nationality - spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nIn the letter, seen by the BBC, Mr Lai's international legal team say they want to discuss \"potential ways to secure Mr Lai's release\".\n\nThe lawyers describe the case against him as \"deeply concerning\" and \"emblematic\".\n\nJimmy Lai has already been in detention for two years, facing numerous charges. In December he was sentenced to an additional five years and nine months for breaking a lease agreement at the newspaper's headquarters.\n\nHis supporters say all the charges against him are politically motivated.\n\nMr Lai founded pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily. For more than 25 years his tabloid was seen as the only opposition newspaper in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, the newspaper was forced to close in June 2021 when its accounts were frozen and a number of senior staff were arrested under Hong Kong's national security law.\n\nBeijing imposed the wide-ranging national security law on the former British colony in 2020.\n\nThe authorities say it was needed to restore order after a year of often violent protests. Critics say it is being used to silence political opponents of Beijing via the practice of \"lawfare\" - the use of the legal system as a political weapon.\n\nToday the majority of the political opposition are either in prison or have fled the territory.\n\nMr Lai has long been considered the top target of the new legislation and his UK-based legal team has requested meetings with two consecutive foreign ministers, the first of which they say was rejected while the second went unanswered.\n\nEarlier this month the UK government agreed for the team to meet a minister from the foreign office, the letter says.\n\nIn the letter, Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC also highlighted that the US government had condemned Mr Lai's conviction in October on fraud charges but the UK government had made no formal statement.\n\nThe British government confirmed that a junior foreign office minister had met Mr Lai's UK-based legal team on Tuesday.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesperson said: \"We've been clear the Hong Kong authorities must end their targeting of pro-democracy voices, including Jimmy Lai.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Lai's son Sebastien told the BBC his father should not be behind bars.\n\n\"This is a man who for 20-odd years has given up a lot for democracy in Hong Kong which was something that was actually promised when the British handed Hong Kong back to China,\" he said.\n\nLike his father, Sebastien is a British citizen. He lives in self-imposed exile in Taiwan. Since the arrest of his father under the national security law, he is unsure if he can return home.\n\n\"He is a British citizen who is in jail for championing these values we all take for granted that are sacrosanct to all of us,\" the 28-year-old said of his father.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has tried to block Timothy Owen KC from representing Mr Lai\n\nHong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called \"one country, two systems\" principle.\n\nThey are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.\n\nHowever, the national security law makes it easier to prosecute protesters and critics say it has reduced the city's autonomy.\n\nMr Lai's trial has been adjourned to September 2023 with a ruling over who is allowed to represent him pending.\n\nHe had wanted British human rights lawyer Timothy Owen KC to represent him - but the Hong Kong government opposed this and the central Chinese government in Beijing has since ruled that Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee has the power to bar foreign lawyers from national security trials. However no final decision has yet been made.\n\n\"Lai's case is a test case for fair trials and free speech,\" said Eric Lai, a Hong Kong legal scholar.\n\nThe authorities have described the seriousness of his alleged crimes - colluding with foreign forces and sedition - as comparable to murder.\n\n\"Jimmy Lai is a traitor who is manipulated by foreign forces and sells his country for prosperity,\" Johnny Patriotic, a self-styled pro-Beijing activist who is frequently outside court during Mr Lai's appearances, told the BBC.\n\nSebastien Lai however said his father had not committed any crime.\n\n\"The crime is that he is in jail for this. The crime is ignoring it and not speaking out,\" he said.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.

The 2021 European Parliament report pointed out that Sarah Mardini's first rescue had taken place in 2015 when she and her sister Yusra helped save others on board the boat they were travelling on.\n\nYusra Mardini went on to take part in the Rio Olympics as part of a refugee team and their story featured in the 2022 Netflix drama The Swimmers.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nTheir escape came at the height of the influx of migrants and refugees into Greece which prompted an EU deal with Turkey to close off the sea crossing. Greece has also denied allegations in recent years that it has forcibly sent dinghies back to Turkey in so-called pushbacks.\n\nSarah Mardini told the BBC after her release in 2018 that her arrest had come as a shock as her group had wanted to help refugees with medical assistance, water and a blanket when they arrived in Greece.\n\nSe\u00e1n Binder said the accusations of espionage and using encrypted communications involved nothing more than messaging via WhatsApp and listening to maritime radio.\n\nOther members of the group include volunteer lifeguard Nasos Karakitsos and retired Dutch national Pieter Wittenberg, who told Amnesty International that he faced 20-25 years in jail if convicted for standing on the beach as onlookers.\n\nTheir trial comes hard on the heels of the case of a Somali migrant called Mohamed Abdi jailed for 142 years for people-smuggling after saving more than 30 lives. Abdi said he had guided the migrant dinghy to shore after it was abandoned by a Turkish trafficker in 2020.\n\nThe court in Mytilini ruled on Monday that his sentence should be commuted and ordered his release for time served in jail.\n\nDozens of NGOs have criticised the Lesbos trial, and a group of European Parliament members have signed a letter calling on the government in Athens to drop the case.\n\nThe trial opened on Tuesday and was adjourned until Friday.",

            "content": "The impact of Wednesday's ambulance strike in England and Wales is likely to be worse than that of the one before Christmas, NHS managers are warning.\n\nThousands of paramedics and support staff will walk out for the second time this winter, in the dispute over pay.\n\nNHS Providers said this strike would be harder to cope with, as the government raised fears over the lack of a national deal on emergency cover.\n\nBut union leaders said life-and-limb cover would be provided.\n\nBut there is no formal agreement of what that involves and so it has been left to local services to agree their own arrangements with the unions involved, the GMB and Unison.\n\nHow are you affected by the strike?\n\nYour device may not support this visualisation\n\nThe highest-category calls, for immediately life-threatening emergencies such as cardiac arrests, will be covered - but not every emergency in the next category down, which includes heart attacks and strokes, will be provided for.\n\nGovernment sources involved in contingency planning said the lack of agreement over emergency calls was a concern.\n\nThey said this could be covered by the minimum-service legislation ministers are considering introducing.\n\nBut union leaders said detailed plans were in place to ensure lives were not put at risk, including exemptions for some union members expected to work during the walkout.\n\nServices will also bring in other NHS staff, alongside the military, to provide support. London Ambulance Service has confirmed it aims to get to all heart attacks and strokes.\n\nUnison general secretary Christina McAnea said: \"Last time, staff didn't hesitate to leave picket lines when someone's life was in danger.\n\n\"After a decade of refusing to bring in minimum staffing levels, it's ironic that the government is only prepared to do so during a strike.\n\n\"Every other day of the year, ambulance crews are stuck queuing for hours outside A&E departments and hospital staff are rushed off their feet. But the government isn't interested in minimum staffing levels then.\"\n\nMiriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, said her members were worried because Unison was telling call handlers and ambulance dispatchers, who remained in work during the previous strike, to walk out also.\n\n\"With more staff expected to strike this time, the NHS is in an even more precarious position,\" she said.\n\n\"Since the last strikes, delays transferring patients from ambulances to hospitals have got worse, as pressure across the whole of the NHS increases.\n\n\"Trust leaders are working hard to minimise the impact on patients and to support staff during the industrial action - but they are braced for another day of significant disruption and knock-on effects.\"\n\nAlongside paramedics, 999 call centre workers will also going on strike. One ambulance dispatcher, who wishes to remain anonymous, says for them there is no other option.\n\n\"The job is crushingly depressing, stressful and embarrassing,\" the dispatcher says. \"I feel so destroyed. The feeling of saving lives has been taken over by how many can we not kill.\"\n\nThey say the most frustrating issue is the number of crews stuck outside hospital waiting to hand patients over to accident-and-emergency staff.\n\n\"I know going in that I will have to dispatch ambulance crews to hospitals to take over from other ambulance crews who have been outside for 12 hours,\" the dispatcher says.\n\n\"It just means we don't have those crews available to respond to calls and it exacerbates our shortness of resources by 10-fold, 100-fold.\n\n\"I never thought I'd leave the NHS - but I'd take a job at Aldi. I'd take a job cleaning. The thought of going in and having to manage those calls just fills me with absolute dread.\"\n\nSome of the walkouts will start from 00:01 but the duration and scale of the disruption will vary across different parts of England and Wales.\n\nOnly the East of England Ambulance Service will remain unaffected, as neither union obtained a strike mandate in the ballot there.\n\nBut Unison, the biggest union in the ambulance service, has a mandate for walkouts in only half of the 10 regional services in England.\n\nBetween them, the two unions represent about two-thirds of ambulance staff.\n\nDuring the last walkout, on 21 December, the service saw a lower number of calls than normal.\n\nNHS medical director for secondary care Dr Vin Diwakar said: \"The message from the NHS to patients is clear - if you need emergency care, please come forward.\n\n\"This means continuing to call 999 for life-threatening emergencies as well as using 111 online for other health needs, where you will receive clinical advice on the best next steps to take.\"\n\nThe walkout comes after ambulance staff along with other NHS workers were offered a pay rise averaging 4.75%. All were guaranteed an increase of at least \u00a31,400 a year - more than 7% for the lowest paid.\n\nUnions wanted an above-inflation pay rise, saying low pay was contributing to high vacancy rates and the problems the ambulance service was facing responding to emergency calls.\n\nIt is taking two to three times longer than it should to answer emergency calls such as for heart attacks and strokes.\n\nNHS unions met with Health Secretary Steve Barclay on Monday - but no agreement on pay was reached.\n\nAmbulance staff in Northern Ireland have also been on strike, while in Scotland the unions have a mandate for action but no dates have been set.\n\nOther NHS unions have also started striking or are planning to. Royal College of Nursing members will walk out on Wednesday and Thursday next week.\n\u2022 None Keep children off school if unwell with fever - advice",

He said a Labour government would instead let them return to claiming benefits within a year without a re-assessment.\n\nMr Ashworth also promised local councils control over a proportion of the skills budget currently spent by central government, to help ensure job training is better tailored to local areas.\n\nHe said his party would introduce greater flexibility to the government grants available to people with health conditions or disabilities to help them stay in work.\n\nThis, he said, would include allowing \"in-principle\" decisions to applicants so that employers have more certainty about what help is available.\n\nDuring the event, Mr Ashworth was asked if his party would stick by its 2019 manifesto pledge to replace the Universal Credit benefits system.\n\nThe shadow minister said Labour wanted to \"fundamentally reform\" the system and would consult on ways to simplifying the process.\n\nResponding to a preview of the speech, a spokesperson for the government said it was investing an extra \u00a322m in employment support for the over 50s.\n\nThey added that the Department for Work and Pensions was reviewing workforce participation to see what action could be taken to cut economic inactivity.",

            "content": "Ambulance staff will take part in their second day of strike action this winter, on Wednesday. Alongside paramedics, call-centre staff will walk out across England and Wales in the dispute over pay. These workers play a vital role, taking calls from the public and assigning ambulance crews.\n\nAn ambulance dispatcher at the North West Ambulance Service, who wishes to stay anonymous, has described working amid the extreme pressures of this winter.\n\n\"The job is crushingly depressing, stressful and embarrassing,\" the dispatcher says. \"I feel so destroyed. The feeling of saving lives has been taken over by how many can we not kill.\n\n\"I never thought I'd leave the NHS - but I'd take a job at Aldi. I'd take a job cleaning.\n\n\"The thought of going in and having to manage those calls just fills me with absolute dread. I have seen people leave the ambulance service - they have had enough. We are physically and mentally exhausted.\"\n\nMost frustrating, the dispatcher says, is the number of crews stuck outside hospital waiting to hand patients over to accident-and-emergency staff.\n\nIn the last week of 2022, more than 40% of crews in England had waits of more than 30 minutes - it should take 15.\n\n\"I know going in that I will have to dispatch ambulance crews to hospitals to take over from other ambulance crews who have been outside for 12 hours,\" the dispatcher says.\n\n\"It just means we don't have those crews available to respond to calls and it exacerbates our shortness of resources by 10-fold, 100-fold.\n\n\"So instead of going out on jobs, the first thing they do is go to the hospitals and free the ambulance staff up to go home. Those staff could have been there the whole shift virtually. This happens every shift at virtually every hospital.\n\nHow are your local NHS services coping this winter? Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.\n\n\"If the crews are with patients in ambulances, then we send one crew to one ambulance to swap. Effectively, if there's seven ambulances outside, then seven new pairs of crews complete with ambulances are swapping over. They then send the 12-hour old crew back to base to go home.\n\n\"It is not how things should be - and because we have so many ambulances stuck at hospital, we are putting patients at risk.\"\n\nThe problems are due to a lack of beds, the dispatcher says.\n\n\"Social care is not in place,\" they say. \"I'll give you an example - a lady had a fall and was medically fit for discharge on 21 December but because her care package wasn't in place, she was advised that it was safer if she stayed in hospital.\n\n\"That's a bed taken up for the entirety of the Christmas and new-year period by someone who is well enough to leave hospital.\"\n\nThe dispatcher is particularly concerned about category-two calls, which include people who have had strokes and heart attacks. Meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average, they are taking nearly three times as long and in some cases, they say, hours.\n\n\"We are now telling them how long they have to wait, when there are long waits,\" the dispatcher says. \"We are asking them if there is anyone who can convey them to [hospital], because time is of the essence. Sometimes, they don't have that - and three hours later, they can be dead.\n\n\"In one case, there was a man who had chest pains who drove himself to hospital and had a cardiac arrest in the hospital car park and crashed his car.\n\n\"This is not the NHS I know and love and is why we have to take action.\"\n\nIn response, the North West Ambulance Service said the service was under \"extreme pressure\" and some patients were waiting longer \"than we would like\".\n\nBut it added: \"Our staff work hard every day to ensure everyone who needs an ambulance gets one - and we continue to perform better than other parts of the country.\"\n\nThe service said it was working with other parts of the NHS to tackle handover delays and recruiting call handlers and clinicians into the call centres, as well as front-line ambulance crews.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said extra money it was investing this winter, totalling \u00a3750m, would help speed up delayed discharges, which in turn would ease the handover problems being seen.\n\n\"We recognise the pressures the NHS is facing following the impact of the pandemic and are working tireless to ensure people get the care they need,\" he added.\n\nDo you work for the ambulance service?

            "content": "Cardinal George Pell, whose conviction on child abuse charges shocked the Catholic Church before being quashed, has died at 81.\n\nThe former Vatican treasurer is Australia's highest ranking Catholic cleric, and the most senior Church figure ever jailed for such offences.\n\nHe died of heart complications after hip surgery, Church officials say.\n\nCardinal Pell served as Archbishop of both Melbourne and Sydney before becoming one of the Pope's top aides.\n\nHe was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official.\n\nBut the cleric left his post in 2017, returning to Australia to face trial on child sex abuse charges.\n\nA jury in 2018 found he had abused two boys while Archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s.\n\nCardinal Pell, who always maintained his innocence, spent 13 months in prison before the High Court of Australia quashed the verdict in 2020.\n\nHowever a civil lawsuit - launched by the father of a choirboy who prosecutors alleged Cardinal Pell abused - is still under way.\n\nMeanwhile a landmark inquiry found that he knew of child sexual abuse by priests in Australia as early as the 1970s but failed to take action.\n\nThe Child Abuse Royal Commission ran for several years, interviewing thousands of people, and its findings relating to Cardinal Pell were released after his acquittal. Cardinal Pell denied the allegation, insisting it was \"not supported by evidence\".\n\nArchbishop of Melbourne Peter Comensoli paid tribute to Cardinal Pell as \"a very significant and influential Church leader\" while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his death would be a \"shock to many\".\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott - a Catholic - praised the cleric as a \"saint for our times\" and \"an inspiration for the ages\", saying the charges he'd faced were \"a modern form of crucifixion\".\n\nBut Steve Dimopoulos - a government minister in Cardinal Pell's home state of Victoria - was among those who voiced mixed feelings.\n\n\"Today would be a very difficult day for the cardinal's family and loved ones, but also very difficult for survivors and victims of child sexual abuse and their families and my thoughts are with them,\" he said.\n\nThe cardinal was a polarising figure, both in Australia and abroad, something he himself conceded.\n\nHe rose to prominence in the Church as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2020, Cardinal Pell said there was \"no doubt\" that his \"direct\" style and traditional approach to issues such as abortion had driven parts of the public against him.\n\n\"The fact that I defend Christian teachings is irritating to a lot of people,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme.",

            "description": "It can improve life for thousands with type 1 diabetes in England and Wales, health assessors say.",
            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The technology reduces worry by automating the process of releasing insulin into the bloodstream\n\nMore than 100,000 people in England and Wales with type 1 diabetes could soon be offered new technology to manage their condition on the NHS.\n\nThe system uses a glucose sensor under the skin to automatically calculate how much insulin is delivered via a pump.\n\nHealth assessors said it was the best way of controlling diabetes, barring a cure.\n\nA charity said it would transform lives and was the \"closest thing to a working pancreas\".\n\nThe National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the health body recommending the technology, said a more cost-effective price still had to be agreed with manufacturers.\n\nIn trials, it improved quality of life and reduced the risk of long-term health complications.\n\nApproximately 400,000 people are currently living with type 1 diabetes in the UK, including around 29,000 children.\n\nTheir pancreas produces no, or very little, insulin - an important hormone which helps turn food into energy.\n\nSo they have to closely monitor levels of sugar, or glucose, in the blood and top up levels of insulin every day of their lives using injections or an insulin pump.\n\nThis new technology does that automatically, virtually mimicking the function of a pancreas - although it still requires information on food intake to work accurately.\n\n\"This technology has been proven to give the best control for managing type 1 diabetes and should make things like amputations, blindness, and kidney problems possibly a thing of the past,\" said Prof Partha Kar, national specialty adviser for diabetes at NHS England.\n\n\"The quality of life this technology gives to those using it is huge,\" he added.\n\nIt allows someone with type 1 diabetes to go about their daily life without stressing over whether their blood sugar is too high or too low, and therefore dangerous.\n\nYasmin Hopkins, 27, from London, had struggled to maintain her blood sugar levels since she was diagnosed at the age of 12.\n\nShe took part in trials of the new technology and told the BBC she found it liberating.\n\n\"I wake up now and I can do a normal day's work, or go on a dog walk without being concerned,\" she said.\n\nThe kit has been described as a step towards an artificial pancreas.\n\nUnder draft recommendations, NICE said the system should first be offered to patients in England and Wales unable to control their diabetes, including pregnant women, which could be around 100,000 people in England alone.\n\nAnyone can have their say on the guidance until Tuesday 31 January on the NICE website.\n\nNegotiations on a cost-effective price for the technology - called a closed hybrid loop system - are still to take place, however.\n\nThe technology currently costs nearly \u00a36,000 a year but NICE says it wants to agree a price for the NHS that \"is fair to taxpayers\".\n\nHilary Nathan, policy director at JDRF, the type 1 diabetes charity which has funded research into the system for many years, said it was \"a game-changing treatment at the forefront of health technology and artificial intelligence\".\n\nIf approved, she said, it would transform the lives of people living with type 1 in England and Wales, reduce deaths from glucose high and lows, and cut the risk of long-term health issues from the condition.\n\n\"It's the closest thing you can get to a working pancreas,\" she added.\n\nThe technology is already being rolled out in Scotland, where an additional \u00a314.6m is being spent on making sure people with type 1 diabetes can use it.\n\nThe system has been licensed for use by the UK regulator, the MHRA.\n\nType 1 diabetes is a different condition to type 2 diabetes, which is much more common. While both cause blood glucose levels to be higher than normal, type 1 is an auto-immune condition where the body attacks cells in the pancreas.\n\nIn people with type 2, the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and so more is needed to keep blood glucose levels within a normal range. It can usually be controlled through diet, exercise and close monitoring.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Prince Harry has ruled out a return to the UK as a working royal\n\nPrincess Diana would have been \"heartbroken\" about the conflict with his brother Prince William, Prince Harry has told a US television interview.\n\nHe told Good Morning America their mother would have been saddened at the arguments, which he said were fuelled by briefings to a divisive press.\n\nPrince Harry said there had to be \"accountability\" before reconciliation.\n\nHe also ruled out a return to the UK as a working royal.\n\nPrince Harry told ABC News TV interviewer Michael Strahan a return to such a life within the Royal Family in the UK would be \"unsurvivable\".\n\n\"That's really sad, because that's essentially breaking the relationship between us,\" said Prince Harry, in an interview about his memoir, Spare.\n\nIn the book Prince Harry speaks about the traumatic legacy of his mother's death in a car accident in 1997 - but says Diana would now be sad to see the dispute between her sons, with Prince Harry seeing William as his \"arch nemesis\" as well as \"beloved brother\" and describing a physical altercation between them.\n\n\"I think she would be looking at it long term to know that there are certain things that we need to go through to be able to heal the relationship,\" he said in the interview.\n\nHe also spoke about his relationship with Camilla, the Queen Consort, saying they hadn't spoken for a long time, but he didn't think of her as an \"evil stepmother\".\n\nPrince Harry said he had compassion for her as the \"third person within my parents' marriage\".\n\nIt was soon presented as \"Meghan versus Kate\", says Prince Harry about the sisters-in-law\n\n\"She had a reputation and an image to rehabilitate. And whatever conversations happened, whatever deals or trading was made right at the beginning, she was led to believe that would be the best way of doing it,\" he told the US news show.\n\nThese claims, presenting Prince Harry's view of events, have so far not drawn a response from Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace.\n\nIn an ITV interview on Sunday, Prince Harry had accused the Royal Family of failing to defend his wife Meghan - with overnight viewing figures showing it had been seen by an audience of 4.1 million viewers, behind Call the Midwife and Happy Valley which drew over 5 million that evening.\n\nPrince Harry highlighted the controversy over a Jeremy Clarkson newspaper column, saying the \"silence is deafening\" from the Royal Family about what he called the \"horrific\" Sun article.\n\nHe contrasted this with the quick action taken after a race row at a Buckingham Palace reception.\n\nThe Clarkson article about Meghan had described how the columnist was \"dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her\".\n\nLater taken down by the Sun and prompting an apology from the paper and Mr Clarkson, the article was described by Prince Harry as \"horrific and hurtful and cruel towards my wife\".\n\n\"The world is asking for some form of comment from the monarchy. But the silence is deafening. To put it mildly,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything to do with my wife, after six years, they haven't said a single thing.\n\nHe also said he believed that stereotyping about Meghan - as an \"American actress, divorced, biracial\" - had been a barrier to Prince William and Catherine \"welcoming her in\" to the family.\n\n\"Very quickly it became Meghan versus Kate,\" he said of how the relationship was presented in the media, also saying it was fair to say \"almost from the get-go\" that the sisters-in-law did not \"get on\".\n\nPrince Harry accused the Royal Family of \"getting into bed with the devil\" to improve its image - which he linked to relationships between \"certain members of the family and the tabloid press\".\n\nThe prince contrasted the lack of a royal response to the Clarkson article with the events that followed an encounter at Buckingham Palace between Lady Susan Hussey and Ngozi Fulani, just three weeks earlier.\n\nWhile attending an event, Ms Fulani - a black British charity founder - was challenged repeatedly by Lady Hussey about where she was \"really from\".\n\nThe controversy that followed produced a rapid apology.\n\nPrince Harry defended Lady Hussey, saying \"she had never meant any harm at all\". But he contrasted the reconciliatory meeting held between her and Ms Fulani at Buckingham Palace with the response to Prince Harry and Meghan's complaints.\n\nPrince Harry also gave an interview to Anderson Cooper for 60 Minutes on CBS News, which aired a few hours after ITV's show, and saw him speaking about Camilla, the Queen Consort, and her relationship with the media.\n\nCooper asked the duke about comments he made in his memoir suggesting that Camilla would be \"less dangerous\" if she was happy.\n\nPrince Harry said Camilla's need to \"rehabilitate her image\" and her \"willingness\" to forge relationships with the British press made her dangerous.\n\n\"And with a family built on hierarchy, and her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that.\"\n\nThe ITV interview had also returned to Prince Harry and Meghan's previous claim - made in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey - that a member of the Royal Family had raised questions about the skin colour of their future child.\n\nPrince Harry again did not name the individual - and suggested this might have been a case of \"unconscious bias\" rather than racism.\n\nAsked if he would see the questioning as racist, he said: \"I wouldn't, not having lived within that family.\"\n\nHe rejected that he had accused members of the Royal Family of racism in the Oprah interview, saying the \"British press had said that\".\n\nPrince Harry made repeated criticisms of the tabloid press - saying that it was his \"life's work\" to change the media landscape.",

Instead, the duke gives special thanks to friends in the UK \"who stuck by\" him \"amongst the fog\", adding: \"Next round's on me.\"\n\nHarry also says his therapist helped him \"unravel years of unresolved trauma\".\n\nThe revelations about tensions with the Royal Family, including Camilla, the Queen Consort, and the Prince and Princess of Wales, have provoked much controversy.\n\nBut Prince Harry said the divide between him and his family \"couldn't [have been] greater before this book\" when asked if its publication would help with, or hinder, the chance of reconciliation.\n\n\"There are things that will still anger me, but I'm not angry any more, because I am exactly where I am supposed to be,\" he told Good Morning America.\n\nDespite the leaks, many queued late into the night to buy the memoir.\n\nProfessor Chris Imafidon, from Epping, was in line at Victoria Station and said he was \"extremely curious\" to hear why Harry had stepped back from royal life.\n\n\"I really want to know from the horse's mouth,\" he said.\n\nAlso in the queue was bartender Sasha Pursell, 27, who has moved to London from Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\"I'm just intrigued,\" she said. \"I've heard so much press about the book and it's also just a bit exciting - I've never been to a midnight release.\"\n\nAnd Sarah Nakana, 46, from south London, said she had already downloaded the audiobook because she wanted to try to \"get ahead of the British press and their narratives\".\n\nShe added she needed \"to cut the noise here, read it and be like, 'fine, I can move on now'\".\n\nReporters and photographers gathered round the first customers at WH Smith. Large retailers have already been selling the book at half price\n\nOpinion polling from YouGov, published on Monday, showed an initial dip in Prince Harry's popularity in the UK.\n\nThere were 64% of people who had a negative view of Prince Harry, compared with 26% who had a positive view of him, down from 33% in the autumn, and the lowest figure in more than a decade of this regular survey.\n\nFive years ago this tracking survey, based on a sample of about 1,700 adults, showed 80% had been positive about Harry.\n\nBut the latest figures for January 2023 showed more support among young people, aged 18-24, with numbers almost evenly split between those with positive and negative views of Prince Harry.",

            "content": "Charlene Lyons says if she passed all costs on she would have to charge \u00a310 a pint\n\nBusinesses are still digesting a government announcement detailing how support for energy bills will change once the current scheme runs out in March.\n\nBut the initial reaction so far seems to be one of disappointment - and fear.\n\n\"Energy prices will still absolutely soar for us and for everybody else as well,\" said Charlene Lyons, chief executive at Black Sheep Brewery in Yorkshire.\n\nThe new \"energy bills discount scheme\" for business will differ substantially from the current arrangement in terms of how taxpayer-funded help is applied.\n\nUnder existing support, the government has capped gas and electricity bills for companies meaning that if prices rise above a ceiling, it is the state that bears the cost.\n\nThe new scheme, set to launch in April, will apply a discount to wholesale energy prices. If wholesale prices rise, it will be the business that takes the pain.\n\nBefore unveiling the new energy scheme, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt called the current support \"unsustainably expensive\". It will cost \u00a318bn over six months. In contrast, the new package will run for a year at \u00a35.5bn.\n\nAs an energy-intensive business, Black Sheep Brewery will get a steeper discount under the new scheme.\n\nBut the company also owns five pubs which will not benefit from the bigger discount and neither will the many pubs that Black Sheep Brewery supplies.\n\nMs Lyons said: \"We know that if pubs don't get the same level of support they are going to be impacted in the same ways they have been impacted recently which is shorter opening times.\"\n\nIn its announcement, the government said that energy-intensive businesses, such as manufacturers, will get more support because they \"are often less able to pass through cost to their customers due to international competition\".\n\nBut it is not exactly easy for other businesses either.\n\n\"If we were to push all of the price increases over to the consumer across the board, whether it be energy, input costs of raw materials and everything you'd be talking about over \u00a310 a pint, which is clearly not sustainable,\" said Ms Lyons.\n\nBoat yard owner Sarah Curtis says she is relatively lucky \"for now\" because she was able to lock-in energy prices until 2026\n\nRaoul Perfitt, who runs Herb UK, a haircare production firm in Lymington, said he has already seen huge resistance from retailers when he suggests he might need to pass on higher costs.\n\nHerb UK has seen increases across wage bills, manufacturing, raw materials and warehouse rental costs over the past year.\n\nBut Mr Perfitt is at least happy that the new energy scheme gives the company some certainty to plan beyond March when the existing arrangement ends.\n\n\"Obviously we need time to assess exactly how much this will reduce our bills by. But in the current extremely challenging economic conditions any assistance is very welcome.\" he said.\n\nSome businesses, however, might not make it at all according to Martin McTague, chair of small firm lobby group Federation of Small Businesses.\n\n\"We know there are roughly one in four businesses that are seriously considering their future,\" he said. \"I know a lot of small business owners are saying to themselves 'do I wait and see what happens in March or do I decide to cash my chips in now?'.\"\n\nThose that can stick it out find themselves facing tough choices.\n\nAdrian Hanrahan, managing director of Robinson Brothers, a chemicals producer in West Bromwich, welcomed the government's new energy support scheme: \"All help is very, very welcome.\"\n\nRobinson Brothers' managing director Adrian Hanrahan expects his energy bill to triple this year\n\nBut he said: \"We're a small company, our energy is tripling this year which means that being a small company we have one pot of money.\n\n\"I fear that redirecting our money away from innovation into basically survival is not a good thing for the business and it's not a good thing for UK plc either.\"\n\nCompanies have received billions of pounds worth of government support since Covid emerged in early 2020, including the furlough scheme.\n\nSarah Curtis, who runs a boat yard in Ipswich, concedes that state support \"has to be paid back\".\n\n\"At some point the government has to get realistic and no doubt business will share the brunt of that,\" she said.\n\nMs Curtis, who has run the business for 17 years and employs four people, said that she is relatively lucky \"for now\" because she was able to lock-in energy prices until 2026.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing ahead. \"It's going to get worse for all of us before it gets better,\" said Ms Curtis.\n\nHow is your business being affected by the rising cost of energy?

            "section": null,
            "content": "Wales captain Gareth Bale has announced his retirement from football at the age of 33 after a glittering career.\n\nThe nation's most-capped male player and record men's goalscorer announced his decision on social media.\n\nBale, a five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, is arguably Wales' finest ever footballer.\n\n\"After careful and thoughtful consideration, I announce my immediate retirement from club and international football,\" Bale said.\n\n\"I feel incredibly fortunate to have realised my dream of playing the sport I love.\"\n\nCardiff-born Bale's club career took him from Southampton to Tottenham Hotspur and a world record transfer to Spanish giants Real before his move to Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC in June 2022.\n\nHe was his country's talisman as they reached the 2016 and 2020 European Championships before he led Wales at their first World Cup since 1958 at Qatar 2022, ending his international career with 41 goals in 111 appearances.\n\nBale was twice named footballer of the year while at Tottenham, in 2010-11 and 2012-13, and moved to Real for what was then a world-record fee of more than \u00a380m in September 2013.\n\nDuring his time in the Spanish capital, Bale helped Real win three league titles and five Champions League titles - a number no other British player has matched - along with three Club World Cups, three Uefa Super Cups and a Spanish cup.\n\n\"It [football] has truly given me some of the best moments of my life,\" added Bale.\n\n\"The highest of highs over 17 seasons, that will be impossible to replicate, no matter what the next chapter has in store for me.\"\n\nFrom St Mary's to the Bernabeu\n\nBale had joined Tottenham in a deal worth a reported \u00a310m in 2007 having played 45 times for Southampton, scoring five goals.\n\nHaving been used primarily as a left-back in his early career, he really began to thrive in a Spurs shirt when operating further forward, catching the eye especially with a scintillating hat-trick in the Champions League at the San Siro against European champions Inter Milan.\n\nBale's scintillating Spurs form secured the move to Real, where his spell was not always positive despite the fact he scored 104 goals in more than 250 appearances for the club, including two in a match-winning performances in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool.\n\nThat was one of five European titles with Real, but injuries and inconsistent form leading to fewer first-team opportunities as his time in Spain went on.\n\nIn 2019, Bale looked on the verge of moving to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning but the proposed transfer broke down, with the forward saying at the time that Real had \"blocked\" the move.\n\nHis relationship with the Spanish giants was further impacted after he celebrated Wales' qualification for Euro 2020 with a Welsh flag emblazoned with the words 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order'.\n\nHe returned to Tottenham on loan in 2021-22 - and scored 17 goals to give him an overall Spurs record of 72 goals in 237 games at a club where he is still adored - before making just seven club appearances for Madrid in the following campaign, his last as a Real player.\n\nAfter his Real contract expired, Bale joined LAFC on a 12-month deal, though his spell in the US was blighted by fitness issues.\n\nBale managed 13 appearances - including only two starts - for LAFC, though he did help the club lift the MLS Cup for the first time in November by scoring a last-minute equaliser in extra time to set up a penalty shootout which his side won.\n\n\"To show my gratitude to all of those that have played their part along this journey feels like an impossibility,\" Bale said.\n\n\"I feel indebted to many people for helping to change my life and shape my career in a way I couldn't have ever dreamed of when I first started out at nine years old.\n\n\"To my previous clubs Southampton, Tottenham, Real Madrid and finally LAFC, all of my previous managers and coaches, backroom staff, team-mates, all the dedicated fans, my agents, my amazing friends and family, the impact you have had is immeasurable.\n\n\"My parents and my sister, without your dedication in the early days, without such a strong foundation, I wouldn't be writing this statement right now, so thank you for putting me on this path and for your unwavering support.\n\n\"My wife and my children, your love and support has carried me through. Right beside me for all the highs and lows keeping me grounded along the way, you inspire me to be better and to make you proud.\n\n\"So I move on with anticipation to the next stage of my life, a time of change in transition and opportunity for a new adventure.\"\n\nWhile he faced criticism at times from Real fans, Bale's contribution was never questioned by Welsh fans.\n\nWales went out of the recent World Cup at the group stage, with their loss to England proving to be the final appearance of Bale's career.\n\nIt was not a fitting end for a player who achieved extraordinary feats with his country.\n\nBale made his Southampton debut as a 16-year-old in April 2006, and his first senior cap followed a matter of weeks later.\n\nThat made Bale Wales' youngest international - although that record has since been broken.\n\nThat first appearance, in a friendly against Trinidad & Tobago in May 2006, marked the start of a Wales career in which Bale inspired his country to the best spell in their history.\n\nHaving ended a 58-year wait for a major tournament appearance by qualifying for Euro 2016, Wales produced a sensational run to the semi-finals, only losing to eventual winners Portugal.\n\nThey also made it to the knockout stages of the next European Championship before last summer's play-off final win over Ukraine saw Wales clinch their long-awaited return to the World Cup.\n\n\"My decision to retire from international football has been by far the hardest of my career,\" Bale said.\n\n\"How do I describe what being a part of this country and team means to me? How do I articulate the impact it has had on my life? How do I put into words the way I felt every single time I put on that Welsh shirt? My answer is that I couldn't possibly do any of those things justice simply with words.\n\n\"But I know that every person involved in Welsh football feels the magic and is impacted in such a powerful and unique way, so I know you feel what I feel without using any words at all.\n\n\"My journey on the international stage is one that has changed not only my life but who I am. The fortune of being Welsh and being selected to play for and captain Wales has given me something incomparable to anything else I've experienced.\n\n\"I'm honoured and humbled to have been able to play a part in the history of this incredible country, to have felt the support and passion of the Red Wall and together have been to unexpected and amazing places.\n\n\"I shared a dressing room with boys that became brothers and backroom staff that became family.\n\n\"I played for the most incredible managers and felt the undying support and love from the most dedicated fans in the world. Thank you to every one of you for being on this journey with me.\n\n\"So for now I am stepping back but not away from the team that lives in me and runs through my veins after all the dragon on my shirt is all I need.\"\n\u2022 None Some of the greatest and most inspiring stories in Welsh football\n\u2022 None The transformation of the Wales football team",

The docs and nurses at Buffalo General have already made me feel at home!\"\n\nThe American football community rallied in support of Hamlin, raising millions of dollars for charity in his name before making tributes at NFL matches when play resumed at the weekend.\n\nHe added on Twitter : \"Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart. Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling. The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world n more. Bigger than football!\"\n\nThe most poignant show of support for Hamlin came in the Bills' return to action on Sunday, when they beat the New England Patriots at home to clinch second seed in the AFC for the play-offs.\n\n'It's up to Damar' - doctor on Hamlin's chances of NFL return\n\nDr Knight, who accompanied Hamlin from UCMC to the airport before his transfer to Buffalo, believes it is too early to say whether the Bills player could resurrect his NFL career.\n\n\"It's entirely too premature to discuss his football, we're focused on his day-to-day recovery,\" Dr Knight told reporters during a briefing.\n\n\"He still has a ways to go in terms of his recovery. We're thrilled where he is today. But in terms of any kind of conjecture about his future, that's still significantly into the future. It's going to be up to Damar.\"\n\nTimothy Pritts, a physician at UCMC, said they had not yet determined the cause of his cardiac arrest .\n\n\"We anticipate that he will undergo an ongoing series of tests and evaluations,\" he added, predicting a normal recovery time could range from \"weeks to months\".\n\n\"He appears to be neurologically completely intact and there's no reason to believe that he won't continue his path to recovery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bengals coach Zac Taylor described Hamlin's return to Buffalo as \"unbelievable\".\n\n\"I mean, just think about it - that was one week,\" he said. \"There's no one in this room that would have expected he'd be in Buffalo.

            "content": "The World Bank, led by President David Malpass, says the economies of the US, Eurozone and China are all struggling\n\nThe global economy is \"perilously close to falling into recession\", according to the latest forecast from the World Bank.\n\nIt expects the world economy to grow by just 1.7% this year - a sharp decrease from the 3% it predicted in June.\n\nThe report blames a number of factors stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe effects of higher interest rates are picked out as the key challenge for policy makers to overcome.\n\nWorld Bank president David Malpass said the downturn would be \"broad-based\" and growth in people's earnings in almost every part of the world was likely to \"be slower than it was during the decade before Covid-19\".\n\nThe 1.7% growth figure would be the lowest since 1991, with the exceptions of the recessions of 2009 and 2020, which were caused by the global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe World Bank said the US, the Eurozone and China - the three most influential parts of the world for economic growth - were \"all undergoing a period of pronounced weakness\", a downturn that was worsening the problems faced by poorer countries.\n\nAfter surging 5.3% in post-pandemic 2021, growth in the world's richest economies is likely to slow sharply from 2.5% in 2022 to just 0.5% this year.\n\n\"Over the past two decades, slowdowns of this scale have foreshadowed a global recession,\" the bank warned, adding that it anticipated \"a sharp, long-lasting slowdown\".\n\nIf a global recession were to occur, it would be the first time since the 1930s that there have been two global recessions within the same decade.\n\nHigher inflation is one of the main reasons that the global economy is struggling. Global food and energy prices jumped last year as the war in Ukraine led to reduced crop supplies and pushed the West to move away from Russian fossil fuels.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Why are things so expensive? The BBC's Faisal Islam answers your inflation questions in 90 seconds\n\nThe World Bank said it expected the global pace of price rises to slow from 7.6% in 2022 to 5.2% this year, as those pressures ease.\n\nWhile some \"prices spikes are possible\". the bank said it expected energy prices to fall in general. It pointed to an increase in global production and lower demand in Europe, where an energy crisis has led businesses and households to reduce their use of gas.\n\nCrop prices are also forecast to fall by 5% this year although they will still be significantly higher than they were a few years ago, having risen by 13% in 2022.\n\nDespite those developments, inflation is expected to remain well above the 2% rate typically considered healthy.\n\nCentral banks in dozens of countries, including the US and the UK, have been raising interest rates in response to the problem, aiming to cool their economies and ease the pressures pushing up prices.\n\nBut they are navigating a delicate path as they try to address the cost-of-living crisis while not tipping their economies into recession.\n\nThe World Bank said higher borrowing costs have stifled business investments and warned that more companies were struggling with their debts. Developing economies are also being squeezed hard by US interest rates, which are expected to rise further. Many of them borrow money in US dollars.\n\nThe Bank said that even with the global economy \"under pressure\" the right government policies could offer hope. It recommended measures to boost investments and create jobs, tackle climate change, address the debts of poorer countries and facilitate international trade.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Let's be blunt: we are not wildly closer to all these strike rows being sorted out than we were.\n\nBut it is also true that we were never likely to be, after a series of short meetings between trades union officials and government ministers earlier.\n\nThe tone, though, has undeniably shifted, on the government side and among at least some of the unions.\n\nMinisters continue to hint, both publicly and privately, that they might be willing to compromise - although the details of how they might do this don't appear worked through yet.\n\nIt is worth remembering the basis upon which today's talks between ministers and unions were convened.\n\nIt was to talk about what pay might look like in the next financial year starting in April - not the pay striking workers are receiving now, which in many instances is the root cause of the current industrial action.\n\nBut what was also hinted at over the weekend by the prime minister publicly, and other government sources privately, was that there may be scope to do something about pay now.\n\nCould a one-off hardship payment in various sectors caught up in industrial action be an option?\n\nIt is an idea being explored by the Labour government in Wales, and it is not being instantly dismissed at Westminster for England any more.\n\nAn idea that just a few short weeks ago before Christmas was flatly rejected by Downing Street and the Treasury, having been floated by Health Secretary Steve Barclay, now appears to be back in play.\n\nAnd here's another idea being discussed: backdating any pay deal for the next financial year to the start of this calendar year, giving workers another three months at whatever rate they secure in the pay settlement now being worked on.\n\nBoth of these options would allow ministers to say they haven't reopened the existing pay settlement, but would also allow them to say they have listened to what the trades unions are saying.\n\nBut they are, at least as things stand, signals of potential intent, rather than anything more concrete.\n\nHow much would a one-off payment be? \"A few hundred quid? No way. A thousand quid? Well, maybe we'd be getting somewhere,\" one union source suggested to me.\n\nWhat would be the level of pay backdated to the beginning of this year? We, and the unions, don't know.\n\nAmbulance worker strikes are set to continue later this week\n\nAll of this illustrates a subtlety playing out on both sides. There can be disagreements within government.\n\n\"A settlement needs to be arranged, and quickly,\" said one government source, pointing out there is always a resolution in the end, so it made sense to do one sooner rather than later to minimise the damage strike action can cause.\n\nAnother emphasised that the central truth, as they saw it, is there isn't any money left in government coffers and plenty of workers in sectors without a big union presence are struggling, so why should they cave into union demands?\n\nAnd, yes, there are disagreements, or at the very least differences of emphasis, between trades unions: Unite were much more angry and condemning of the government after the meeting at the Department of Health than Unison were.\n\nBut all this also highlights some simple, bald truths.\n\nThere are industrial disputes playing out in different nations of the UK, in different sectors, involving different unions and different governments. Plenty, in all the nations, look rather difficult to sort out.\n\nAs far as England is concerned, after this set of meetings, the strikes that were already in the diary are still in the diary.\n\nNext, the government moves onto the other side of its approach: introducing a new law to attempt to limit their impact in half a dozen different sectors.\n\nThe bill, the planned new law to do this, is to be published, with Business Secretary Grant Shapps heading out and about to make the case for it.\n\nA pragmatic response to strike action in some of our most vital public services? Or a draconian limitation on the capacity of workers to legally withdraw their labour?",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: The jumbo, called Cosmic Girl, and its rocket left Newquay just after 22:00 GMT\n\nThe first ever satellite mission launched from UK soil has ended in failure.\n\nA jumbo jet operated by the American Virgin Orbit company carried a rocket out of Newquay, Cornwall, to release it high over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe rocket ignited and appeared to be ascending correctly. But word then came from the company that the rocket had suffered an \"anomaly\".\n\nThe satellites it was carrying could not be released and were lost.\n\nThe mission had been billed as a major milestone for UK space, marking the birth of a home-grown launch industry. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports.\n\nDeputy CEO of the UK Space Agency, Ian Annett, said it showed \"how difficult\" getting into orbit actually was - but predicted further launches within the next 12 months.\n\n\"We get up, we go back, we try again, that's what defines us,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nMatt Archer, the agency's launch programme director, said the issue occurred in the upper segment of the rocket.\n\n\"The second-stage engine had a technical anomaly and didn't reach the required orbit,\" he explained.\n\n\"That's now part of an investigation by Virgin Orbit and a number of government departments,\" he told BBC News.\n\nMr Archer could not confirm whether the rocket had fallen back to Earth but said that if it did, it would have come down over unpopulated areas.\n\nThe satellites were insured so their manufacturers and operators will be compensated.\n\nThe Virgin Orbit system is relatively new. It's only been in operation since 2020.\n\nIt suffered a failure on its maiden outing but this was followed up by four successful flights.\n\nDan Hart, the CEO of Virgin Orbit, said: \"We are mindful that we failed to provide our customers with the launch service they deserve. The first-time nature of this mission added layers of complexity that our team professionally managed through; however, in the end a technical failure appears to have prevented us from delivering the final orbit.\n\n\"We will work tirelessly to understand the nature of the failure, make corrective actions, and return to orbit as soon as we have completed a full investigation and mission assurance process.\"\n\nMelissa Thorpe: \"We put so much into this, everybody has, so it is absolutely gutting\"\n\nRockets have been sent to space from the UK before, but not to put satellites in orbit. Those earlier efforts were part of military exercises or for atmospheric research, and the vehicles involved came straight back down.\n\nInternationally renowned for making satellites of all sizes, the country's space industry has always had to send its products to foreign spaceports to get them into orbit.\n\nAdding a launch capability means the sector will in future be able to do everything from first design through to mission operations.\n\nMore than 2,000 spectators and VIPs had gathered at Cornwall Newquay Airport to watch the 747 leave. They drifted away as news filtered through that something had gone wrong.\n\nTickets for the launch event were snapped up. There was great enthusiasm from the crowd\n\nMonday night's failure is a blow to all those involved: Virgin Orbit, the satellite owners and Spaceport Cornwall which organised the flight.\n\n\"It's been really emotional,\" said Melissa Thorpe, who heads the spaceport.\n\n\"We put so much into this, everybody has, so it is absolutely gutting. But it's space and the clich\u00e9 is it's hard. We know it's hard.\"\n\nShe added that the first part of the mission - the drop from the plane - had gone to plan and she was confident they would be able to embark on another mission in the \"near future\".\n\nMr Hart from Virgin Orbit went to commiserate with his team in Cornwall, accompanied by UK science minister George Freeman.\n\nIn a tweet, the minister made reference to the famous quote from 1960s US President John F Kennedy: \"We do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard.\"\n\nAircraft and shipping have been told to stay out of the launch zone\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "content": "The ozone layer - which is on track for recovery - protects against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun\n\nHuman action to save the ozone layer has worked as hoped, and it may recover in just decades, the UN says.\n\nAn international agreement in 1987 to stop using the harmful chemicals that were damaging the layer has been successful, the major assessment says.\n\nThe ozone layer is a thin part of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\n\nWhen it is depleted, this radiation can reach the surface - causing potential harm to humans and other living things.\n\nUltraviolet rays can damage DNA and cause sunburn, increasing the long-term risk of problems such as skin cancer.\n\nThe ozone layer began depleting in the 1970s.\n\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were commonly found in spray cans, fridges, foam insulation and air conditioners, were blamed for eating away at the ozone layer.\n\nA gaping hole in the layer was discovered by scientists in 1985. Just two years later, the Montreal Protocol was signed - with 46 countries promising to phase out the harmful chemicals.\n\nThe deal later became the first UN treaty to achieve universal ratification, and almost 99% of banned ozone-depleting substances have now been phased out.\n\nThe Antarctic ozone hole continued expanding until 2000, after which its area and depth began improving slowly.\n\nNow, a report co-produced by UN, US and EU agencies says the Montreal Protocol is working as hoped.\n\nIt says that, if current policies are maintained, the ozone layer will be restored to 1980 values - before the ozone hole appeared - at different points in different places:\n\nWhile the depletion of ozone is harmful due to solar radiation, it is not a major cause of climate change.\n\nBut saving the ozone layer has had a positive knock-on effect on global warming, the report suggests, because some of the harmful chemicals that were phased out are powerful greenhouse gases.\n\nThat phase-out will have prevented up to 1C of warming by the middle of the century - if compared to increasing their use by 3% per year, the scientists found.\n\nWhile the report has been hailed as good news - and evidence that rapid, international action to avert environmental crises can work - it warns that continued progress on the ozone layer is not guaranteed.\n\nFor example, proposals to limit global warming by sending millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere - known as stratospheric aerosol injection - could drastically reverse the ozone layer's recovery.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Prince Harry reaches the royal parts never reached before\n\nThis must be the strangest book ever written by a royal.\n\nPrince Harry's memoir, Spare, is part confession, part rant and part love letter. In places it feels like the longest angry drunk text ever sent.\n\nIt's the view from inside what he calls a \"surreal fishbowl\" and \"unending Truman Show\".\n\nIt's disarmingly frank and intimate - showing the sheer weirdness of his often isolated life. And it's the small details, rather than the set-piece moments, that give a glimpse of how little we really knew.\n\nThere are glimpses of him as a royal stoner, smoking a joint after dinner and worrying the smoke was going to blow over to his elderly neighbour the Duke of Kent.\n\nWhat other royal recollection would cover losing his virginity behind a pub, or go into such prolonged detail about a frost-bitten penis? This royal appendage gets more lines than many of his relatives. Maybe there should be a spoiler alert for the special cushion that's made.\n\nHe was also keenly conscious of girls with \"throne syndrome\", who would be \"visibly fitting herself with a crown the moment she shook my hand\".\n\nOr there's the story about when he's in Buckingham Palace during the Golden Jubilee concert and listening to Brian May playing on the roof - and notices his grandmother Queen Elizabeth is wearing earplugs.\n\nHis pre-Meghan life in London was ostensibly full of luxury, but it also feels as though he was undercover in his own life.\n\nHarry suffered from appalling panic attacks, awful for anyone, but debilitating for someone expected to speak and appear in public.\n\nHe describes his lonely life at home, self-medicating with psychedelic drugs, drying his clothes on a radiator and planning shopping trips like military raids, to be carried out in disguise and at speed.\n\nPrincess Diana and Harry: The book describes the trauma he felt at her loss\n\nHe doesn't have an Amazon account, but he hits TK Maxx for clothes, and carries out a weekly food shop in a supermarket, rehearsing exactly where to find his favourite salmon and yoghurts. When he's in there one day he overhears shoppers debating whether he's gay.\n\nBut it's a profoundly odd life, moving suddenly between this lack of glamour to time with the international jet set.\n\nHarry says he watches the TV show Friends on a loop, identifying with the funny guy character of Chandler. But then on a trip to the US he is at a party with Courteney Cox, the actress who plays Chandler's on-screen wife, Monica.\n\nAnd this really is a trip, because he ends up taking hallucinogenic drugs and watches a pedal-bin coming to life. It's a long way from the commentary for Trooping the Colour.\n\nThe ghost-written work is a fast-paced, quickfire account, looking out from the inside, always scratchily aware of the bodyguards outside the door and the cameras waiting to catch him. As a schoolboy, smoking cannabis with his friends, he watches the police outside there to guard him.\n\nLeaks of the book revealed the scale of the conflict between Prince William and Prince Harry\n\nAt the very centre of this story, permeating almost every page, is the huge trauma that seems to have distorted the rest of his life - the death of his mother Princess Diana.\n\nHe adored her unreservedly and an overwhelming sense of unresolved grief is at the hub of all his other anxieties, like spokes on a wheel.\n\nHe really, really hates the press, blaming them for chasing his mother so relentlessly, including in the events leading to her death in Paris, with Harry returning obsessively to the scene of the car accident.\n\nHis anger at the news media is wide ranging, but Rupert Murdoch is singled out in particular and one of his executives is only described in anagram form, so much is his allergic reaction.\n\nThe rows with his brother Prince William are often framed by references to the closeness they had previously had with their mother.\n\nHis paralysing anxiety and self-destructiveness also seem to be consequences of the loss of his mother, taking away an emotional anchor that, until meeting Meghan, he had never replaced.\n\nKing Charles tried to offer support to Harry after the death of his mother\n\nWarning: Some strong language is used in the following paragraphs\n\nThere is also something of a death obsession. Going into Westminster Abbey for his brother's wedding he cheerfully thinks about the 3,000 people buried in the church over the centuries.\n\nWhat's missing from the book is any sense of awareness of any wider context of the rest of the world outside. It's as if he has been blinded by the paparazzi flashlights. No one worries about paying gas bills in this book. He's back and forth to Africa like he was going a few stops on the Northern Line.\n\nAlthough, that would have been more exotic for him because he says the only time he got on a Tube train was on a school trip.\n\nWhile copiously indiscreet about the interior of royal life - yes, that's his father doing physio exercises in his boxers - it remains strangely silent on any views about the outside world, even though he's no longer a working royal.\n\nThere are some glimpses. Harry talks about Prince William making what he calls a \"vaguely anti-Brexit speech\" which seems to annoy the tabloids.\n\n\"Brexit was their bread and butter. How dare he suggest it was bullshit,\" he writes.\n\nThe other royals are claimed by Prince Harry to be obsessing over the score sheets of how many visits they've carried out compared with other family members, looking over their shoulders in case anyone should question their purpose.\n\nBut he is also unmistakably a creature of his own upbringing, describing shooting a deer in a way that doesn't feel like the new-age therapy version of Californian Harry.\n\nSo who will be most upset about all these revelations in his book?\n\nNetflix mostly. They paid a prince's ransom for six hours of TV waffle and the smug contents of an Instagram feed, whereas the book crackles like a burning log with something bizarre on almost every page.\n\nPlenty of the book will get people irritated too, particularly its self-absorption. He talks about a row over people parking near his palace accommodation with more detail than you'd expect from a small war.\n\nThere are some off-the-wall claims too, such as comparing the Spice Girls' \"crusade against sexism\" with \"Mandela's struggle against apartheid\".\n\nThe leaks of the book have focused on the family conflicts and Harry's resentment at a lack of support for him and Meghan.\n\nCamilla arrives in the story to become his stepmother, with the narrative exuding a mixture of suspicion and a determined effort to be polite. But mostly suspicion really. It feels a bit divorced dad telling everyone he's not bitter, he doesn't mind that he paid for everything, really, not bitter at all, just wishing them both well...\n\nBut taken as a whole, beyond the excerpts, a much warmer picture emerges of his father, King Charles, even when it seems that the narrator is giving him a hard time.\n\nCharles is seen padding around in his slippers, listening to his audio-books, obsessed with Shakespeare, wearing Dior scent and falling asleep at his desk. He's seen as having faced terrible school bullying, still keeping a teddy bear as a totem of a lonely childhood.\n\nHis father tries to provide some emotional support for Harry after Diana's death, sitting up with him until he falls asleep at night, but it feels as though his good intentions had to navigate some tricky barriers.\n\nCharles leaves notes for him trying to say nice things - but Harry questions why he couldn't say them in person. He goes to see Harry in a school play and laughs uproariously and is then criticised by his son for laughing in the wrong places.\n\nWhen the adult brothers are feuding, Charles begins to sound like something of a Shakespearean figure himself, King Lear in tweed, begging his sons not to make his old age a misery.\n\nThe King is presented as old fashioned and rather unworldly. But he might be learning a new bit of text speak. TMI. Too much information...",

Reports say he left the hospital on Tuesday.\n\nMr Bolsonaro said on Tuesday that he intended to return to Brazil, telling CNN that he would bring forward his departure from the US, which was originally scheduled for the end of January.\n\nA day after the riots, heavily armed officers started dismantling a camp of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters in Bras\u00edlia - one of a number that have been set up outside army barracks around the country since the presidential election.\n\nMr Torres, who previously served as Mr Bolsonaro's justice minister, was fired from his role as Secretary of Public Security on Sunday by Bras\u00edlia governor Ibaneis Rocha.\n\nMr Rocha was himself later removed from his post for 90 days by the Supreme Court.\n\nLula has also taken aim at the security forces, accusing them of \"incompetence, bad faith or malice\" for failing to stop demonstrators accessing Congress.\n\n\"You will see in the images that they [police officers] are guiding people on the walk to Praca dos Tres Powers,\" he said. \"We are going to find out who the financiers of these vandals who went to Bras\u00edlia are and they will all pay with the force of law.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Brazilian outlet O Globo showed some officers laughing and taking photos together as demonstrators occupied the congressional campus in the background.\n\nProtesters had been gathering since the morning on the lawns in front of the parliament and up and down the kilometre of the Esplanada avenue, which is lined with government ministries and national monuments.\n\nDespite the actions of the protesters, in the hours before the chaos, security had appeared tight, with the roads closed for about a block around the parliament area and armed police pairs guarding every entrance into the area.\n\nThe BBC had seen about 50 police officers around on Sunday morning local time and cars were turned away at entry points, while those entering on foot were frisked by police checking bags.\n\nAccording to Katy Watson, the BBC's South America correspondent, some protesters aren't just angry that Mr Bolsonaro lost the election - they want President Lula to return to prison.\n\nMr Bolsonaro has gone very quiet since losing October's elections, she said, adding that in not publicly conceding defeat, he's allowed his most ardent supporters to remain angry over a democratic election that he legitimately lost.\n\nThe former president condemned the attack and denied responsibility for encouraging the rioters in a post on Twitter some six hours after violence broke out.\n\nOn Tuesday, his son, Brazilian Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, said people should not try to link his father to the riots, stating that he has been silently \"licking his wounds\" since losing the election.",

            "content": "The Gourock site is one of two distribution centres operated in Scotland by Amazon\n\nAmazon has confirmed plans to close its distribution centre in Gourock, putting about 300 jobs at risk.\n\nThe online retail giant has launched a consultation with staff, but has yet to provide details of when the base will close.\n\nThe Inverclyde site is one of three fulfilment centres earmarked for closure in the UK.\n\nIt is understood that all workers at the sites will be offered roles at other Amazon locations.\n\nThe move comes a few days after Amazon announced plans to cut more than 18,000 jobs globally from its consumer retail business and human resources division, although it is understood the Gourock closure is separate from those plans.\n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman said: \"We're always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our employees and customers.\n\n\"As part of that effort, we may close older sites, enhance existing facilities, or open new sites, and we've launched a consultation on the proposed closure of three fulfilment centres in 2023.\n\n\"All employees affected by site closure consultations will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other facilities, and we remain committed to our customers, employees, and communities across the UK.\"\n\nThe company added that it also planned to open two new fulfilment centres in England, creating 2,500 new jobs over the next three years.\n\nBusiness minister Ivan McKee told the Scottish Parliament he would be meeting representatives of Amazon on Wednesday to \"further discuss and understand the decision\".\n\nHe said the firm's Gourock site has received a total of \u00a32.137m in financial support from the Scottish government, with the last payment made in 2011.\n\nInverclyde MP Ronnie Cowan said he was seeking urgent talks with Amazon over its plans to close the Gourock warehouse.\n\nThe SNP MP tweeted: \"It goes without saying that in the midst of a cost of living crisis this will come as a hammer blow to the staff and their families.\n\n\"Amazon has said it will try to redeploy workers but has so far given me no hard commitments.\"\n\nScottish Conservative MSP for West Scotland Jamie Greene said the potential closure would come as a huge blow to the workforce.\n\nHe added: \"I have requested an urgent meeting with Amazon to see what can be done to either prevent closure or offer full support to the workforce.\"\n\nHe added: \"This community has been battling depopulation and economic decline for many years and this represents a worrying setback.\"\n\nThe Scottish government described the news as \"very disappointing\".\n\nA spokeswoman said Scottish Enterprise was \"in active discussion with the company to better understand the issues\", adding that the government would \"do everything in its power\" to help those affected.\n\nAmazon's only other Scottish fulfilment centre is based in Dunfermline.\n\nIts operations in Scotland include a development centre in Edinburgh, as well as delivery stations in Motherwell, Baillieston, Dundee, Bathgate and Portlethen, and an Amazon Fresh distribution site in Glasgow.\n\nAmazon is a work in progress, having displaced huge areas of conventional retail and with seemingly boundless ambition to keep growing, from groceries to television, film-making, cloud computing and beyond.\n\nNot all its gambles pay off. For instance, taking over a posh Whole Foods supermarket in Giffnock, to the south of Glasgow, was a stretch for its supply lines.\n\nWhen it moved into its Gourock \"fulfilment centre\" in 2004, it was the second such warehouse in the UK, after Milton Keynes. Back then, it had six in the US and one each in the UK, France, Germany and Japan. Turnover outside North America was less than $700m a year (\u00a3568m at today's rates).\n\nIts reach was on a more modest scale, growing out of books, CDs and DVDs, and 20 years ago, it was expanding into electronics and toys.\n\nBy 2021, it had revenue of $1.29bn (\u00a31.06bn) a day, or $480bn (\u00a3395bn). That growth has been built with a fierce discipline on efficiency and use of data, aiming to have the fastest distribution networks, and now it is increasingly automating its warehouse operations.\n\nIn 2023, it makes less logistical sense to be located at the end of the road through Greenock and along the Inverclyde seafront, requiring delivery trucks to trundle some distance off the motorway network and away from the main population centres.\n\nWhile the other two British fulfilment centres being closed will no longer fulfil customers or local jobs, they are near other Amazon centres and numerous other English warehousing operations.\n\nFor the workforce in Inverclyde, it will be more difficult to transition into similar work - the nearest Amazon centre is near Dunfermline in Fife.\n\nIt may not feel like much consolation as Gourock closes, but turnover of staff at Amazon is particularly high. The labour market is tight and favours those searching for jobs. And although it has travelled a hard road since the decline of shipbuilding, Inverclyde has learned to adapt to economic and technological change.",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "More than 650,000 deaths were registered in the UK in 2022 - 9% more than 2019.\n\nThis represents one of the largest excess death levels outside the pandemic in 50 years.\n\nThough far below peak pandemic levels, it has prompted questions about why more people are still dying than normal.\n\nData indicates pandemic effects on health and NHS pressures are among the leading explanations.\n\nCovid is still killing people, but is involved in fewer deaths now than at the start of the pandemic. Roughly 38,000 deaths involved Covid in 2022 compared with more than 95,000 in 2020.\n\nWe are still seeing more deaths overall than would be expected based on recent history. The difference in 2022 - compared with 2020 and 2021 - is that Covid deaths were one of several factors, rather than the main explanation for this excess.\n\nSo what else might be going on?\n\nA number of doctors are blaming the wider crisis in the NHS.\n\nAt the start of 2022, death rates were looking like they'd returned to pre-pandemic levels. It wasn't until June that excess deaths really started to rise - just as the number of people waiting for hours on trolleys in English hospitals hit levels normally seen in winter.\n\nOn 1 January 2023, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine suggested the crisis in urgent care could be causing \"300-500 deaths a week\".\n\nIt is not a figure recognised by NHS England, but it's roughly what you get if you multiply the number of people waiting long periods in A&E with the extra risk of dying estimated to come with those long waits (of between five and 12 hours).\n\nIt is possible to debate the precise numbers, but it's not controversial to say that your chances are worse if you wait longer for treatment, be that waiting for an ambulance to get to you, being stuck in an ambulance outside a hospital or in A&E.\n\nAnd we are seeing record waits in each of those areas.\n\nIn November, for example, it took 48 minutes on average for an ambulance in England to respond to a suspected heart attack or stroke, compared to a target of 18 minutes.\n\nSome of the excess may be people whose deaths were hastened by the after-effects of a Covid infection.\n\nA number of studies have found people are more likely to have heart problems and strokes in the weeks and months after catching Covid, and some of these may not end up being linked to the virus when the death is registered.\n\nAs well as the impact on the heart of the virus itself, some of this may be contributed to by the fact many people didn't come in for screenings and non-urgent treatment during the peak of the pandemic, storing up trouble for the future.\n\nWe can see that the number of people starting treatment for blood pressure or with statins - which can help prevent future heart attacks - plunged during the pandemic and, a year later still hadn't recovered.\n\nThe largest jump in excess deaths was seen in men aged 50-64, most commonly caused by heart problems.\n\nThe rise in cardiac problems has been pointed to by some online as evidence that Covid vaccines are driving the rise in deaths, but this conclusion is not supported by the data.\n\nOne type of Covid vaccine has been linked to a small rise in cases of heart inflammation and scarring (pericarditis and myocarditis). But this particular vaccine side-effect was mainly seen in boys and young men, while the excess deaths are highest in older men - aged 50 or more.\n\nAnd these cases are too rare - and mostly not fatal - to account for the excess in deaths.\n\nFinally, figures up to June 2022 looking at deaths from all causes show unvaccinated people were more likely to die than vaccinated people.\n\nWhile this data on its own can't tell us it's the vaccine protecting people from dying - there are too many complicating factors - if vaccines were driving excess deaths we would expect this to be the other way around.",

            "section": "Health",
            "content": "The NHS is in the middle of its worst winter in a generation, with senior doctors warning that hospitals are facing intolerable pressures that are costing lives.\n\nA&E waits and ambulance delays are at their worst levels on record.\n\nThe health service was already under pressure - the result of long-standing problems - but Covid, flu and now strike action by staff have all added to the sense of crisis this winter.\n\nSo how did the NHS get to this point?\n\nAdvances in medicine over recent decades have meant people are living longer.\n\nThat is a success story. But it means the NHS, like every health service in the developed world, is having to cope with an ageing population.\n\nThat puts a huge strain on the health service. Half of over-65s have two or more health conditions and are responsible for two-thirds of all hospital admissions.\n\nTo help the health service cope with this demand as well as pay for the advances in medicine, the NHS budget has traditionally risen by an average of 4% above inflation each year.\n\nBut since 2010, the average annual rate of increase has been half that.\n\nOf course, that is when a Conservative-led government came into power, although it is worth bearing in mind Labour were also signed up to this squeeze following the 2008 financial crash.\n\nLabour - despite previous big increases in funding - were promising less for the health service than the Tories in the 2010 election, while in 2015 there was little between the two parties.\n\nThe government points to extra funding for the NHS during this parliament and topped up further in the Autumn Statement but a decade of austerity has come at a cost.\n\nBed numbers have fallen, while staffing shortages have increased.\n\nCurrently around one in 10 NHS posts are vacant, leaving the UK with fewer doctors and nurses than many of its Western European counterparts.\n\nThe lack of staff puts even more pressure on those in post.\n\nTalk to paramedics, nurses and doctors and one of the most common refrains is that the job is no longer enjoyable because they cannot provide the level of care they want for their patients.\n\nAlongside pay, this is a driving factor for those ambulance staff and nurses who took strike action last month and look set to do so again in the coming weeks.\n\nIn fact, they argue the two issues are interlinked. Pay for NHS staff has been cut over the past decade once inflation is taken into account.\n\nUntil that is addressed, the government has little chance of plugging the staff gaps, they believe.\n\nHow are your local NHS services coping this winter? Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.\n\nThe problems being seen also have their origins in when the NHS was created in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nThe decision was taken to split health (run by the NHS) and social care for the elderly (run by councils).\n\nMore than 70 years on, and despite some move towards integration, this division still persists.\n\nThis is despite successive governments since the late 1990s all promising major reform.\n\nIt means we have a health system that is free at the point of need, but a care system that is means-tested and has been squeezed even more than the NHS.\n\nThe waiting list for care is rising sharply, while this sector too has a staffing crisis with one in 10 posts also vacant.\n\nSuccessive governments have failed to reform the social care system\n\nThey are two very different systems, despite being two sides of the same coin.\n\nWithout care to keep them independent, the frail elderly are more likely to end up in hospital and less likely to be able to get out.\n\nEvery day more than half of patients who are ready to leave hospital cannot because of a lack of care in the community. Not all of this is down to social care, but much of it is.\n\nThis divide is something that does not exist - certainly not to such an acute extent - in many of the social insurance systems across the world that have been developed much more around the needs of the individual.\n\nOf course, the NHS, like other health systems, has been battered by the pandemic. Waiting lists have grown and staff have been left exhausted from fighting Covid - the latter is another factor that has driven staff to vote for industrial action.\n\nWhat is more, the tail end of the pandemic has had a sting. Other infections, and in particular flu, have rebounded after the lockdowns suppressed cases and immunity.\n\nThe NHS is now in the grip of its worst flu season for a decade - and this has come as the fifth wave of Covid has reared its head.\n\nAnd while the most recent data suggests hospitalisations for both may have peaked, experts are urging caution because reporting delays over the festive period may have masked what is happening.\n\nThere has been another consequence too - the indirect health impacts. This is something England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty warned about at the start of the pandemic and now appears to be taking off.\n\nThe lockdown led to people with chronic conditions not always getting the support they needed - patients with heart problems not getting statins and people with respiratory illness not getting their regular checks for example.\n\nThis is thought to be one factor behind the rising demand being seen on the emergency care system, as well as the higher-than-expected number of deaths being seen.\n\nA frailer, sicker population is adding to the pressure when the NHS and its staff are least able to respond.",

Watch: Video shows fighting in Soledar, Ukraine, but the BBC has been unable to confirm the date these videos were filmed\n\nRussia's mercenary Wagner Group has claimed control over the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine - but Kyiv says its soldiers are holding out.\n\nRussia's media carried a statement purported to be by the Wagner head, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who said Ukrainians were now encircled in the city centre.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar earlier said that \"heavy fighting is continuing\".\n\nThe claims by both sides have not been independently verified.\n\nIn the reported statement late on Tuesday, Mr Prigozhin said: \"Wagner units took control of the entire territory of Soledar. A cauldron has been formed in the centre of the city in which urban fighting is going on.\"\n\nThe statement stressed that only Wagner fighters - who are not part of the Russian armed forces - were taking part \"in the storming\" of Soledar.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Maliar said a few hours before that \"the enemy does not pay attention to the large losses of its personnel and continues to actively storm\".\n\n\"The approaches to our positions are simply strewn with the bodies of dead enemy fighters. Our fighters are defending bravely,\" she added.\n\nThe fall of Soledar - a small salt-mining town in the Donetsk region - could help Russian troops to encircle the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut.\n\nThe UK said earlier on Tuesday that Russian troops and the mercenary Wagner Group were \"likely\" to now be in control of the town.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was \"almost no life\" left in Soledar and \"no whole walls left\".\n\n\"This is what madness looks like,\" he added.\n\nAnd in a new address late on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky praised the resilience of Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe strategic importance of Soledar is debated, but its capture would be significant for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it would allow Russian forces to inch closer to the regional city of Bakhmut. Russia could use access to Soledar's deep, city-like network of salt mine tunnels, dormant since April, to penetrate Ukrainian-controlled territory.\n\nSecondly, invading forces would be able to give Ukraine a taste of its own medicine.\n\nOne thing that has helped Kyiv liberate territory has been its ability to target Russian supply lines.\n\nLong-range missile strikes have often left thousands of invading troops unable to replenish personnel, ammunition, fuel, and rations, and stopped them freely moving military hardware.\n\nThe capturing of Soledar - which had a population of 10,000 before the war - would effectively cut Bakhmut off from a major supply line from nearby Sloviansk.\n\nThe UK said it believed Soledar was close to falling to Russia - but added that the Kremlin was \"unlikely\" to take Bakhmut immediately due to Ukraine's \"stable defence lines\".\n\nA senior military official from the US Department of Defense said earlier on Monday there was a \"good portion\" of Soledar in Russian hands.\n\nFighting around Bakhmut has been going on for months, and the US official described the most recent exchanges as \"savage\".\n\nTwo British nationals have gone missing in the region and were last seen heading to Soledar.\n\nUK nationals Andrew Bagshaw (L) and Christopher Parry (R) were doing voluntary work, police said, but have not been heard of since Friday\n\nDespite the long and intense battle, Oleh Zhdanov - a highly respected military analyst in Ukraine - believes that neither Soledar nor Bakhmut are especially important from an operational point of view.\n\nMr Zhdanov said in an interview on Monday with the Ukrainian newspaper Gazeta that Russia \"is trying to prove to the whole world that its army is capable of winning\".\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think-tank, has said that Mr Prigozhin, \"will continue to use both confirmed and fabricated Wagner Group success in Soledar and Bakhmut to promote the Wagner Group as the only Russian force in Ukraine capable of securing tangible gains\".\n\nRussia has suffered several major setbacks in Ukraine since its invasion nearly a year ago, including losing control of the only regional capital in the south it had managed to capture.\n\nCapturing Soledar would just as much be a propaganda victory for the Kremlin as a military one.\n\nThe gains for Russia are relatively small and costly, but the town would be a much-needed trophy to present to critics back home.",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe Scottish government is to spend an additional \u00a38m in a bid to free up hospital beds by moving patients to care homes.\n\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said there were more than 1,700 people in hospital who do not need to be there.\n\nHe said this was often because care packages that would allow them to go home were not in place.\n\nSome 300 care home beds have been found that can be used on an interim basis.\n\nMr Yousaf said these would be in addition to the 600 interim beds that are already being used, with the government paying 25% over the national care home contract rate to secure the additional beds.\n\nThe health secretary admitted that care home beds would not be the first or even second choice of many patients or their families.\n\nBut he said he hoped the move would help to ease the \"unprecedented pressure\" on the NHS over the winter, with many hospitals already close to full capacity due in part to the large number of patients suffering from Covid, flu and Strep A.\n\nThe week ending 1 January saw more than 1,200 patients in hospital with Covid - up 15% from the previous week and double the number from four weeks ago - while flu admissions were \"around three times higher than emergency admissions due to Covid\", Mr Yousaf added.\n\nHe said: \"This measure will only be in place for a limited period of time to directly support our hospitals to deal with pressures at the front door.\n\n\"However, it will enable some people to move from an acute setting to a more appropriate community one, recognising the risk of prolonged stays in hospital.\"\n\nMr Yousaf told the Scottish Parliament that this was the most challenging winter the NHS in Scotland has ever faced, with the pressure set to continue in the coming weeks.\n\nHe added: \"We are ensuring all possible actions are being taken to support services, and the additional measures I have outlined today will help relieve some of the extreme pressure health boards are facing.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said more than 1,700 people were in hospital despite being medically well enough to go home\n\nNHS 24 is also taking forward plans to recruit about 200 new staff before the end of March, and guidance has been issued to all health boards making it clear that they can take any necessary steps to protect critical and life-saving care in their areas.\n\nThe announcement came the day after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that Scotland's hospitals are \"almost completely full\", with bed occupancy exceeding 95% last week.\n\nRCN Scotland director Colin Poolman said it was right for the Scottish government to work to reduce delayed discharges but to achieve this ministers needed to \"recognise and address the serious workforce shortages in Scotland's communities\".\n\nHe said: \"District nursing services play a key role in supporting people to return home from hospital, and in preventing hospital admissions in the first place, but the vacancy rate for district nursing has reached 16%.\"\n\nDonald MacAskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said care homes in some areas of the country would not have enough staff available to look after additional patients who are being discharged from hospitals.\n\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that one care home owner had told him that that 60% of his staff were off work through a combination of illness and child care needs because of the school strike.\n\nMr MacAskill added: \"The flexibility offered by this resource will enable some providers in some locations to make themselves available but it's not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution.\"\n\nThe biggest issue for hospitals just now is finding bed space to get new people in. That's because they can't get patients discharged when they no longer need the level of medical treatment that hospitals provide because of pressures in social care.\n\nHence the plan announced by the health secretary to find and fund an additional 300 beds in care homes. Patients will be moved there as an interim measure while they wait for packages of social care to be put in place. In the meantime it will create some capacity in hospitals.\n\nBut the concerns voiced by some providers is that even if they can find beds then they will struggle to get staff, with the workforce already short of district nurses and carers.\n\nIt is delayed discharge that is having the biggest impact on the numbers of people experiencing long waits in emergency departments.\n\nThere's been a seismic jump. At the start of 2016 just three patients waited more than 12 hours to be seen - compare that to the equivalent weekly figure for this year and it is more than 2,500.\n\nA&E doctors are constantly warning of \"inhumane conditions\" and patients dying while they wait in overcrowded, noisy, cluttered departments for help.\n\nFigures published earlier on Tuesday showed that 2,506 people waited more than 12 hours in emergency departments in the week ending 1 January - the highest ever figure.\n\nThat was up from 2,183 the previous week, which had also been a record high.\n\nDr Lailah Peel, deputy chair of BMA Scotland, warned at the weekend that patient safety was now \"at risk every day\" in A&E departments, and that Scotland's hospitals are \"not safe\" for patients.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives described the figures as \"truly terrifying\", and questioned why the government was devoting more time to debating independence in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon than it was to Mr Yousaf's statement on the NHS.\n\nThe party's health spokesman, Sandesh Gulhane, said: \"We heard nothing from Humza Yousaf over the festive period, only for him to hastily cobble together a statement today - shortly before another divisive debate on independence which is timetabled to last longer than this statement on healthcare.\n\n\"This is a national emergency. People are dying unnecessarily, our heroic NHS staff are overwhelmed and burning out.\n\n\"The crisis in our NHS should be a priority for this parliament, because it is a priority for the people of Scotland - and they will be appalled today.\"\n\nScottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the current crisis in Scotland's hospitals should have been predicted, and that fewer patients were being seen in A&E departments than before the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \"What is unprecedented is this government's failure. The health secretary has been warned about this crisis for well over a year, and he has failed to listen and act on solutions.\n\n\"This government failed to end delayed discharge, something they promised to do in 2015, and eight years on it's at record levels.\"",

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Business Secretary Grant Shapps: \"We are duty-bound to protect the lives... of the British people\"\n\nUnions have criticised a new bill aimed at enforcing minimum service levels for the public sector during strikes as \"undemocratic, unworkable and illegal\".\n\nUnder the proposals, some public sector workers would be required to work during a strike.\n\nThe business secretary said the aim was to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nBut unions have threatened legal action if the bill is passed, while Labour says they would repeal it if they win the next election.\n\nThe head of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said that if it became law the legislation would \"prolong disputes and poison industrial relations - leading to more frequent strikes\".\n\n\"This legislation would mean that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don't comply,\" he said.\n\n\"That's undemocratic, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal.\"\n\nThe new bill, published on Tuesday, comes amid a wave of industrial action across the public sector as workers seek pay increases in the face of the rising cost of living.\n\nLaws requiring a minimum level of service during strikes had already been promised for public transport as part of the Conservative's 2019 election manifesto. A bill was introduced to Parliament in October.\n\nThe government is now seeking to extend this requirement to five other areas - the NHS, education, fire and rescue, border security, and nuclear decommissioning.\n\nTo meet minimum staffing levels - which are still to be decided - employers would be able to issue a \"work notice\" to unions, setting out who is required to work during a strike.\n\nUnder the legislation there would be no automatic protection from unfair dismissal for an employee who is told to work under minimum service agreements but chooses to strike.\n\nHowever, Business Secretary Grant Shapps pushed back on the idea workers would be sacked.\n\n\"No one is talking about sacking nurses... nothing we are announcing today in this bill from the despatch box is about getting rid of nurses any more than any employment contract has to be followed,\" he told MPs.\n\nMr Shapps said the government \"absolutely believes in the right to strike\" but it is \"duty bound\" to protect the lives and livelihoods of the public.\n\n\"We don't want to use this legislation but we must ensure the safety of the British public,\" he said.\n\nMr Shapps said the proposed legislation was similar to existing laws in other modern European economies and it was not designed to ban strikes.\n\nHe accused unions representing ambulance workers of \"a lack of timely cooperation\", which he said meant employers could not reach a national agreement for minimum safety levels during recent strikes.\n\nHe said this made \"contingency planning almost impossible\" and put lives at risk.\n\nBut unions disputed his claims as \"completely false\", with Unite's Sharon Graham saying agreements had been negotiated with regional managers to take into account local circumstances.\n\nGMB said it was an \"extraordinary attack\" on ambulance workers, who had left picket lines to respond to urgent calls.\n\nDuring December's strikes Category 1 calls - classed as the most life-threatening situations, such as cardiac arrest - were responded to by an ambulance. This will also be the case for Wednesday's strikes.\n\nHowever, no blanket agreement has been reached on responding to Category 2 calls, which include strokes or major burns, with unions agreeing locally which calls within this category will be responded to.\n\nFire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack called the bill a \"shameful attack\" on democratic rights and key workers.\n\nUnite's Ms Graham described it as a \"dangerous gimmick from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis they have caused\".\n\nMick Lynch, head of the RMT transport union, said the \"draconian legislation\" sought to \"punish workers\" for demanding decent pay and working conditions.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it was \"utterly stupid\" and \"insulting\" for Mr Shapps to go from thanking nurses to proposing to sack them for striking.\n\n\"How can he seriously think that sacking thousands of key workers won't just plunge our public services further into crisis?\" she told the Commons.\n\n\"We all want minimum standards of safety, service and staffing. It is the ministers failing to provide it,\" she said, adding that the public was being put at risk every day by the crisis in the NHS and staff shortages.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Angela Rayner asks Grant Shapps about strikes in the public sector: \"Any chance of a deal this year?\"\n\nMPs will get a chance to debate the bill - which applies to England, Wales and Scotland - next week.\n\nAfter the bill makes it through the House of Commons, where the Conservatives have a sizeable majority, it is expected to face greater opposition in the House of Lords where the numbers are less favourable.\n\nAny legislation would not have an impact on strikes this month, which are still set to go ahead.\n\nAmbulance staff in England and Wales are preparing to walk out on Wednesday, while nurses in England are also set to strike next week.\n\nAre you taking part in the strikes?

            "section": "Entertainment & Arts",
            "content": "Prince Harry's memoir Spare went on sale early in some bookshops in Spain\n\nIt was billed as the publishing event of the year.\n\nBut the meticulously-laid PR strategy for the launch of Prince Harry's tell-all autobiography appeared to unravel on Thursday in the face of a newspaper leak, followed by its surprise sale by some Spanish booksellers.\n\nPlans for a tightly choreographed publicity push, which would have been months in the making and involved a series of TV interviews with the prince, looked to be in ruins.\n\nBut while the publishers of Spare had gone to great lengths to keep the book under wraps to maximise the impact of its release, it's unlikely this unanticipated publicity will hurt sales.\n\nPhilip Jones, editor of trade paper The Bookseller, tells BBC News he thinks the leaks are \"70% good\" for the book and its publisher, Penguin Random House.\n\n\"I think they will be a little bit annoyed it has come out before the book is released, but I'm sure they will be delighted it is dominating the headlines around the world at a time when they want to increase pent-up demand ahead of publication on Tuesday,\" he says.\n\nHarry has conducted a string of pre-recorded broadcast interviews to promote the book\n\nDespite the publisher's efforts to keep the book secure, many journalists were able to get hold of it on Thursday, after word got out that the Spanish edition had been put on sale early in some bookshops.\n\nThat came hot on the heels of a leak in the Guardian, which broke the news of Harry's allegation in the book of a physical altercation with his brother, Prince William.\n\nThe next 36 hours saw wall-to-wall coverage of Spare as news outlets digested and distributed the revelations contained in its 416 pages.\n\nMost industry figures doubt that sales will be harmed by the leaks.\n\n\"This probably won't make any difference - they're likely going to sell the same number of books,\" says Edward Coram James, reputation management expert and CEO of digital marketing agency Go Up. \"If anything, they might sell more because they've got an additional week of coverage.\"\n\nBut he adds: \"You wouldn't have wanted a leak like this too far in advance, because you want the book to be launched at the height of the hype. If this leak had happened three weeks ago, the news cycle would have moved on and this story would have been slightly old hat.\n\n\"I would say it has happened close enough to the scheduled launch that, actually, the hype will continue until the launch itself, so it won't lose momentum.\"\n\nPenguin had carefully co-ordinated its publicity campaign. The strategy was for Harry to conduct a string of broadcast interviews (at least four that we know about so far), which will air in the 48 hours before the book's release.\n\nThe publisher otherwise kept things under wraps. They avoided doing a newspaper serialisation deal, while deliveries to many bookshops were scheduled to arrive at the last minute.\n\nThe book's publication follows the release of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's Netflix series Harry & Meghan\n\nBut the number of people involved in the book's international production and distribution meant a leak was difficult to avoid. The Guardian, The Sun, The Telegraph, the BBC and Sky News were among the outlets which obtained the book en Espa\u00f1ol on Thursday and started ploughing through it.\n\n\"The net result has been that about every two or three hours, someone translates another chapter and then there's been another news dump of some new line,\" notes Neill Denny, joint editor of book trade news website BookBrunch. \"No publicity campaign can normally achieve that. It's almost worked better than a serialisation.\"\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the Spanish publisher, Plaza y Janes Editores (which belongs to Penguin Random House) expressed his frustration, telling Reuters: \"A very clear launch protocol was established and communicated to all customers so that the book would not be marketed before that date.\n\n\"Everything points to the fact that some customers have breached their commitment to the publisher and have put the book on sale before the agreed date.\"\n\nMr Denny dismisses any suggestion that the leak could have been co-ordinated for publicity. \"I think this is embarrassing for the publisher, because it shows they can't handle a massive worldwide release without it leaking,\" he says.\n\nHarry's memoir further exposes the strained relationship with his brother Prince William\n\nWhile the early revelations may not have been part of the original rollout plan, Mr Coram James points out: \"With PR strategies on big events like this, there is very often a half-expectation that something is going to go wrong. And so they will have prepared for this scenario, even though they won't have expected it.\"\n\nOne result of the leak, he suggests, has been that the broadcasters who had pre-recorded interviews with Harry have been rushing out more teaser clips, partly to make sure their exclusive isn't undermined.\n\n\"I think that will have been co-ordinated with Penguin and the Sussexes after the leak, and will be an attempt by all three parties to get a bit of control,\" Mr Coram James adds.\n\nHarry is due to be interviewed on ITV, CBS, Good Morning America and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the coming days. The clips released so far suggest Harry will be given a tough ride by some of the interviewers.\n\nUnder the original PR strategy, that would have created the appearance of Harry being held to account over the book's content, getting ahead of any potential criticism.\n\nBut instead, Mr Coram James says, the leak has led to an unplanned period of exposure for the Sussexes, creating a gap that has been filled by critics appearing on media outlets to condemn parts of the book's content.\n\n\"When you are doing a release like this, you want to make sure you are setting the terms,\" he says. \"When the book is leaked, all of a sudden the narrative escapes you.\"\n\nThe book has been written with prolific celebrity ghostwriter JR Moehringer\n\nSpare might have Harry's name on the cover, but it was written with JR Moehringer, a prolific ghostwriter of celebrity memoirs who made his name writing Andre Agassi's bombshell autobiography in 2009.\n\n\"The American publishers were very smart to get him in the room with Harry,\" says Mr Denny. \"I think if Harry had written the book himself, it would have been a bit blander. But I think this guy's pulled out and worked on these themes and made the book much more interesting.\"\n\nThe publication of Spare is part of a long-running effort by Harry to get his own narrative into the public domain. That started when he sat down, alongside wife Meghan, with Oprah Winfrey in 2021 for a tell-all interview.\n\nThe couple later signed a reported $100m (\u00a383m) deal with Netflix for a string of programmes including their recent six-part docuseries, as well as a reported $25m (\u00a321m) deal with Spotify for a podcast hosted by Meghan. Harry reportedly received a further $25m from Penguin for the rights to Spare.\n\nThe releases of all these products have been timed so they do not clash. The Spotify podcast ran from August to November, followed by the release of the Netflix series in December, now the publication of Spare in January.\n\n\"Had they dropped all of them at once, their market will have fragmented - some will have bought the book, some will have watched the series or listened to the podcast,\" says Mr Coram James. \"But it's not just about giving consideration to their various stakeholders and employers, it's also about, how do we keep ourselves at the top of the news cycle for as long as possible?\"\n\nMany bookshops are running promotions for the release of Spare\n\nSpare is currently number one on Amazon's pre-order chart, suggesting the publicity has been beneficial. \"It's great that people want people to buy a book early,\" says Mr Jones. \"January is a difficult time to sell books and this book is great for the industry.\"\n\nPrior to the publicity from the book's leak, Spare was at number four in Amazon's weekly non-fiction chart.\n\nAhead of Harry in Amazon's most sold list were Miriam Margolyes' autobiography and two cookery books, Pinch of Nom and Bored of Lunch: The Healthy Slow Cooker Book.\n\nUltimately, no matter how much interest there is in Harry, his toughest competition may come from a recipe for a 463-calorie Red Lentil Dal.",

One of the pillars of Andre's personality was his self-destructiveness, and I realised that I had been pushing away the idea that this could be an organic part of his nature.\"\n\nBut some of Mr Moehringer's insights into Mr Agassi and, now, the prince - both complicated men with vexed parental relationships - may have arisen from his own complicated relationship with his father.\n\nMr Moehringer's own 2005 autobiography on the subject, The Tender Bar, discussed his childhood in Long Island being raised by a single mother, and finding a father figure in his Uncle Charlie and a pack of barflies at the local watering hole.\n\nHis own father - a rock'n'roll DJ in the early days of FM radio - had abandoned the family.\n\n\"The radio provided this spotty access to him. So I was always trying to dial him in,\" he told NPR's Terry Gross. \"I didn't understand that he had a certain shift every day. So I'd sit out on the stoop. And I had this transistor radio. And I was turning the dial excruciatingly slowly, trying to find his voice.\"\n\nA 2021 film version of The Tender Bar produced by Mr Clooney cast Mr Affleck as the aforementioned Uncle Charlie.\n\nBefore turning to book forms, Mr Moehringer attended Yale, and then worked at the New York Times as a news assistant. That was followed by stints in Colorado and the Los Angeles Times, in 1994. In 2000, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his feature Crossing Over, about the tensions that arose when a ferry opened up in a small segregated community in Alabama.\n\nIn addition to the Tender Bar and his ghostwriting, he has also written a novel, Sutton, about bank robber Willie Sutton.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe best ghostwriters do not just write well, they are able to embody their subjects, without ever sounding like a stand-up doing an impression.\n\n\"He's the pinnacle,\" book agent Madeleine Morel told the Observer. \"I'm sure everybody aspires to be him. He's such a brilliant writer. It's very hard to ghostwrite a book and at some level never have it sound like it was written by somebody else.\"\n\nBut being among the creme de la creme of ghostwriters often means deliberately flying under the radar.\n\nAround the release of Mr Agassi's Open in 2009, he told the New York Times: \"The midwife doesn't go home with the baby.\"",
