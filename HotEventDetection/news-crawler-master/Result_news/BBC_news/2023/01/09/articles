            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Rishi Sunak refuses to to say if he is registered with private GP\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it is \"not really relevant\".\n\nMr Sunak told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was \"a personal choice\".\n\nNursing union leader Pat Cullen said the PM \"needed to come clean as a public servant\".\n\nAnd when asked the same question, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he did not use private healthcare.\n\nIn the interview, Laura Kuenssberg suggested there was huge public interest in Mr Sunak's decisions and that former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher was open about her choice to use a private GP.\n\nMr Sunak said healthcare was \"something that is private\", adding he \"grew up in an NHS family\", with a dad who was GP, and a mum who was a pharmacist.\n\nBut when pressed again, Mr Sunak did not answer the question and instead said, in general, \"we should be making use of the independent sector\" so patients could choose where they have treatment.\n\nA newspaper report in November last year suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and charges \u00a3250 for a half-hour consultation.\n\nThe latest NHS figures show that, in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment.\n\nAt the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment, as the NHS faces one of the worst winters in its history.\n\nMs Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said public servants \"ought to be clear with the public whether or not you are using private health cover\".\n\n\"That's about being open, it's about being transparent and it's about honesty,\" she said.\n\nMr Streeting said the PM's answer to the question about his healthcare showed him to be someone who did not understand the biggest crisis in NHS history.\n\nHe said private healthcare created a two-tier system, but patients were free to make their own choices about treatment.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: PM gives impression that he doesn't use NHS - Wes Streeting\n\nMr Sunak has said he has a policy of not commenting on his family's healthcare arrangements, when asked previously.\n\nLaura Kuenssberg said there was likely to be a political row over Mr Sunak's personal healthcare choices.\n\nOne former minister told the BBC presenter: \"[Mr Sunak's] lack of transparency shows he thinks going private is a problem. It is - he's taking decisions on public spend that affect a version of 'the public' that he's not willing to be part of.\"\n\nSome of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister.\n\nDavid Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid.\n\nBut when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to \"go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want\".\n\nThe prime minister says how he arranges his personal life should not matter, what's important is how his government manages the NHS. Many would agree.\n\nBut refusing to be transparent leaves him politically vulnerable.\n\nFirst there's the charge, already levelled, that he's not being open and honest about his arrangements. That's damaging in itself.\n\nSecond, some may infer that perhaps the prime minister does have private healthcare but doesn't want to admit it. If so, perhaps he's worried about giving any impression that he may think NHS is not good enough for him and his family.\n\nAnd perhaps what could be most harmful is the perception that leaves. When the NHS is under enormous stress, is Mr Sunak distanced from the reality of the service most are using?\n\nMr Sunak was interviewed as senior doctors warn of a NHS on a knife edge, with health workers striking over pay and some hospitals in crisis.\n\nA sharp rise in Covid-19 and flu admissions in recent weeks has put pressure on hospitals, which are also dealing with a backlog of treatment that built up during the pandemic.\n\nA&E waits and ambulance delays are at their worst levels on record.\n\nIn Sunday's interview, Mr Sunak acknowledged the NHS was \"undeniably under enormous pressure\".\n\nWhen asked if the NHS was \"in crisis\", he said while recovering from the pandemic \"was going to be tough\", he was optimistic \"we can get to grips with this problem\".\n\nIn his new year speech this week, Mr Sunak said bringing down NHS waiting lists was one of his five top priorities and has since held talks with health leaders to alleviate the crisis.",

            "content": "Piotr Krowka's body was found in a former parochial house in Maghera in 2018\n\nTwo men have been jailed for the \"brutal\" killing of a homeless man in County Londonderry.\n\nThe body of Piotra Krowka, 37, was found at a derelict parochial house in Glen Road, Maghera, in 2018.\n\nCaolan Michael Johnston, 21, from The Fort, Maghera, and Adrian Kozak, 22, from Garvey Wood, Ballymena, previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nKozak was sentenced to eight years and Johnston was handed a six-year sentence.\n\nBoth will serve half the terms in jail and half on licence.\n\nKozak, from Garvey Wood, Ballymena, was 17 at the time of the killing and was also involved in previous attacks on Mr Krowka prior to the fatal assault.\n\nJohnston, from The Fort in Maghera, was aged 16 at the time and described as easily led.\n\nThe court was told that Mr Krowka - who was originally from Poland - was left to die after being attacked by Johnston and Kozak on 31 March 2018.\n\nIt happened in a derelict former parochial house where Mr Krowka was sleeping rough.\n\nThe men went back to the scene twice on the day after the attack, but did not raise the alarm.\n\nA post-mortem examination revealed that he had suffered a violent death, caused by blunt-force trauma to his head, chest, abdomen and left arm.\n\nJudge Patricia Smyth described the attack as sustained and brutal, causing catastrophic injuries.\n\nAt Belfast Crown Court on Monday, she said the case had been \"exceptionally difficult\".\n\nThe Belfast Recorder spoke about both Kozak and Johnston's youth and immaturity in March 2018 and said she accepted that neither young men intended to cause Mr Krowka serious harm.\n\nMr Krowka had been living with fellow Poles in Maghera but found himself homeless following allegations that he had sexually assaulted a woman.\n\nThis resulted in him being attacked on several occasions prior to the fatal beating carried out in the disused property.\n\nBoth men were initially charged with murder before they pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nAs she sentenced them, Judge Smyth said the injuries sustained by Mr Krowka were \"catastrophic\".\n\n\"A vulnerable man was left to die, having been subjected to a brutal and sustained beating by two teenagers who did not intend to cause him really serious harm, and who - due to their age, relative immaturity, lighting conditions within a derelict house and a degree of panic - failed to appreciate the extent of his injuries or the fact he was in a life-threatening condition.\"\n\nAs their families sat in the public gallery, both young men were led from the dock in handcuffs by prison staff and taken into custody to begin their sentences.",

            "section": null,
            "content": "Last updated on .From the section FA Cup\n\nLeague Two Stevenage produced an incredible late comeback to stun Premier League Aston Villa at Villa Park and reach the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nThe visiting players and manager Steve Evans celebrated with their supporters at full-time after two goals in the final two minutes clinched a magnificent victory.\n\nSubstitute Dean Campbell fired in a superb 90th-minute winner after Jamie Reid's equaliser from the penalty spot - the spot-kick awarded after last man Leander Dendoncker was shown a straight red card for bringing down Campbell.\n\nMorgan Sanson's first goal for Villa had given Unai Emery's side a half-time lead over a side ranked 59 places below them in the football pyramid.\n\nBut the hosts, despite their overall superiority, were unable to extend their advantage and they were made to pay in a remarkable conclusion to the match.\n\nFourth tier Stevenage's reward is a trip to Championship outfit Stoke City in the fourth round, which takes place from 27 to 30 January.\n\nFor 84 minutes, it all appeared rather straightforward for Aston Villa.\n\nBut their bid to end their worst ever FA Cup losing run - which extends to an eighth match - unravelled from the moment Dendoncker was dispossessed on the edge of his own box and grabbed the shirt of Campbell.\n\nReferee Graham Scott appeared to initially award a free-kick but then produced a red card and pointed to the spot, allowing a video assistant referee review to confirm the penalty.\n\nReid held his nerve to send Robin Olsen the wrong way and put Stevenage on course for a replay - a feat which would have been a fantastic achievement on its own.\n\nBut the League Two side were not done yet and some quick thinking from Jake Reeves to pass his corner to Campbell resulted in the 21-year-old Scot drilling a shot into the bottom corner and sending the away fans into raptures.\n\nVilla have now progressed from just one FA Cup tie since reaching the 2015 final. Stevenage, meanwhile, are the first fourth tier side to beat a Premier League team in an away FA Cup tie for four years.\n\nA manager with a rich history in cup competitions, four-time Europa League winner Emery made his intentions clear this week as he announced he was preparing his side for this match with the objective of \"winning the FA Cup\".\n\nFive years after he joined Barcelona in a \u00a3142m move from Liverpool in January 2018, Brazilian Philippe Coutinho started among eight changes from Villa's midweek Premier League draw with Wolves.\n\nThe hosts dictated from the start - they ended the match having averaged 78.6% possession - but Douglas Luiz's long-range effort was the only test for goalkeeper Taye Ashby-Hammond before Stevenage offered their first warning.\n\nLuke Norris was unlucky to marginally mistime his run before he provided a great assist to set up Danny Rose for what the visitors momentarily believed was a shock opener.\n\nAn intricate passing move produced Villa's opener, Ings teeing up Frenchman Sanson for his first goal for the club, but Stevenage stuck to their task and almost had a stunning equaliser when Norris skimmed the top of the crossbar with an excellent curled attempt.\n\nThey continued to defend resolutely as Villa increased the pressure after the break.\n\nPerhaps too keen to impress in his first start under Emery, the misfiring Coutinho left the field after 65 minutes, having had a match-leading five attempts but landing just one on target.\n\nThere had been little to suggest the match would end as it did. After all, Stevenage scored with their only two shots on target. But what unfolded will live long in the memory of the 3,000 travelling fans present to witness a truly memorable fightback.\n\u2022 None Offside, Stevenage. Michael Bostwick tries a through ball, but Jordan Roberts is caught offside.\n\u2022 None Attempt blocked. David Amoo (Stevenage) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked.

            "section": "Latin America & Caribbean",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has vowed to punish supporters of the country's ex-leader, Jair Bolsonaro, after they stormed Congress.\n\nSupporters of the ousted far-right leader also stormed the Supreme Court and surrounded the presidential palace.\n\nBut police regained control of the buildings in the capital Brasilia on Sunday evening after hours of clashes.\n\nBrasilia's Civil Police said 300 people have been arrested and officials have vowed to track down others involved.\n\nThe justice minister, Flavio Dino, has said the government is seeking information on \"terrorist attacks\".\n\nOn Monday morning, heavily armed officers in the city gathered outside a camp of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters - one of a number that have been set up outside army barracks around the country since October's election.\n\nMeanwhile, Brasilia's governor, Ibaneis Rocha, has been removed from his post for 90 days by the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Alexandre de Moraes accused him of failing to prevent the riot and of being \"painfully silent\" in the face of the attack. Mr Rocha has apologised for Sunday's events.\n\nPro-democracy rallies are being called by leftist leaders and groups across Brazil.\n\nThe dramatic scenes - which saw thousands of protesters clad in yellow Brazil football shirts and flags overrun police and ransack the heart of the Brazilian state - come just a week after Lula's inauguration.\n\nHe toured the Supreme Court building on Sunday night to see the damage for himself.\n\nThe veteran left-wing leader was forced to declare emergency powers before dispatching the national guard into the capital to restore order.\n\nHe also ordered the closure of the centre of the capital - including the main avenue where governmental buildings are - for 24 hours.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Brazilian President Lula says Congress invaders will be punished\n\nMr Dino said some 40 buses which had been used to transport protesters to the capital had been seized and he called the invasion an \"absurd attempt to impose [the protesters'] will by force\".\n\nMr Bolsonaro has repeatedly refused to accept that he lost October's election and last week left the country instead of taking part in inaugural ceremonies, which would have seen him hand over the iconic presidential sash.\n\nThe 67-year-old - who is believed to be in Florida - condemned the attack and denied responsibility for encouraging the rioters in a post on Twitter some six hours after violence broke out.\n\nSpeaking before he arrived in Brasilia, Lula said there was \"no precedent in the history of our country\" for the scenes in Brasilia and called the violence the \"acts of vandals and fascists\".\n\nAnd he took aim at security forces whom he accused of \"incompetence, bad faith or malice\" for failing to stop demonstrators accessing Congress.\n\n\"You will see in the images that they [police officers] are guiding people on the walk to Praca dos Tres Powers,\" he said. \"We are going to find out who the financiers of these vandals who went to Brasilia are and they will all pay with the force of law.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Brazilian outlet O Globo showed some officers laughing and taking photos together as demonstrators occupied the congressional campus in the background.\n\nSome protesters smashed windows, while others reached the Senate chamber, where they jumped on to seats and used benches as slides.\n\nVideos on social media show protesters pulling a police officer from his horse and attacking him outside the building.\n\nFootage broadcast by national media show police detaining dozens of protesters in their yellow jerseys outside the presidential palace.\n\nOther suspects - whose hands were bound behind their backs - are also seen being led out of the building.\n\nProtesters had been gathering since the morning on the lawns in front of the parliament and up and down the kilometre of the Esplanada avenue, which is lined with government ministries and national monuments.\n\nDespite the actions of the protesters, in the hours before the chaos, security had appeared tight, with the roads closed for about a block around the parliament area and armed police pairs guarding every entrance into the area.\n\nThe BBC had seen about 50 police officers around on Sunday morning local time and cars were turned away at entry points, while those entering on foot were frisked by police checking bags.\n\nDemonstrators were quick to defend their actions when approached by reporters.\n\nLima, a 27-year-old production engineer, said: \"We need to re-establish order after this fraudulent election.\"\n\n\"I'm here for history, for my daughters,\" she told AFP news agency.\n\nOthers in the capital expressed outrage at the violence and said the attack marked a sad day for the country.\n\n\"I voted for Bolsanaro but I don't agree with what they're doing,\" Daniel Lacerda, 21, told the BBC. \"If you don't agree with the president you should just say it and move on, you shouldn't go hold protests and commit all the violence like they're doing.\"\n\nAnd many are drawing comparisons with the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by supporters of Donald Trump, an ally of Mr Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro supporters vandalising the interior of the presidential palace\n\nBolsonaro supporters created camps in cities across Brazil, some of them outside the military barracks. That is because his most ardent supporters want the military to intervene and make good elections that they say were stolen.\n\nIt looked like their movement had been curbed by Lula's inauguration - the camps in Brasilia had been dismantled and there was no disruption on the day he was sworn in.\n\nBut Sunday's scenes show that those predictions were premature.\n\nAccording to Katy Watson, the BBC's South America correspondent, some protesters aren't just angry that Jair Bolsonaro lost the election - they want President Lula to return to prison.\n\nHe spent 18 months in jail after being found guilty of corruption in 2017. His convictions were later annulled, after initially being sentenced to more than nine years.\n\nPolice used tear gas in an attempt to repel protesters\n\nLeaders from Latin America have condemned the violence. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said \"fascism [had] decided to stage a coup\" while Colombia and Mexico have offered their full support to President Lula.\n\nThese sentiments have been echoed in other countries. US President Joe Biden said he condemned \"the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil\", while Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the \"attack on democracy...cannot be tolerated\".\n\nThe UK, China and Turkey are among other countries that have also condemned the rioters' actions.",

Dr Lailah Peel says patient safety is \"at risk every day\" in A&E departments\n\nScotland's hospitals are \"not safe\" for patients under current winter pressures on the NHS, a doctors' union says.\n\nDr Lailah Peel, deputy chair of BMA Scotland, said patient safety was now \"at risk every day\" in A&E departments.\n\nShe spoke to BBC Scotland as Covid cases soared last week and hospital flu admissions hit a five-year high.\n\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government was doing \"everything possible\" in its power to improve the situation.\n\nDr Peel said a major problem was the shortage of beds due to delayed discharge - where patients who are medically fit are unable to leave hospital, often due to a lack of community care provision.\n\nShe told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show: \"It's absolutely heartbreaking, because as a doctor you know what you want to do for patients in their hour of need, but you just can't because you've got so many other patients.\n\n\"Patients who need to be in intensive care or high dependency units are sitting in A&E departments for hours waiting, it is just not safe.\n\n\"Patient safety is at risk every day in our A&Es across Scotland. You just can't give the care you want to give to patients.\"\n\nCovid cases have soared and hospital flu admissions have reached a five-year high\n\nDr Peel said many doctors and medical staff had reached their limit, which was adding to the pressure on health services.\n\nShe added: \"We've struggled for the last three years, it is absolutely brutal. It is painful to think about the future because we can't see this improving any time soon.\n\n\"You see more and more colleagues not turning up to work because they are just broken. More are looking at careers outside of medicine, because it's just so difficult every day.\"\n\nOn Friday Nicola Sturgeon chaired a meeting of the Scottish government's resilience committee to address the pressures on health and social care services.\n\nThe first minister and key cabinet ministers met NHS board chiefs, local authorities and the Scottish Ambulance Service.\n\nThe committee, which included Scotland's Health secretary Humza Yousaf, discussed the Covid-19 situation, the flu outbreak and increased demands on acute sites and social care over winter.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Humza Yousaf says there is an unprecedented crisis in the NHS this winter\n\nMr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that he was doing everything possible to help move fit patients into community care.\n\nHe said about 95% of patients were discharged on time, but the remaining percentage was creating \"a real issue for capacity within hospitals\".\n\n\"Doctors and nurses are working under the most unprecedented pressure of their careers and the NHS's existence,\" he said.\n\n\"People are not getting the level of care I would want, for myself or a family member.\n\n\"Our focus is on trying to invest more in social care, to improve conditions for the workforce and to try to create every ounce of capacity we possible can.\"\n\nMr Yousaf insisted that the Scottish government had done enough planning for this winter, but said there was not a \"silver bullet\" that could alleviate current pressures.\n\nHe added: \"Even with all the mitigation, if we are going to face high levels of Covid, high levels of flu, Strep A and other viral infections, and high energy costs and inflation.\n\n\"We planned for this winter as soon as last winter was over, we got right into meetings. There are some things we just could not have foreseen.\"\n\nHow are your local NHS services coping this winter? Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments, for example, those who attend minor injury units. Each nation has different target times for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them may not be possible. A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.\n\nSeveral of Scotland's A&E departments have asked for emergency measures to be brought in after concerns about patient safety and \"inhumane\" conditions due to high occupancy.\n\nOn Friday, NHS Borders said Borders General Hospital was at capacity and paused all routine operations.\n\nThe health board said the situation was due to high staff absence from illness and the closure of wards due to Covid, flu and Norovirus outbreaks.\n\nScottish Labour last week called for the Army to be drafted in to help.\n\nThe Scottish government previously called in soldiers to drive ambulances in 2021 during the Covid pandemic.\n\nMr Yousaf said the Army would not solve the situation, but said he would look at any request from health boards.\n\n\"The biggest issue we are facing is the high level of delayed discharge. Drafting in the army is not going to help,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he had \"no objection\" to any health board declaring a major incident, but said it wouldn't guarantee mutual aid from other boards as all were under pressure.\n\nThe latest figures for A&E departments showed a record 1,925 Scots spent 12 hours or more waiting in the week leading up to Christmas.\n\nThere have also been reports of lengthy waits to get through to helpline NHS 24 and difficulties getting a GP appointment.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said Mr Yousaf's planning for winter \"came too little too late\".\n\nHealth spokesman, Dr Sandesh Gulhane MSP, said: \"He was repeatedly warned a year ago that a winter crisis was looming but he totally failed to act.\n\n\"His flimsy NHS Recovery plan which is now well over a year old is simply not fit for purpose. He is offering no solutions to this crisis.\"",

which include planned walkouts by ambulance drivers, bus drivers, teachers and driving examiners - are all expected to go ahead.\n\nNurses in England are also set to walk out for two days next week.\n\nElaine Sparkes, from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said the talks were \"more constructive\" than previous meetings but \"there is nothing tangible on the table\" and the union would announce strike dates later this week.\n\nWatch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.\n\nA government source said the health secretary discussed productivity and efficiency savings which would help decide what was affordable for the coming year's pay deal.\n\nA one-off payment for health service staff was mentioned in passing, the source said.\n\nUnions have repeatedly called for a better pay offer to be on the table before April and are said to have asked Mr Barclay to make that case to the chancellor.\n\nThe source said Mr Barclay had agreed to look at their request, without making any commitments.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nEarlier, there were also meetings between Education Secretary Gillian Keegan and teaching unions.\n\nFollowing the talks, Kevin Courtney, from the National Education Union (NEU), said \"no concrete progress\" was made and there was no new pay offer.\n\n\"There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action,\" he said.\n\nHowever, in a statement he later said there was a promise of further discussions on changes to pay for this year.\n\nTeaching unions covering England and Wales, including the NEU, the NAHT and the NASUWT, are currently balloting members on potential strike action.\n\nIn Scotland, teachers are striking for two days this week, with a week-long industrial action planned for next week.\n\nThe day of talks come as a ballot opens for junior doctors in England to decide on their own industrial action, which could begin in March.\n\nAre you taking part in the strikes?

On Christmas Eve, a senior health official in the port city of Qingdao reported that half a million people were being infected each day. Those case figures were swiftly removed from news reports.\n\nMeanwhile Chinese health officials said they would not include Pfizer's antiviral Covid medicine Paxlovid in its basic medical insurance schemes as a result of the high price quoted by the US firm.\n\nThe drug, temporarily covered by China's broad healthcare insurance scheme until 31 March, has seen a sharp increase in demand since China's Covid cases surged last month.\n\nPfizer would continue to collaborate with the Chinese government and all relevant stakeholders to \"secure and adequate supply\" of the medicine in China, the company said in a statement.\n\nOn Sunday, Beijing also lifted mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals and opened its border with Hong Kong.\n\nIn the first wave of pre-holiday travel, official data showed that 34.7 million people travelled domestically on Saturday. This represented an increase of more than a third compared to last year, according to state media.\n\nInfections are expected to soar as the country celebrates Lunar New Year later this month, with millions expected to travel from big cities to visit older relatives in the countryside.\n\nOverall, more than two billion individual journeys are expected to take place, officials have said.\n\nListen to more on what we know about China's Covid numbers: More or Less- Behind the Stats - Can China's data on Covid deaths be trusted- on BBC Sounds",

            "content": "Just one week after the inauguration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil, thousands of supporters of the previous incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the country's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace.\n\nThe president said security forces in the capital, Bras\u00edlia didn't do enough to stop them. We've looked into the key moments and how the police responded.\n\nSince the narrow election win in October by the left-wing president, better known as Lula, supporters of his right-wing rival had been setting up camps in front of military barracks in many cities around the country.\n\nHis most ardent supporters have been calling for the army to intervene and overturn the election result.\n\nThen over the weekend, thousands of people gathered outside the army barracks in Bras\u00edlia, many of them brought in by bus.\n\nPresident Lula called on local security forces to remove these protesters, but police had opted to not use force.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the protesters set off on a march towards the complex of government buildings. Video footage shows the march peacefully under way, with military police escorting them along the 7km (four mile) route.\n\nWe have asked the police authorities in Bras\u00edlia whether the protesters had been granted official permission to march along this route ahead of time. We haven't yet received a response.\n\nThe protesters arrived at barriers blocking access to the complex of government buildings known as \"Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes\" (Three Powers Square).\n\nA video verified by the BBC shows only a single line of metal barriers across a road through a relatively open area.\n\nOne of the policemen can be seen pulling out what appears to be pepper spray or tear gas, aiming it at the protesters, who quickly force their way through.\n\nWe have asked the police why they hadn't organised stronger barriers and mobilised more officers to control the situation once the protesters approached the government square.\n\nOnce the barriers had been breached, crowds flooded onto ramps which led to the Congress building and the presidential palace.\n\nPolice have been criticised for being too hands-off with the protesters as they streamed in.\n\nTwo videos we've verified shows policemen taking pictures of the crowds as they walk up the ramps and into the Congress building.\n\nAnother video shows a policeman being pulled from his horse by protesters as they approach the Congress building and thrown to the ground.\n\nThe National Congress and the presidential palace were breached just before 15:00 local time.\n\nVideos show protesters using security barricades to smash through several large windows before entering, spreading throughout both buildings and onto the roof of Congress.\n\nThe BBC has also verified this video which shows police standing by as protesters walk up a staircase into the Congress building through the lower floor entrance.\n\nPolice holding riot shields are standing on the right of the stairs, but they aren't protecting the main entrance and appear to be guarding a side corridor instead.\n\nOne policeman waves the protesters through and gives them a thumbs up. As the crowd move forward into the building, some of them applaud the security personnel.\n\nFrom the police uniforms seen in the video it looks like they are part of the Policia Legislativa, the Federal police group that works inside Congress.\n\nShortly afterwards, a group also smashed windows of the Supreme Court and entered the building.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nImages show that once inside the buildings, protesters destroyed furniture, equipment and works of art.\n\nSocial media posts from the afternoon of 8 January clearly show scores of protestors both outside in the plaza and milling around inside buildings, in some cases with no police or security forces visible.\n\nVideos circulating online showed protesters trashing offices, smashing windows and doors, flipping furniture, and tossing computers and printers to the ground.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nThe governor of Bras\u00edlia, Ibaneis Rocha, eventually requested support from the national government - although it's not clear when exactly this was made.\n\nPresident Lula announced soon afterwards that he had authorised national forces to intervene in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nEven with the involvement of additional forces, it took many more hours to bring the situation under control. The Supreme Court was the first to be cleared. Then, as more forces arrived, other buildings were also gradually emptied.",

            "content": "Singer Sean Cooney has written the song Doctor Boro about Dr Iftikhar Lone\n\nDown the centuries, folk singers have immortalised the lives of everyday characters, from sailors to scoundrels to working-class heroes.\n\nNow, a new set of folk heroes have had their stories sung by modern musicians.\n\nThey include a long-serving GP who almost died of Covid, a soup kitchen manager, and a woman who set up a charity in memory of her late daughter.\n\nSongs about them by artists like Chris Difford and Thea Gilmore feature in BBC Radio 2's 21st Century Folk project.\n\nAll five people who feature in the new songs are from the north-east of England.\n\nThey include Dr Iftikhar Lone, who has been a GP in Middlesbrough for 44 years and was in charge of the Covid vaccine rollout in his area.\n\nHowever, he spent nine days in intensive care after catching the virus himself in 2020.\n\nWarning: Third party content may contain adverts\n\n\"When I got Covid in the very first wave when there was no treatment, I was nine days in ICU then another seven days in hospital before I came out, after losing 16lb in weight and lucky to be alive,\" the 75-year-old says.\n\n\"I do not know what the cost of that treatment was. You go in, get treatment, you come out, and you don't worry about the cost. And I think that's a great thing. So therefore the song says, 'Free NHS for all.'\"\n\nSean Cooney of Stockton-on-Tees band The Young'uns has turned Dr Lone's story into a song called Doctor Boro, combining his passions for the NHS and Middlesbrough FC.\n\nDr Lone adds: \"I was surprised that he covered everything that we talked about. He really captured everything in it.\"\n\nMartyn Joseph has written about Andrea Bell, who helps run Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen\n\nOnly one thing in the song didn't really happen, he points out. When he met the Queen to get an MBE in 2006, her handbag didn't actually bear the letters UTB - short for the football slogan Up The Boro.\n\nCooney says being paired with Dr Lone \"was tremendously good fun\".\n\n\"He's quite a character and he's got a dry sense of humour, and half the time you're not quite sure if he's joking or not,\" he says. \"I don't know what his patients think!\"\n\nBut capturing the doctor's life in a song presented \"a challenge\" about how to combine healthcare and football.\n\nThen \"suddenly something clicked\", he says. \"I thought, let's create a character for him. Let's marry those two things immediately in the title and in the character and let's call it Doctor Boro.\"\n\nKathryn Williams and Chris Difford dedicated their song to foyboatman Michael Dodds (centre)\n\nCooney believes the resulting song is \"very current and very resonant\".\n\n\"Dr Lone talks about the huge crisis that the NHS is under at the minute, and there's a line in the song where I say, 'Summer's turned to winter.'\n\n\"That reflected what he told me in his office in September - it's like a winter crisis, but it's happening all year round.\"\n\nThe 21st Century Folk project is intended as a modern version of the BBC's groundbreaking Radio Ballads, in which folk singer Ewan MacColl wrote about ordinary British people in the late 1950s and early '60s.\n\nThe new versions will be featured on the Radio 2 Folk Show with Mark Radcliffe on Wednesday.",

            "section": "Science & Environment",
            "content": "The jumbo will carry the rocket to 35,000ft\n\nThe first ever orbital space launch from British soil is getting ready to blast off.\n\nMonday's mission will see a repurposed 747 jumbo jet release a rocket over the Atlantic to take nine satellites high above the Earth.\n\nNewquay Airport in Cornwall is the starting point for the operation, on Monday evening after 2100 GMT.\n\nIf it succeeds, it will be a major milestone for UK space, marking the birth of a home-grown launch industry.\n\n\"What we've seen over the last eight years is this building of excitement towards something very aspirational and different for Cornwall, something that started off as a project that not a lot of people really believed was ever going to happen,\" said Melissa Thorpe, who heads up Spaceport Cornwall.\n\n\"What I think people have seen here in Cornwall is a small team that lives and breathes this county deliver something quite incredible.\"\n\nAircraft and shipping have been told to stay out of the launch zone\n\nThis first foray into orbital launch from UK territory is actually using an American company, Virgin Orbit, that was founded by Sir Richard Branson.\n\nThe British entrepreneur has had one of his old passenger airliners converted to carry a rocket, called LauncherOne, underneath its left wing.\n\nWhen the 747 leaves Newquay, it will head west out over the Atlantic to a designated launch zone just off the coast of the Irish counties of Kerry and Cork.\n\nAt the appropriate moment and at an altitude of 35,000ft, the Virgin jet will release the rocket, which will then ignite its first-stage engine to begin the climb to orbit.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. WATCH: The BBC got an exclusive look inside Virgin Orbit's Cosmic Girl aeroplane\n\nThe BBC was given a rare chance to look inside Virgin Orbit's carrier plane, nicknamed Cosmic Girl.\n\nOn the lower deck, everything has been stripped out to save weight, because a fully fuelled rocket is a heavy load.\n\nUpstairs, two flight engineers will sit at consoles to monitor the launch. The cockpit, though, remains largely unchanged, apart from the addition of a small red button that, when pressed, will release the rocket.\n\nMathew \"Stanny\" Stannard, an RAF squadron leader, is on secondment to Virgin Orbit, and will be the lead pilot, sitting in the left seat.\n\n\"We'll be monitoring the rocket, making sure it's healthy all the way out,\" he explained.\n\n\"And then we enter what's called a terminal count procedure. That's where things for us certainly get more interesting as we go through that sequence of pressurising the tank and chilling the lines.\n\n\"And at the end of that terminal count, it's my job to make sure the aeroplane is at the right bit in the sky, in the right position, so when the rocket says 'I'm ready to go', away she goes.\"\n\nTwo of the satellites, called Prometheus-2, will test novel radio and imaging technologies\n\nTo date, Virgin Orbit, which is based in Long Beach, California, has carried out four straight successful rocket launches over the Pacific Ocean. The flights were initiated from the Mojave Air and Space Port, north of Los Angeles,\n\nFor the UK mission, the team has decamped to Cornwall to set up a new mission control.\n\nDeenah Sanchez, the launch director, says it will be a complex operation.\n\n\"We basically have three different launch systems out there,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"We have our ground hardware, we have an entire aeroplane, and a rocket, and so we have people that specialise in each area here in the control room.\"\n\nVirgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart joked that apart from the Cornish pasties versus American hamburgers, there wasn't a great deal of difference in how his team would operate for the UK flight. \"[It's] a little different weather than Mojave, but otherwise the team is turning the wrenches in the same way,\" he said.\n\nA corner of Newquay Airport has been given over to Spaceport Cornwall activities\n\nIf the launch goes to plan, nine small satellites will be released into an orbit more than 500km above the planet.\n\nThey have a mix of civil and military applications, ranging from ocean monitoring to navigation technology.\n\nOne of the shoe-box sized satellites belongs to Cardiff-based company Space Forge. The firm wants to use satellites to make novel, high-value materials and components in space.\n\nJosh Western, CEO of Space Forge, said: \"For the first time, the UK has all the pieces of the jigsaw to be able to design and develop satellites, launch them from the UK and operate them from the UK.\"\n\nThere is a lot of hope riding on this rocket and its mission is just the beginning of the UK's future strategy for space.\n\nAlongside a growing satellite industry, Scottish companies Skyrora and Orbex are leading the way in building more traditional vertical launch systems - rockets that go straight up from the ground.\n\nThese vehicles will operate from Shetland and Sutherland in the far north of the country, possibly by the end of 2023.\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "Prince Harry has ruled out a return to the UK as a working royal\n\nPrincess Diana would have been \"heartbroken\" about the conflict with his brother Prince William, Prince Harry has told a US television interview.\n\nHe told Good Morning America their mother would have been saddened at the arguments, which he said were fuelled by briefings to a divisive press.\n\nPrince Harry said there had to be \"accountability\" before reconciliation.\n\nHe also ruled out a return to the UK as a working royal.\n\nPrince Harry told ABC News TV interviewer Michael Strahan a return to such a life within the Royal Family in the UK would be \"unsurvivable\".\n\n\"That's really sad, because that's essentially breaking the relationship between us,\" said Prince Harry, in an interview about his memoir, Spare.\n\nIn the book Prince Harry speaks about the traumatic legacy of his mother's death in a car accident in 1997 - but says Diana would now be sad to see the dispute between her sons, with Prince Harry seeing William as his \"arch nemesis\" as well as \"beloved brother\" and describing a physical altercation between them.\n\n\"I think she would be looking at it long term to know that there are certain things that we need to go through to be able to heal the relationship,\" he said in the interview.\n\nHe also spoke about his relationship with Camilla, the Queen Consort, saying they hadn't spoken for a long time, but he didn't think of her as an \"evil stepmother\".\n\nPrince Harry said he had compassion for her as the \"third person within my parents' marriage\".\n\nIt was soon presented as \"Meghan versus Kate\", says Prince Harry about the sisters-in-law\n\n\"She had a reputation and an image to rehabilitate. And whatever conversations happened, whatever deals or trading was made right at the beginning, she was led to believe that would be the best way of doing it,\" he told the US news show.\n\nThese claims, presenting Prince Harry's view of events, have so far not drawn a response from Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace.\n\nIn an ITV interview on Sunday, Prince Harry had accused the Royal Family of failing to defend his wife Meghan - with overnight viewing figures showing it had been seen by an audience of 4.1 million viewers, behind Call the Midwife and Happy Valley which drew over 5 million that evening.\n\nPrince Harry highlighted the controversy over a Jeremy Clarkson newspaper column, saying the \"silence is deafening\" from the Royal Family about what he called the \"horrific\" Sun article.\n\nHe contrasted this with the quick action taken after a race row at a Buckingham Palace reception.\n\nThe Clarkson article about Meghan had described how the columnist was \"dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her\".\n\nLater taken down by the Sun and prompting an apology from the paper and Mr Clarkson, the article was described by Prince Harry as \"horrific and hurtful and cruel towards my wife\".\n\n\"The world is asking for some form of comment from the monarchy. But the silence is deafening. To put it mildly,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything to do with my wife, after six years, they haven't said a single thing.\n\nHe also said he believed that stereotyping about Meghan - as an \"American actress, divorced, biracial\" - had been a barrier to Prince William and Catherine \"welcoming her in\" to the family.\n\n\"Very quickly it became Meghan versus Kate,\" he said of how the relationship was presented in the media, also saying it was fair to say \"almost from the get-go\" that the sisters-in-law did not \"get on\".\n\nPrince Harry accused the Royal Family of \"getting into bed with the devil\" to improve its image - which he linked to relationships between \"certain members of the family and the tabloid press\".\n\nThe prince contrasted the lack of a royal response to the Clarkson article with the events that followed an encounter at Buckingham Palace between Lady Susan Hussey and Ngozi Fulani, just three weeks earlier.\n\nWhile attending an event, Ms Fulani - a black British charity founder - was challenged repeatedly by Lady Hussey about where she was \"really from\".\n\nThe controversy that followed produced a rapid apology.\n\nPrince Harry defended Lady Hussey, saying \"she had never meant any harm at all\". But he contrasted the reconciliatory meeting held between her and Ms Fulani at Buckingham Palace with the response to Prince Harry and Meghan's complaints.\n\nPrince Harry also gave an interview to Anderson Cooper for 60 Minutes on CBS News, which aired a few hours after ITV's show, and saw him speaking about Camilla, the Queen Consort, and her relationship with the media.\n\nCooper asked the duke about comments he made in his memoir suggesting that Camilla would be \"less dangerous\" if she was happy.\n\nPrince Harry said Camilla's need to \"rehabilitate her image\" and her \"willingness\" to forge relationships with the British press made her dangerous.\n\n\"And with a family built on hierarchy, and her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that.\"\n\nThe ITV interview had also returned to Prince Harry and Meghan's previous claim - made in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey - that a member of the Royal Family had raised questions about the skin colour of their future child.\n\nPrince Harry again did not name the individual - and suggested this might have been a case of \"unconscious bias\" rather than racism.\n\nAsked if he would see the questioning as racist, he said: \"I wouldn't, not having lived within that family.\"\n\nHe rejected that he had accused members of the Royal Family of racism in the Oprah interview, saying the \"British press had said that\".\n\nPrince Harry made repeated criticisms of the tabloid press - saying that it was his \"life's work\" to change the media landscape.",

Lady Hussey ultimately resigned as a lady of the household.\n\nPrince Harry, speaking to interviewer Tom Bradby ahead of the publication of his memoir Spare this Tuesday, defended Lady Hussey, saying \"she had never meant any harm at all\".\n\nBut he pointed to the contrast between the treatment given to Ms Fulani and to his wife after the language used about her by Jeremy Clarkson.\n\nPrince Harry also gave an interview to Anderson Cooper for 60 Minutes on CBS News, which aired a few hours after ITV's show, and saw him speaking about Camilla, the Queen Consort, and her relationship with the media.\n\nCooper asked the duke about comments he made in his memoir suggesting that Camilla would be \"less dangerous\" if she was happy.\n\nPrince Harry said Camilla's need to \"rehabilitate her image\" and her \"willingness\" to forge relationships with the British press made her dangerous.\n\n\"And with a family built on hierarchy, and her on the way to being Queen Consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that.\"\n\nThe ITV interview returned to Prince Harry and Meghan's previous claim - made in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey - that a member of the Royal Family had raised questions about the skin colour of their future child.\n\nPrince Harry again did not name the individual - and suggested this might have been a case of \"unconscious bias\" rather than racism.\n\nAsked if he would see the questioning as racist, he said: \"I wouldn't, not having lived within that family.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHe rejected that he had accused members of the Royal Family of racism in the Oprah interview, saying the \"British press had said that\".\n\nThe wide-ranging interview also discussed the tensions that followed Meghan's introduction into the Royal Family.\n\nBradby said there was an impression that Prince William and Catherine \"almost from the get-go\" did not \"get on\" with Meghan.\n\nAsked if that was a fair observation, Prince Harry replied: \"Yeah, fair.\"\n\nPrince Harry said he and Meghan had been portrayed as the \"new kids on the block\" who had threatened to \"steal the limelight\" from other royals - and that led to problems in those relationships.\n\nOf brother Prince William and his wife Catherine, he said: \"I always hoped that the four of us would get on.\n\n\"But very quickly it became Meghan versus Kate.\n\n\"And that, when it plays out so publicly, you can't hide from that,\" he told Bradby.\n\nIn the 95-minute interview, he recalled the days when he was the \"third wheel\" at official engagements and other outings - but his relationship with Prince William and Catherine was particularly warm at that time.\n\nHe imagined that would continue when he found his own partner and they became a foursome, but it was not to be.\n\nHe said stereotypes about Meghan - as an \"American actress, divorced, biracial\" - were heightened by a hostile press.\n\nAnd those stereotypes about the new woman in his life had been a barrier to his brother and sister-in-law \"welcoming her in\" to the family.\n\nPrince Harry said that while Prince William never tried to dissuade him from marrying Meghan he did \"air some concerns\" and warned Harry: \"This is going to be really hard for you\".\n\n\"I still to this day don't truly understand which part\u2026 he was talking about. But maybe, you know, maybe he predicted what the British press's reaction was going to be.\"\n\nIn the CBS interview, Cooper asked Prince Harry about claims he made in his memoir that unspecified members of the Royal Family were uneasy towards Meghan when she was first introduced to them.\n\nAsked what that \"mistrust\" was based on, Prince Harry said: \"The fact that she was American, an actress, divorced, black, bi-racial, with a black mother.\n\n\"Those were just four of the typical stereotypes that becomes a feeding frenzy for the British press.\"\n\nThe prince said the Royal Family reads the tabloids, adding: \"So whether you walk around saying you believe it or not it's still leaving an imprint in your mind.\n\n\"So if you have that judgement based on a stereotype right at the beginning, it's very, very hard not to get over that.\"\n\nAs was typical at that time in 2016, Harry appeared at the Patron's Lunch celebrations for the Queen's 90th birthday alongside Catherine and William\n\nIn the ITV interview, Harry also spoke of the emotional impact of the death of his mother and in his book describes returning to the scene of the car accident in Paris - and asking to be driven through it at the same speed as she was in 1997.\n\nHe said he had always imagined the tunnel as being \"some treacherous passageway\" but \"it was just a short, simple, no-frills tunnel\".\n\nHe saw no point in reopening inquiries into the car accident - but questioned the official conclusions about the night of the crash.\n\nA 2008 inquest found Diana was unlawfully killed partly due to the \"gross negligence\" of her driver who had been drunk and driving at excessive speed.\n\nPrince Harry also said that, after Diana's death, he and his brother William were sat down in a room and told that the events leading to the car crash were \"like a bicycle chain\".\n\n\"If you remove just one of those links from the chain, the end result doesn't happen,\" Harry recalled being told.\n\nWhen William asked what might have happened had the paparazzi not been chasing Diana's car, he was told that \"the result wouldn't have been the same.\"\n\nThe interview was recorded in California, where Prince Harry lives with his family\n\nDuring the interview, Harry also expressed his hope that he might one day reconcile with his father and brother.\n\n\"Forgiveness is 100% a possibility, because I would like to get my father back. I would like to have my brother back,\" he said.\n\n\"At the moment, I don't recognise them, as much as they probably don't recognise me.\"\n\nHe blamed the tabloid press as the \"antagonist\", who he said \"want to create as much conflict as possible\".\n\nThe ITV interview is the first of four broadcast appearances to be aired over the coming days to promote Spare - but all the others were in the US.\n\nAs well as Anderson Cooper from CBS News, he spoke to Michael Strahan of Good Morning America, for a show that will be broadcast later on Monday. He will also appear as a guest on Stephen Colbert's Late Show on CBS on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough Spare is not due to be published until Tuesday, extracts were leaked after some copies went on sale early in Spain. BBC News has obtained a copy and has been translating it.\n\nKensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have both said they will not comment on the contents of the book.",

The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US.",

            "content": "In the hours after rioters tore through Brazil's most important democratic institutions, residents of an affluent Bolsonaro-voting area of Brasilia could still hear sirens in the distance.\n\nDespite the sudden ferocity of the violence few were surprised.\n\nThrough apartment windows, you could see the glare of TV screens showing the news and violence at the presidential palace.\n\n\"It's a sad, sad day for Brazil. Unfortunately, I'm not surprised at all,\" said Victor, 28, a cafe kiosk worker.\n\nHe said he had been expecting some sort of similar action before New Year's, when President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was inaugurated, and he described how more and more people - including his own brothers - had become sucked into \"populist lies\" and \"divisive\" politics.\n\nWhen he heard the news in the afternoon, he said he was afraid, knowing that he was in a largely pro-Bolsonaro area.\n\nSome of his regulars, Lula-voting neighbours in the apartments nearby, had even come down and offered him shelter in their apartments if the riots got closer.\n\n\"They said I could knock on their door!\" he said but he had decided nervously to wait it out.\n\nOutside the famous Our Lady of Fatima church just around the corner, a few people were praying, kneeling in the last pews even as the church custodian went to shut the lights off.\n\nA woman outside the church told me she was struggling to get home because the subways had been suspended and the central bus station was also closed because it is in the blocked off central district.\n\nShe grew more emotional as she spoke about the violence.\n\n\"Brasilia is a non-political city, it's just the city that I live in and where I go about my day-to-day life. But at the same time, it's also a political city. And we live in these two parallel cities,\" she said, wishing to remain unnamed.\n\n\"So today it was sad to see Brasilia as a non-political city suffering aggressions because of its political side.\"\n\nOne of the men who had been praying told me it was a minority of people who wanted the riots and violence.\n\n\"But that's not what democracy is about. There will be winners and losers,\" said Oswald, 50.\n\n\"Winners will govern the country, losers have to accept, and the country will continue to grow and develop.\n\n\"I don't protest, I'm totally against what those people are doing. But my fear is to speak with someone who doesn't understand and is unwilling to understand others' views and I end up getting attacked. Because it ended up happening today.\"\n\nAnother young man I spoke to tonight in the neighbourhood identified as a Bolsonaro supporter but shook his head at the violence.\n\n\"I voted for Bolsonaro, but I don't agree with what they're doing,\" Daniel Lacerda, 21, told me.\n\nHe told me about the frustration people felt with the problems of corruption in Brazilian politics - and the rampant poverty in so many parts of the country.\n\n\"It's sad to think that we've come to this point where people think the only solution is violence. That's really sad. I don't feel happy in any way. I think there are other ways to solve this.\"\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.",

The docs and nurses at Buffalo General have already made me feel at home!\"\n\nThe American football community rallied in support of Hamlin, raising millions of dollars for charity in his name before making tributes at NFL matches when play resumed at the weekend.\n\nHe added on Twitter : \"Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart. Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling. The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world n more. Bigger than football!\"\n\nThe most poignant show of support for Hamlin came in the Bills' return to action on Sunday, when they beat the New England Patriots at home to clinch second seed in the AFC for the play-offs.\n\n'It's up to Damar' - doctor on Hamlin's chances of NFL return\n\nDr Knight, who accompanied Hamlin from UCMC to the airport before his transfer to Buffalo, believes it is too early to say whether the Bills player could resurrect his NFL career.\n\n\"It's entirely too premature to discuss his football, we're focused on his day-to-day recovery,\" Dr Knight told reporters during a briefing.\n\n\"He still has a ways to go in terms of his recovery. We're thrilled where he is today. But in terms of any kind of conjecture about his future, that's still significantly into the future. It's going to be up to Damar.\"\n\nTimothy Pritts, a physician at UCMC, said they had not yet determined the cause of his cardiac arrest .\n\n\"We anticipate that he will undergo an ongoing series of tests and evaluations,\" he added, predicting a normal recovery time could range from \"weeks to months\".\n\n\"He appears to be neurologically completely intact and there's no reason to believe that he won't continue his path to recovery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bengals coach Zac Taylor described Hamlin's return to Buffalo as \"unbelievable\".\n\n\"I mean, just think about it - that was one week,\" he said. \"There's no one in this room that would have expected he'd be in Buffalo.

            "description": "The government will replace the current scheme at the end of March with a less generous one.",
            "section": "Business",
            "content": "A new scheme to support firms with their energy bills will be announced in the House of Commons on Monday.\n\nThe current scheme which caps the unit cost of gas and electricity for all businesses expires at the end of March.\n\nIt will be replaced with a new scheme that offers a discount on wholesale prices rather than a fixed price.\n\nVery heavy energy-using sectors, such as steel, glass and ceramics, are expected to get a larger discount than others, Treasury sources said.\n\nThe BBC understands the definition of what counts as an energy-intensive user will also be broadened as part of Monday's announcement.\n\nThe business group, the CBI, has been calling for sectors including car manufacturing and chilled food processing to be included in the definition.\n\nLast week, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told industry leaders that the current scheme to support businesses was \"unsustainably expensive\".\n\nThe energy support scheme is mainly used by businesses, but is also for charities, and public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals.\n\nFirms have been warning of a \"cliff-edge\" when the current support stops at the end of March, and the new scheme is expected to run until March 2024 to avoid this.\n\nBut the total level of government support is expected to fall sharply - by more than half - from the \u00a318.4bn the current six-month scheme is estimated to have cost by the time it ends.\n\nThis is partly due to wholesale energy prices falling very sharply in recent months.\n\nEuropean gas reserves have held up better than expected thanks to an unusually mild winter in northern Europe.\n\nWholesale gas prices are now below the level they were before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but still three to four times higher than their long-term average.\n\nAnnette Dolan, managing director at Bath Aqua Glass, a glass-blowing company, said that even with the fall in prices she is looking at an annual energy bill of \u00a3119,000 a year. \"And that's before they put the standing charge on so it is still unobtainable,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe said that the government should have capped wholesale prices from the beginning, and she warned that if prices don't come down further she will have to start letting staff go.\n\n\"I'm going to have to work with the smallest amount of people to keep going because that's the only way a small business can keep going.\"\n\nAll businesses can expect their energy bills to rise after March. However, Matt Snell, chief executive at Gusto Restaurants, told the BBC that the current help from the government \"has not really touched the sides\".\n\nHe said his company normally spends around \u00a3750,000 on energy a year. \"And even with the so-called government support in place our bill went up by over \u00a3800,000 so it is forecast to be \u00a31.5m for this year,\" he said.\n\nHe questioned whether providing a discount on wholesale prices would help businesses who face other major energy costs. He said that energy companies are asking for \"ridiculous\" deposits to enter into contracts with businesses: \"We ourselves at Gusto had to pay \u00a3150,000 just to enter a contract.\"\n\nMeanwhile the cost of actually delivering energy to businesses was high and he called for Ofgem, the regulator, to get involved.\n\n\"What a lot of people don't understand is that the cost for delivery to your building can almost double what the wholesale cost of gas is and that is completely unregulated,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time that help for businesses is changed, government support for households will become less generous.\n\nThe bill for a typical household could rise from \u00a32,500 a year to \u00a33,000 a year from April - although energy analysts cautiously forecast that average bills may fall to \u00a32,800 a year next October if current market conditions continue.\n\nThat would be a crumb of comfort for households and could save the government billions in subsidies.\n\nBut the bottom line is that energy prices are going up this year for businesses at the same time as their customers' incomes are being squeezed even further.",

            "section": "UK Politics",
            "content": "Let's be blunt: we are not wildly closer to all these strike rows being sorted out than we were.\n\nBut it is also true that we were never likely to be, after a series of short meetings between trades union officials and government ministers earlier.\n\nThe tone, though, has undeniably shifted, on the government side and among at least some of the unions.\n\nMinisters continue to hint, both publicly and privately, that they might be willing to compromise - although the details of how they might do this don't appear worked through yet.\n\nIt is worth remembering the basis upon which today's talks between ministers and unions were convened.\n\nIt was to talk about what pay might look like in the next financial year starting in April - not the pay striking workers are receiving now, which in many instances is the root cause of the current industrial action.\n\nBut what was also hinted at over the weekend by the prime minister publicly, and other government sources privately, was that there may be scope to do something about pay now.\n\nCould a one-off hardship payment in various sectors caught up in industrial action be an option?\n\nIt is an idea being explored by the Labour government in Wales, and it is not being instantly dismissed at Westminster for England any more.\n\nAn idea that just a few short weeks ago before Christmas was flatly rejected by Downing Street and the Treasury, having been floated by Health Secretary Steve Barclay, now appears to be back in play.\n\nAnd here's another idea being discussed: backdating any pay deal for the next financial year to the start of this calendar year, giving workers another three months at whatever rate they secure in the pay settlement now being worked on.\n\nBoth of these options would allow ministers to say they haven't reopened the existing pay settlement, but would also allow them to say they have listened to what the trades unions are saying.\n\nBut they are, at least as things stand, signals of potential intent, rather than anything more concrete.\n\nHow much would a one-off payment be? \"A few hundred quid? No way. A thousand quid? Well, maybe we'd be getting somewhere,\" one union source suggested to me.\n\nWhat would be the level of pay backdated to the beginning of this year? We, and the unions, don't know.\n\nAmbulance worker strikes are set to continue later this week\n\nAll of this illustrates a subtlety playing out on both sides. There can be disagreements within government.\n\n\"A settlement needs to be arranged, and quickly,\" said one government source, pointing out there is always a resolution in the end, so it made sense to do one sooner rather than later to minimise the damage strike action can cause.\n\nAnother emphasised that the central truth, as they saw it, is there isn't any money left in government coffers and plenty of workers in sectors without a big union presence are struggling, so why should they cave into union demands?\n\nAnd, yes, there are disagreements, or at the very least differences of emphasis, between trades unions: Unite were much more angry and condemning of the government after the meeting at the Department of Health than Unison were.\n\nBut all this also highlights some simple, bald truths.\n\nThere are industrial disputes playing out in different nations of the UK, in different sectors, involving different unions and different governments. Plenty, in all the nations, look rather difficult to sort out.\n\nAs far as England is concerned, after this set of meetings, the strikes that were already in the diary are still in the diary.\n\nNext, the government moves onto the other side of its approach: introducing a new law to attempt to limit their impact in half a dozen different sectors.\n\nThe bill, the planned new law to do this, is to be published, with Business Secretary Grant Shapps heading out and about to make the case for it.\n\nA pragmatic response to strike action in some of our most vital public services? Or a draconian limitation on the capacity of workers to legally withdraw their labour?",

Just two years later, the Montreal Protocol was signed - with 46 countries promising to phase out the harmful chemicals.\n\nThe deal later became the first UN treaty to achieve universal ratification, and almost 99% of banned ozone-depleting substances have now been phased out.\n\nThe Antarctic ozone hole continued expanding until 2000, after which its area and depth began improving slowly.\n\nNow, a report co-produced by UN, US and EU agencies says the Montreal Protocol is working as hoped.\n\nIt says that, if current policies are maintained, the ozone layer will be restored to 1980 values - before the ozone hole appeared - at different points in different places:\n\nWhile the depletion of ozone is harmful due to solar radiation, it is not a major cause of climate change.\n\nBut saving the ozone layer has had a positive knock-on effect on global warming, the report suggests, because some of the harmful chemicals that were phased out are powerful greenhouse gases.\n\nThat phase-out will have prevented up to 1C of warming by the middle of the century - if compared to increasing their use by 3% per year, the scientists found.\n\nWhile the report has been hailed as good news - and evidence that rapid, international action to avert environmental crises can work - it warns that continued progress on the ozone layer is not guaranteed.\n\nFor example, proposals to limit global warming by sending millions of tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere - known as stratospheric aerosol injection - could drastically reverse the ozone layer's recovery.",

            "content": "Tenants in properties owned by private landlords have faced the highest rise in rent since comparable records began seven years ago, official data shows.\n\nRents rose 4% last year as landlords, who face their own squeeze from higher mortgage rates, passed on those costs.\n\nA quarter of tenants surveyed in December said their rent had risen in the past six months, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\n\nRenters proportionally spend more on housing costs than owners do.\n\nOn average, they pay 24% of their weekly expenditure on housing compared with 16% by those with a mortgage, the ONS said, based on the latest figures from 2021.\n\nMyron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said: \"Higher rents have been accompanied by higher energy bills which continues to squeeze budgets.\n\n\"It is a tricky situation if you are looking for a new tenancy. Many renters could decide to remain in existing tenancy agreements with fixed rents, rather than risk a move and spend more on rent.\"\n\nA growing proportion of people said they were finding it difficult to afford their rent or mortgage payments, rising from 27% in late September to 31% in mid-December.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. What can you do about rent increases? Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.\n\nA higher proportion (45%) of adults with mortgages reported being worried about the changes in mortgage interest rates.\n\nThere has been a steep rise in mortgage costs in 2022, driven in part by the doomed mini-budget during the premiership of Liz Truss. Rates surged as the markets reacted unfavourably to promises of tax cuts without an explanation of how they would be funded.\n\nThe average cost of a new, two-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen slowly since markets stabilised, but is still much higher than it was last year at 5.78%.\n\nThe ONS points out that many thousands of homeowners face sharply higher mortgage costs when their current fixed-rate deal expires.\n\nThe ONS said that more than 1.4 million households would be renewing their fixed-rate mortgage this year, with 57% of them currently paying an interest rate of less than 2%. This renewal peak will come between April and June when 371,000 deals expire.\n\nShould the interest rate on a \u00a3100,000 capital and repayment mortgage, borrowed over 25 years, increase from 2% to 6%, then the monthly repayment would jump by \u00a3220, the ONS said.\n\nThe same increase on a \u00a3300,000 mortgage would see monthly repayments rise by \u00a3661.\n\nThe impact of higher mortgage rates is not only hitting those who are re-mortgaging, but also the prospects of first-time buyers.\n\nOne young family told the BBC how they had put their home-buying plans on hold, despite having two good jobs and having saved for a deposit for five years.\n\nKathryn Yabsley and her husband David saw their potential mortgage bill soar in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We had that excitement and thrill. So to just be shot down, I was in bits and my husband was disappointed too. It burst our bubble,\" said 29-year-old Mrs Yabsley, an NHS therapy assistant from Pembrokeshire.\n\n\"We're holding off to see if the rates go down and we're going to rent instead.\n\n\"I don't want to just survive, I want to live as well.\"\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.

            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Rishi Sunak says he will talk to nurses about pay\n\nRishi Sunak's openness to talks has offered a \"chink of optimism\" that a deal can be reached over nurses' pay, the head of the nursing union has said.\n\nThe prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was open to a pay deal that is \"responsible\" and \"affordable\".\n\nPat Cullen, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"The prime minister talked about coming to the table. Now that's a move for me.\"\n\nBut she said strikes will go ahead as this year's pay was still in dispute.\n\nThe health secretary is due to hold a meeting with unions on Monday, but the government has so far only agreed to discuss a settlement for the next financial year.\n\nNurses are already set to receive a rise for the current year, 2022-23, an average of 4.75%. This is in line with a recommendation by the independent NHS Pay Review Body in July - but the RCN says the figure is not enough to cushion the rising cost of living.\n\nIn an interview on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Sunak was asked if he would be willing to talk about nurses' pay for this year.\n\n\"The government has always been clear that it's happy to talk about pay that is responsible, that's affordable for the country. That's always been clear,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to have a reasonable, honest, two-way conversation about pay and everything else that is relevant.\n\n\"The most important thing is that we are talking.\"\n\nLast month saw nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland stage a walkout for the first time in the RCN's 106-year history. The Royal College of Nursing Scotland says it is planning industrial action while the RCN has announced further strike dates in England on 18 and 19 January.\n\nThe RCN has said nurses should receive a pay increase of 5% above inflation this year, which at the peak rate of inflation would have equated to a 19% rise, although reports last week suggested it would accept 10%.\n\nMr Sunak said: \"We are about to start a new pay settlement round... we're about to start that independent process, and before that process starts the government is keen to sit down with the unions and talk about pay and make sure they understand where we're coming from.\"\n\nSpeaking on the same programme, Ms Cullen repeated her call for the prime minister to meet her \"halfway\", and said the RCN had made a \"significant move\" by signalling a willingness to compromise.\n\n\"There was a chink of optimism and there was a little shift in what the prime minister was saying,\" she said.\n\n\"However, and this is really important, tomorrow's meeting... is not about negotiations, it's not about nurses' pay, and it's not addressing the issues that are our dispute.\n\n\"The prime minister talked about coming to the table. Now that's a move for me. But it must be about addressing pay for 2022-23.\"\n\nAhead of Monday's meeting, Health Secretary Steve Barclay suggested health workers could get a bigger pay rise in the next financial year if they agree to \"efficiency\" savings in the NHS.\n\nMr Sunak was also asked about the growing numbers of people waiting for treatment and whether the NHS was in a crisis.\n\nThe prime minister, who hosted a forum of health leaders and experts on Saturday to discuss how key issues in the health service could be addressed, said: \"The NHS is undeniably under enormous pressure.\n\n\"But actually I came away from all my meetings with a renewed sense of confidence and optimism that we can get to grips with this problem.\n\n\"We've got a plan that we've got in place that we're making sure that we can actually deliver.\"\n\nHe repeatedly refused to reveal whether he uses private healthcare, saying the question was \"not really relevant\" to his role as prime minister.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: We will phase out GP running practices - Labour's Wes Streeting\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the NHS was \"not just on its knees, it's on its face\".\n\nHe said a Labour government would implement a 10-year plan to reform the health service but defended his backing of the use of the private sector to lower NHS waiting lists.",

Those plans will aim to deal with ambulance queues by creating areas for vehicles to manoeuvre, and also funding discharge areas in hospitals so patients can be moved out of acute beds.\n\nThe package comes at a time when a spike in Covid and flu infections is putting severe pressure on the NHS, on top of a backlog caused by the pandemic.\n\nA&E waits and ambulance delays are at their worst levels on record.\n\nIn a speech last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said bringing down NHS waiting lists was one of his top priorities this year.\n\nMr Sunak and Mr Barclay hosted health leaders in Downing Street for emergency talks on Saturday, as A&E units struggle to keep up with demand, and trusts and ambulance services declare critical incidents.",

            "content": "Most train services are back to normal on Monday, for the first time since Christmas.\n\nBut one train operator, Chiltern Railways, is still warning passengers to expect disruption.\n\nThe main strike action on Monday is by driving examiners.\n\nLooking ahead, ambulance workers in England and Wales will strike for 24 hours on Wednesday.\n\nSome bus drivers, and teachers in Scotland, will also strike this week.\n\nWe'll bring you another update on Tuesday to explain how these may affect you.\n\nYou can read more or watch this report about why people are taking strike action, and below you can find information on how it could affect you.\n\nMonday and Tuesday this week will be affected by ongoing strikes by driving examiners over pay, pensions, jobs and redundancy terms.\n\nStrike action is continuing at test centres in London, south-east England, south-west England and Wales.\n\nThe action, by members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union means some practical tests will not take place, although theory tests should go ahead.\n\nCar, motorcycle, lorry, bus and minibus tests are among those that may be affected, according to the DVSA.\n\nIf your driving test is due to take place on Monday, you can check here whether your test centre is affected.\n\nNot all examiners are members of the PCS union so your test may go ahead as planned.\n\nUnless you are told your test is definitely cancelled, you should still turn up.\n\nIf your test is cancelled because of the strike, the DVSA will automatically rebook your test for you.\n\nWorkers at the DVLA will launch a five-day strike on Monday over pay, pensions and jobs.\n\nMembers of the PCS union based in Swansea and Birmingham will be taking action.\n\nSome 600 workers who are responsible for things like maintaining the database of everyone's driving record and of all of the vehicles in the UK, are expected to take part.\n\nIt forms part of the union's national campaign after 100,000 civil servants in 124 government departments voted for action.\n\nAmbulance workers in England and Wales will strike for 24 hours on Wednesday.\n\nServices in London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West of England will take action over pay and staffing.\n\nThe strikes will each last for 24 hours from midnight, the Unison union has said, and will involve all ambulance employees, not just 999 response crews.\n\nLife-threatening calls to 999, as well as the most serious emergency calls, will still be responded to, the union has said.\n\nTeachers in Scotland will also strike on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Abellio bus drivers will strike on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nGovernment ministers are due to meet a number of unions on Monday for talks, including teachers unions and health unions. These meetings will be about pay next year.\n\nCurrently there are no further rail strikes scheduled. Meetings between the rail minister, industry representatives and union leaders will take place on Monday in a bid to break the deadlock over pay and conditions.\n\nHow are you affected by the strikes? Are you taking part in strike action? You can email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.\n\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

            "content": "Could a one-off payment to striking workers be the way to resolve all this industrial action?\n\nI reported before Christmas that it was an idea doing the rounds within government and among senior trades unionists.\n\nBut it all went quiet. There didn't seem to be appetite for it in Downing Street or the Treasury.\n\nNow, it appears to be back.\n\nThe Guardian is reporting that the idea is in the mix for striking health workers.\n\nI am told it is not a fully worked up plan, but tellingly it is not being dismissed out of hand, and senior figures talk in terms along the lines of \"there may be scope\" to consider ideas like this if compromises come from the unions.\n\nThis morning, union leaders are heading to meet ministers in Westminster.\n\nThe formal agenda for the meetings of health unions with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, and education unions with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, is next financial year's pay settlements, rather than this year's, which have led to strikes among nurses and ambulance workers or the prospect of them in schools in England and Wales from next month.\n\nSenior government figures say it is not a negotiation that is happening today, but an information sharing exercise about what factors are feeding into the government's calculations for what those pay awards should be.\n\nBut senior union voices tell me they sense a snicket of opportunity for movement on this year's deal given the prime minister's language when he was talking to Laura Kuenssberg over the weekend.\n\nTo put it gently, Rishi Sunak was at least a hop and a step away from crystal clarity about what he was saying, but unions publicly and privately took some encouragement from what he said.\n\nA one-off payment may allow both sides to save face.\n\nThe government could say that it hasn't reopened the pay deal. The unions could point to a win from their campaigning.\n\nAnd there are those in the trades unions who appear open to it.\n\nBut there are a million questions.\n\nHow much would a one off payment be? To whom? By when?\n\nWould it be politically tenable to offer it to some striking workers and not to others?\n\nNurse union leader Pat Cullen has said there is \"a chink of optimism\" ahead of talks with the government\n\nAs union leaders head into their meetings, one tells me they fear today amounts to \"smoke and mirrors\" - it is an invite they can't turn down, for fear of looking churlish, but they fear it might not add to anything concrete, at least yet.\n\nOn the government side, there is a nervousness that industrial action on this scale, and with no prospect of ending, poses the most awkward question to ministers - who is in charge?\n\nSome fear the unions smell weakness in government and are determined to capitalise on it, hence ministers' desire to give the impression of being pragmatic and wanting to talk.\n\nThis is the latest staging post in a tussle between unions and the government that has plenty of mileage in it yet.",

            "section": "Scotland politics",
            "content": "No politician in power wants to say it out loud, but it is a fact that patients are dying because of poor quality care in the ailing National Health Service.\n\nThe Royal College of Emergency Medicine has estimated that delays in emergency care are costing up to 500 lives a week throughout the UK, including perhaps 40 a week in Scotland.\n\nCritics say the health service is struggling because of staff shortages, a lack of social care places for patients waiting to leave hospital, and because it has among the lowest levels of critical care beds in the rich world.\n\nThe situation is grim throughout the UK, and indeed beyond, but here in Scotland it's Nicola Sturgeon's SNP which has been in power since 2007, so it was the first minister who faced the cameras in Edinburgh.\n\nMs Sturgeon accepted that the NHS was under pressure even before the pandemic struck in 2020 but she attempted to defend her record as health secretary and first minister.\n\nShe pointed to spending on additional care home places and insisted that an additional 20,000 health staff had been hired in the past 15 years.\n\nHowever, she did not mention that the latest NHS Scotland workforce figures also refer to 6,319 nursing and midwifery vacancies.\n\nMs Sturgeon suggested that the number of critical care beds needed in advanced societies had reduced over time because of improvements in medicine.\n\nThe doctors' union, the BMA, says however that the UK as a whole is lagging far behind comparable countries.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon faced questions at a briefing in Edinburgh\n\nThe first minister pointed out that her budget was constrained by Westminster, but neglected to add that public spending per head was \u00a31,963 per person higher than the UK average in 2021/22, according to statistics endorsed by her own government.\n\nThe SNP leader also came under repeated questioning about the grim assessment of the state of Scotland's hospitals set out by Dr Lailah Peel, deputy chair of BMA Scotland, who had told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show that patient safety was now \"at risk every day\" in the country's A&E departments.\n\nThe first minister did her best to suggest she did not agree without criticising the professional judgment of a senior Scottish doctor.\n\nStanding alongside Ms Sturgeon, and under even more pressure, was Health Secretary Humza Yousaf. Both the Conservatives and Labour continue to call for his resignation over the government's handling of the NHS crisis.\n\nMr Yousaf's expression was stern as he was asked, very bluntly, whether he was actually up to the job. It remained grim as he listened to his boss defend him.\n\nHealth Secretary Humza Yousaf has been under pressure\n\nThe pressure may ease a little if he can do a deal with the Royal College of Nursing and other unions to avert planned strike action over pay. That will be difficult. As everyone knows money is exceptionally tight and it's not just the NHS which is under pressure.\n\nTaking a step back though, is it time for a more fundamental reassessment of the state of health and social care in Scotland and the rest of the UK?\n\nAs BBC News revealed in November, remarkable discussions have been taking place inside the service about whether it needs to change dramatically in order to survive, with senior NHS leaders in Scotland even discussing the possibility of moving to a \"two-tier\" system.\n\nDescribing a \"billion pound hole\" in the budget, minutes of a high-level meeting suggested it was \"not possible to continue to run the range of programmes\" the NHS currently offers while remaining safe \"and doing no harm\".\n\nThey also contained a warning which critics say was particularly prescient, suggesting that: \"Unscheduled care is going to fall over in the near term before planned care falls over.\"\n\nOpposition parties responded by arguing that in some respects a two-tier system was already here, with those who could afford it (and some who couldn't) paying for private care rather than suffering for months or even years as they wait for the state to help them.\n\nNicola Sturgeon rejected the notion that the NHS was doomed then and she continues to reject it now.\n\nShe insists she is utterly committed to the founding principle of a public health service free for all at the point of need.\n\nShe does, however, accept there is a need for the NHS to \"adapt, change and reform\".\n\nThe first minister, in common with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other politicians throughout the UK, is likely to come under increasing pressure to set out in more detail exactly what that means if the current crisis - and all the misery and death it entails - is not to become a permanent feature of the NHS.",

            "content": "Wales captain Gareth Bale has announced his retirement from football at the age of 33 after a glittering career.\n\nThe nation's most-capped male player and record men's goalscorer announced his decision on social media.\n\nBale, a five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, is arguably Wales' finest ever footballer.\n\n\"After careful and thoughtful consideration, I announce my immediate retirement from club and international football,\" Bale said.\n\n\"I feel incredibly fortunate to have realised my dream of playing the sport I love.\"\n\nCardiff-born Bale's club career took him from Southampton to Tottenham Hotspur and a world record transfer to Spanish giants Real before his move to Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC in June 2022.\n\nHe was his country's talisman as they reached the 2016 and 2020 European Championships before he led Wales at their first World Cup since 1958 at Qatar 2022, ending his international career with 41 goals in 111 appearances.\n\nBale was twice named footballer of the year while at Tottenham, in 2010-11 and 2012-13, and moved to Real for what was then a world-record fee of more than \u00a380m in September 2013.\n\nDuring his time in the Spanish capital, Bale helped Real win three league titles and five Champions League titles - a number no other British player has matched - along with three Club World Cups, three Uefa Super Cups and a Spanish cup.\n\n\"It [football] has truly given me some of the best moments of my life,\" added Bale.\n\n\"The highest of highs over 17 seasons, that will be impossible to replicate, no matter what the next chapter has in store for me.\"\n\nFrom St Mary's to the Bernabeu\n\nBale had joined Tottenham in a deal worth a reported \u00a310m in 2007 having played 45 times for Southampton, scoring five goals.\n\nHaving been used primarily as a left-back in his early career, he really began to thrive in a Spurs shirt when operating further forward, catching the eye especially with a scintillating hat-trick in the Champions League at the San Siro against European champions Inter Milan.\n\nBale's scintillating Spurs form secured the move to Real, where his spell was not always positive despite the fact he scored 104 goals in more than 250 appearances for the club, including two in a match-winning performances in the 2018 Champions League final against Liverpool.\n\nThat was one of five European titles with Real, but injuries and inconsistent form leading to fewer first-team opportunities as his time in Spain went on.\n\nIn 2019, Bale looked on the verge of moving to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning but the proposed transfer broke down, with the forward saying at the time that Real had \"blocked\" the move.\n\nHis relationship with the Spanish giants was further impacted after he celebrated Wales' qualification for Euro 2020 with a Welsh flag emblazoned with the words 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order'.\n\nHe returned to Tottenham on loan in 2021-22 - and scored 17 goals to give him an overall Spurs record of 72 goals in 237 games at a club where he is still adored - before making just seven club appearances for Madrid in the following campaign, his last as a Real player.\n\nAfter his Real contract expired, Bale joined LAFC on a 12-month deal, though his spell in the US was blighted by fitness issues.\n\nBale managed 13 appearances - including only two starts - for LAFC, though he did help the club lift the MLS Cup for the first time in November by scoring a last-minute equaliser in extra time to set up a penalty shootout which his side won.\n\n\"To show my gratitude to all of those that have played their part along this journey feels like an impossibility,\" Bale said.\n\n\"I feel indebted to many people for helping to change my life and shape my career in a way I couldn't have ever dreamed of when I first started out at nine years old.\n\n\"To my previous clubs Southampton, Tottenham, Real Madrid and finally LAFC, all of my previous managers and coaches, backroom staff, team-mates, all the dedicated fans, my agents, my amazing friends and family, the impact you have had is immeasurable.\n\n\"My parents and my sister, without your dedication in the early days, without such a strong foundation, I wouldn't be writing this statement right now, so thank you for putting me on this path and for your unwavering support.\n\n\"My wife and my children, your love and support has carried me through. Right beside me for all the highs and lows keeping me grounded along the way, you inspire me to be better and to make you proud.\n\n\"So I move on with anticipation to the next stage of my life, a time of change in transition and opportunity for a new adventure.\"\n\nWhile he faced criticism at times from Real fans, Bale's contribution was never questioned by Welsh fans.\n\nWales went out of the recent World Cup at the group stage, with their loss to England proving to be the final appearance of Bale's career.\n\nIt was not a fitting end for a player who achieved extraordinary feats with his country.\n\nBale made his Southampton debut as a 16-year-old in April 2006, and his first senior cap followed a matter of weeks later.\n\nThat made Bale Wales' youngest international - although that record has since been broken.\n\nThat first appearance, in a friendly against Trinidad & Tobago in May 2006, marked the start of a Wales career in which Bale inspired his country to the best spell in their history.\n\nHaving ended a 58-year wait for a major tournament appearance by qualifying for Euro 2016, Wales produced a sensational run to the semi-finals, only losing to eventual winners Portugal.\n\nThey also made it to the knockout stages of the next European Championship before last summer's play-off final win over Ukraine saw Wales clinch their long-awaited return to the World Cup.\n\n\"My decision to retire from international football has been by far the hardest of my career,\" Bale said.\n\n\"How do I describe what being a part of this country and team means to me? How do I articulate the impact it has had on my life? How do I put into words the way I felt every single time I put on that Welsh shirt? My answer is that I couldn't possibly do any of those things justice simply with words.\n\n\"But I know that every person involved in Welsh football feels the magic and is impacted in such a powerful and unique way, so I know you feel what I feel without using any words at all.\n\n\"My journey on the international stage is one that has changed not only my life but who I am. The fortune of being Welsh and being selected to play for and captain Wales has given me something incomparable to anything else I've experienced.\n\n\"I'm honoured and humbled to have been able to play a part in the history of this incredible country, to have felt the support and passion of the Red Wall and together have been to unexpected and amazing places.\n\n\"I shared a dressing room with boys that became brothers and backroom staff that became family.\n\n\"I played for the most incredible managers and felt the undying support and love from the most dedicated fans in the world. Thank you to every one of you for being on this journey with me.\n\n\"So for now I am stepping back but not away from the team that lives in me and runs through my veins after all the dragon on my shirt is all I need.\"\n\u2022 None Some of the greatest and most inspiring stories in Welsh football\n\u2022 None The transformation of the Wales football team",

The UK's Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday that Russia was \"likely\" in control of most of Soledar after a months-long battle with Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe British Foreign Office is warning against all travel to Ukraine due to attacks on a number of different cities currently taking place, as the war continues into its 11th month.\n\nIt says there is a \"real risk to life\", adding British nationals still in Ukraine should leave immediately.\n\nThere have been several cases of Britons going missing or being captured in Ukraine over the last year.\n\nLast September, five British nationals who were being held by Russian-backed forces were released after Saudi Arabia said it had brokered an exchange between Russia and Ukraine of 10 detainees.\n\nThis meant Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Dylan Healy, Andrew Hill and Shaun Pinner were all allowed to return home following months of capture.",

            "description": "Fresh accusations emerge in South Africa against former teacher at Boris Johnson's elite prep school.",
            "section": "UK",
            "content": "David Price - who faces trial in South Africa - has also been accused of abusing pupils at Ashdown House in East Sussex\n\nA retired teacher has been charged with sexually assaulting a child after a BBC investigation revealed dozens of allegations about his time at a British school, where he taught future prime minister Boris Johnson.\n\nDavid Price will face trial in South Africa, where he taught after leaving England in the 1980s.\n\nA former pupil in South Africa contacted police in December after learning of the earlier allegations in Radio 4's In Dark Corners series.\n\nJournalist Alex Renton, who was taught by Mr Price, has spoken to six men who allege they were sexually assaulted by the teacher at Ashdown House in East Sussex in the 1970s. There are 42 allegations against him in total.\n\nThe prestigious boarding school was known for preparing boys for Eton College. It was attended by King Charles's cousin, David Linley, now the Earl of Snowdon, along with Mr Johnson. There is no suggestion either were abused at the school.\n\nAfter returning to his native South Africa, Mr Price continued to teach. He was arrested in the country by British police in 2019 and has since been fighting extradition to the UK.\n\nThe latest allegations relate to his time at a prestigious all-boys school in Cape Town in the 1980s.\n\nJournalist Alex Renton was taught by David Price at Ashdown House\n\nThe alleged victim contacted Mr Renton after seeing South African media coverage of the BBC's In Dark Corners series - which investigated sexual abuse at Britain's elite boarding schools.\n\nHe claims he was first groped by the teacher in 1985 at the age of about 10 while showering at Western Province Preparatory School in Cape Town.\n\n\"From that day on he would contrive situations to get me alone,\" he said.\n\nHe said he was made to touch the teacher's genitals.\n\n\"I didn't know what was happening. So I did this and he finished off. And I remember just retching. And he said 'listen, you obviously can't tell anyone, they're not going to believe you'.\"\n\nMr Price left the school in December 1987. A spokeswoman says the school never received any complaints he sexually assaulted children. His career as a teacher continued, including some years at a live-in school for deaf children.\n\nSome former pupils at Ashdown House, who have been waiting to have their allegations heard in a British court, welcomed the action by South African prosecutors.\n\n\"Maybe our best hope is for South Africa to bring him to justice within South Africa because the extradition is not working,\" one said.\n\nAshdown House closed in 2020. The Prep School Trust, which took over the school in 2009, said it had cooperated fully with all enquiries into the allegations and had \"worked tirelessly to ensure no such incidents could ever happen in the school again\".\n\nThe BBC series has also spoken to dozens of former pupils who allege they were abused by teachers at the prestigious Scottish schools Fettes College and Edinburgh Academy.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. For the first time Nicky Campbell discusses the abuse he received at school\n\nAfter listening to the series, BBC presenter Nicky Campbell revealed he had himself been abused at Edinburgh Academy by teacher Hamish Dawson, who has died.\n\nHe said he was haunted by the sight of his friend being abused in the school showers by a different teacher.\n\nThe teacher - who cannot be identified for legal reasons and is referred to as \"Edgar\" in the Radio 4 series - joined Edinburgh Academy in 1968. Five years later he moved to Fettes College. He left in 1979 after being asked to step down.\n\nLike Mr Price, he is also from South Africa, and continued to teach when he returned to the country. He too was arrested in 2019 and has been fighting extradition to the UK.\n\nA court statement from the teacher in 2019 admits to \"inappropriately\" touching boys in the UK, but he denied having done so in South Africa. A later statement in 2021 appears to retract this admission.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to a man who claims he was assaulted by the teacher as a pupil at Rondebosch Boys School in Cape Town, where \"Edgar\" taught from 1980 to 2006.\n\nHe said the teacher would use untidy uniforms as justification to \"have physical contact with you or to have his hands wandering over you\".\n\n\"That would then progress to grabbing me and pushing me up against the wall,\" he said. \"He would push himself up against me.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the school said they had no record of any allegations of misconduct or impropriety involving the teacher. She said she could not confirm the recruitment processes of the time.\n\nA teacher referred to as \"Edgar\" faces multiple allegations of abuse at Edinburgh Academy and Fettes College, pictured\n\nMr Price and \"Edgar\" have the same legal team in South Africa. The BBC asked their lawyers to put the allegations to both men, but did not receive a response.\n\nBoth Western Province Preparatory School and Rondebosch Boys School have now written to alumni urging them to come forward if they were molested by either teacher.\n\nMore than 30 former pupils who allege physical and sexual abuse at Edinburgh Academy and Fettes College have formed a Whatsapp group to support each other.\n\n\"Along with that sense of solidarity comes a sense of total and utter frustration,\" said Mr Campbell, who is a member of the group.\n\nThe teacher's appeal against extradition is due to be heard in South Africa in March.\n\nFettes College said it had \"co-operated fully with the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, including providing the Inquiry with all documentation pertaining to this matter\".\n\nEdinburgh Academy said it was \"working closely with the relevant authorities including Police Scotland and the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry\".",

Laws for a similar ban in Wales were approved in December and will come into force later in 2023.\n\nThis latest measure does not, however, cover items found in supermarkets or shops. The government said it would address those by other means.\n\nMegan Randles, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said that the organisation welcomed the ban but further action was needed.\n\nShe said: \"We're dealing with a plastic flood, and this is like reaching for a mop instead of turning off the tap.\"\n\nShe called on the government to deliver a \"meaningful\" strategy on how to reduce plastic use, which would also include stringent targets and \"a proper reuse and refill scheme\".",

First Minister Mark Drakeford discusses efforts to avoid a strike by NHS staff\n\nNHS workers in Wales will not be offered bigger increases to their wages, despite talks later this week.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford spelled out his offer to avert further industrial action, including a one-off payment, on Monday.\n\nDespite union demands, he said he was not able to give a higher pay award.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) wants a 19% pay rise and said the one-off payment was not \"satisfactory\" and would not halt strike action.\n\nBut ministers have said that is unaffordable and the Welsh government has written to trade unions inviting them to meet and negotiate.\n\nHelen Whyley, director of the RCN in Wales, welcomed the offer but said \"the devil will be in the detail\".\n\nHealth workers in Cardiff took to picket lines in December to support their nursing colleagues\n\nThe GMB, which represents about a quarter of Welsh Ambulance Service staff, said a payment would not be enough to avert its strike planned for Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the first minister acknowledged parts of the NHS had been in \"crisis\" in recent weeks, and apologised to staff and patients.\n\nBut he said it was \"not a perpetual crisis as some people would suggest\".\n\nThe Welsh government has offered NHS staff a pay rise of between 4% and 5.5%, but the RCN has called for an increase in line with inflation.\n\nTalks between the Welsh government and the health unions are expected to begin on Thursday.\n\nHelen Whyley will meet this week with Health Minister Eluned Morgan\n\nThe RCN's associate director, Nicky Hughes, told BBC Radio Wales that a one-off payment was \"a no-go unless it's substantive\", adding: \"It does not address the 10 years of poor pay rises and the fact that nurses' pay is now 20% less than it should be in relation to inflation.\"\n\nMr Drakeford refused to be drawn on details of the one-off payment, only saying there were three elements in his offer to avert further industrial action, including:\n\nLater on Monday, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the cash offer would \"not be insignificant\", but would not be drawn on whether all staff would get the same payment, saying it would be \"open to negotiation\".\n\nMr Drakeford said the amount of money on the table for pay rises was linked to pay awards in England that triggered extra money for Wales.\n\n\"That is why when we meet our trade union colleagues later this week I'm not in a position to offer them a higher pay award\", he said.\n\nThe first minister said money for the one-off payment was found from the Welsh government's own funds, and reports of the UK government considering a pay-out to nurses in England were \"entirely coincidental\".\n\nThe 27 December was \"probably\" the busiest in the history of the NHS, Mark Drakeford said, and hospital staff would have felt \"that they were dealing with a crisis\".\n\nAmid reports of more money for social care beds in England, he said there was \"money in the system\" for additional care home beds, including 508 additional beds this winter.\n\nHe rejected the idea of field hospitals, saying staffing was a \"real challenge\".\n\nTwo additional strike dates for ambulance staff have been announced for January\n\nMs Whyley said: \"I want to hear a Welsh government who are committed to sorting out the problems of Welsh nurses in Welsh hospitals looking after Welsh people and that means fair pay for those people and an approach that will give them a career across the whole of the time they are nursing in Wales.\"\n\nAfter unprecedented demand on hospitals, the Welsh government advised senior NHS staff to discharge people who are well enough to leave hospital, even if arrangements to care for them at home have not been finalised, in order to ease pressure.\n\nMs Whyley said she was unsure on the details surrounding the offer, such as knowing which health workers would receive the payment or how much that would be, but \"we want to get round the table to see what that might look like\".\n\nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru health spokesman, said it was positive the government was showing willing to come to the table and negotiate, but said the one-off payment \"simply doesn't cut it\".\n\nHe told BBC Wales: \"We are looking here at a situation where pay for our hardworking nurses has been cut in real terms over many years. That needs to be addressed on a permanent basis, not on a one-off.\n\n\"There's been a totally unacceptable delay in an attempt to try to resolve this situation.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the pay offer was \"long overdue recognition that decisions over NHS pay is the responsibility of Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay\".\n\n\"It should not have taken this long to get to this point with nurses, ambulance workers and midwives all voting to take industrial action in Wales,\" he added.",

            "content": "Peta Cavendish gave evidence in front of Judge David Turner KC at Chelmsford Crown Court\n\nA masked intruder dragged the elite cyclist Mark Cavendish by his feet and held a \"Rambo-style\" knife to his throat, his wife has told a trial.\n\nProsecutors have said men in balaclavas broke into the family home in Ongar, Essex, on 27 November 2021.\n\nTwo suspects deny two counts of robbery at Chelmsford Crown Court.\n\nMr Cavendish's wife Peta, giving evidence at the trial, described the incident as \"everyone's worst nightmare\".\n\nJurors have heard how the suspects made off with two Richard Mille watches, valued at \u00a3400,000 and \u00a3300,000, as well as suitcases and phones.\n\nPeta Cavendish (pictured on another occasion with Mark Cavendish) said the suspects took her husband's \u00a3400,000 watch that he \"raced in\"\n\nRomario Henry, 31, of Bell Green, Lewisham, south east London, and 28-year-old Oludewa Okorosobo, of Flaxman Road, Camberwell, south London, both deny two counts of robbery.\n\nMs Cavendish said she was naked in bed when she was woken by a noise downstairs.\n\n\"As I got a few steps down the stairs I could hear men speaking, but it was still dark,\" said Ms Cavendish.\n\nShe said she then saw \"men's figures in balaclavas\" who ran \"towards the bottom of the stairs\".\n\nMark Cavendish remembered his wife running into their bedroom, with \"figures really close behind her\"\n\nShe described how the suspects followed her into the bedroom, where they \"dragged\" her husband \"from his feet and started punching him\".\n\n\"One of the men then had him in a headlock,\" she said.\n\n\"One of them held a large black knife to his throat and they said 'where's the watches?' and 'do you want me to stab you?'.\"\n\nShe agreed with prosecutor Edward Renvoize that it appeared to be a Rambo-style knife.\n\nA Rambo knife is generally described as a survival knife, with about a dozen saw teeth, as featured in the Rambo film franchise.\n\nPeta Cavendish said her watch, which suspects did not initially notice, was taken from her bedside table\n\nMs Cavendish said the robbers were \"very specific\" about a watch, before taking her husband's watch from a windowsill\n\n\"They were very specific about a watch,\" she said.\n\n\"I tried to explain that actually we were broken into a couple of years previously, everything has been taken.\"\n\nMs Cavendish said they demanded to be shown the safe, but that it was empty, and could not be opened anyway because its battery-operated pin machine \"had gone dead\".\n\nShe said her husband was \"out of hospital for four days maybe\" at the time following a cycling crash which left him with three broken ribs and a tear to his left lung.\n\nProsecutors said the defendants left the property at about 02:25 GMT on 27 November 2021\n\nMs Cavendish said they eventually took the \u00a3400,000 watch \"Mark raced in\", that had a blue strap, which was on a windowsill.\n\nShe said they took her \u00a3300,000 Richard Mille watch from her bedside table.\n\nThey turned the bedroom \"upside down\", she said, and when they left, Mr Cavendish pressed a panic alarm to alert a private security firm and police.\n\nEssex Police believe George Goddard, who is wanted over the alleged robbery, is the man pictured in this shop CCTV image\n\nJo Jobson, who prosecutors say is pictured in this CCTV image, is also wanted by police\n\nMr Cavendish, also giving evidence, described how he had also been naked at the time and one man \"held me\" while another \"pulled out a knife and just held it in my face\".\n\nThe cyclist, who is the joint record holder for winning stages in the Tour de France, told jurors he was a brand ambassador for Richard Mille watches and was sometimes loaned timepieces to wear.\n\nMrs Cavendish, asked about her watch that was stolen, said there was \"only one\", adding: \"It was made for me.\"\n\nMr Cavendish said the two watches were \"provided as part of being an ambassador\".\n\nJurors have been told that Ali Sesay, 28, of Holding Street, Rainham, Kent, admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing.\n\nThe prosecution said fourth and fifth suspects, Jo Jobson and George Goddard, remained at large.\n\nThe trial is expected to conclude by the end of this week.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

            "section": "Europe",
            "content": "There were reports of strikes overnight in Kramatorsk, but Moscow has given no evidence to support its claim it killed hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers\n\nUkraine has labelled as \"propaganda\" a Russian claim that it killed hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers in an attack.\n\nMoscow claimed, without providing any evidence, that a \"mass missile strike\" in the eastern city of Kramatorsk had killed more than 600 Ukrainian forces.\n\nIt said it was in retaliation for a Ukrainian attack on a Russian base that killed dozens of Russian soldiers on New Year's Day.\n\nBut the Ukrainian military says this is untrue.\n\n\"This is another piece of Russian propaganda,\" Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for the Ukrainian army, told the BBC.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it had killed more than 600 Ukrainian servicemen in a strike on buildings temporarily housing Ukrainian forces. More than 1,300 Ukrainian troops were housed in two buildings, Moscow said.\n\nIt called the attacks a \"retaliatory strike\" to avenge the deaths of 89 Russian troops killed in Makiivka. Ukraine says as many as 400 people were killed or wounded in that incident, while numbers into the hundreds have been given by Russian nationalists on social media.\n\nMoscow is yet to offer any proof of its claim about the Kramatorsk deaths.\n\nBy matching pictures of the attack published by local officials to Google satellite imagery and other images online, the BBC has confirmed the location of two sites about a mile apart in Kramatorsk.\n\nThe strikes happened near two school buildings - vocational schools number 28 and 47 - which match with the dormitory numbers provided by Russia. Moscow says the buildings were housing Ukrainian military personnel.\n\nHowever, there's no visual evidence that shows these two buildings were badly hit or that there has been mass deaths on the scale claimed by Russia.\n\nNot that Russia's 36-hour ceasefire remotely resembled a truce, but almost immediately after it ended, we felt seven or so explosions in the city of Kramatorsk.\n\nThe rattle of the windows made us decide to head to the shelter. Until then, we'd only heard faint thuds and a few sirens. This marked a return to the almost daily missile strikes which Kramatorsk has had to endure.\n\nMoscow's truce had only led to the faintest of let ups in the city, which can't be said for the surrounding area.\n\nThe local mayor posted images of damaged buildings and said two educational sites, eight apartment blocks and garages were damaged from the explosions.\n\nThere were no reported casualties, contrary to the claims from the Kremlin.\n\nThere was further shelling in various parts of Ukraine overnight after the end of what Russian President Vladimir Putin said was a 36-hour ceasefire by Russian forces so Orthodox Christians could celebrate Christmas. Evidence suggests this so-called ceasefire was not adhered to by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials said at least one person was killed in the Kharkiv region in the north-east.\n\nExplosions were also reported in the southern cities of Zaporizhzhia and Melitopol.\n\nSeparately, Russia's defence ministry said that Ukraine had returned 50 captured Russian soldiers after negotiations. Kyiv confirmed that it had received the same number of soldiers in return from Russia.",

            "section": "UK",
            "content": "During the first nationwide lockdown in 2020, Tony Stowell was only able to see his mother Antonia through a window at her care home\n\nA man plans to sue a nursing home because, he says, during the pandemic his mother was put on end-of-life care without her family being told.\n\nAntonia Stowell, 87, did not have the mental capacity to consent because she had dementia, say the family's lawyers.\n\nHer son, Tony Stowell, said if end-of-life care had been discussed, he would not have agreed to it.\n\nRose Villa nursing home in Hull says all proper process in Mrs Stowell's care was followed with precision.\n\nMr Stowell said that when he learned of the nursing home's decision, he insisted his mother was moved to a hospital, where she later died.\n\nAs a prelude to legal action, Mr Stowell's lawyers have obtained his mother's hospital records which, they say, show she was diagnosed with suspected pneumonia while living in the home. End-of-life drugs were then prescribed and ordered by medical professionals.\n\nDuring the first pandemic lockdown in 2020, Mr Stowell said that although he was not allowed inside, he visited his mother regularly and would see her through a window, but in May that year, she suddenly seemed to deteriorate.\n\n\"When I looked through the window she was just slumped in her wheelchair,\" he said.\n\n\"Something was just telling me it was different. It didn't look right to me. So I am banging on the windows and the doors and I said 'what's wrong with my mum?'.\n\n\"They said 'it's fine, she's just sleeping'.\n\n\"I said 'it looks like she is dead in there'.\"\n\nThe following day, he said, he was told over the phone by the home that his mother had been put on end-of-life care.\n\nHe said he had to break the news to his equally shocked siblings, and the family insisted their mother was moved to Hull Royal Infirmary hoping she could receive treatment, but she died there the next day.\n\n\"They should have consulted all family members. The care home would always phone each family member if Mum didn't feel well or had a headache. I always got calls from them. This is why I am so angry,\" Mr Stowell said.\n\nIn a statement, Rose Villa said: \"We believe that our dedicated and professional team provided Antonia with the very best care under the direction of her GP and medical team, and all proper process in the delivery of this care was followed with precision.\"\n\nRose Villa nursing home is registered for a maximum of 49 residents, its website says\n\nMr Stowell's lawyers, Gulbenkian Andonian solicitors, said his mother's hospital records reveal the decision to put her on end-of-life care was made two days before the family was told.\n\nIn their letter to the home announcing the planned legal action, they said Mrs Stowell could have had \"48 additional hours on a ventilator with treatment\u2026 with the necessary implication that Antonia Stowell could still be with us today or at least survived\".\n\nThe lawyer dealing with the case, Fadi Farhat, told the BBC: \"As a matter of law, there is a presumption in favour of treatment which would preserve life and prolong life, irrespective of one's age or condition.\n\n\"Therefore to deviate from that presumption means a patient, or family members, should be consulted as soon as that decision is made or contemplated.\"\n\nHe adds: \"What is particularly concerning for me is this case occurred at the height of the pandemic. That should worry everybody because it demonstrates that rights can be suspended in times of crisis, when the very purpose of legal rights is to protect us during times of crisis.\"\n\nMr Stowell has also launched a campaign for an \"Antonia's Law\" to give care home residents the right to have cameras in their rooms so relatives can monitor them.\n\nMr Farhat said other families have now been in touch, saying their relatives were put on end-of-life care without consultation, echoing wider concerns about \"do not resuscitate\" decisions during the pandemic.\n\nIn its statement, Rose Villa added: \"The Covid pandemic has hit the social care sector extremely hard. Despite the numerous challenges this has presented, the team at Rose Villa care home have always strived to provide the very best care for all our residents and are fully committed to delivering the highest level of care now and into the future.\"\n\nMrs Stowell's death certificate said she died from Covid and dementia.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care official said decisions taken for people assessed as lacking mental capacity must be made in their best interests.\n\n\"The Mental Capacity Act places a duty on the decision-maker to consult those interested in the person's welfare where practicable and appropriate,\" the officiial added.",

            "section": "Latin America & Caribbean",
            "content": "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nAbout 1,500 people have been held in Brazil after supporters of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro stormed Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court in the capital Bras\u00edlia.\n\nThe rioting came a week after President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was sworn in.\n\nHe condemned the \"terrorist acts\" and vowed to punish the perpetrators.\n\nMr Bolsonaro has not admitted defeat in October's tight election that divided the nation, and flew to the US before the handover on 1 January.\n\nOn Monday, he was admitted to hospital in Florida with abdominal pain.\n\nDemonstrators in S\u00e3o Paulo marched with a big banner with the words \"We are democracy\" in Portuguese\n\nTens of thousands of people are now demonstrating in Brazil's largest city S\u00e3o Paulo in support of democratic values.\n\nThe turnout is impressive - a part of Paulista Avenue, Brazil's most famous street, is blocked off - as crowds have filled the area, singing, dancing and chanting for justice, reports the BBC's Katy Watson in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThere was however a huge police presence in case of any trouble. At times, the atmosphere has felt tense, our correspondent adds.\n\nThe new president - widely known as Lula - and the heads of Congress and the Supreme Court said they \"reject the terrorist acts and criminal, coup-mongering vandalism that occurred\" during Sunday's riots.\n\nThe dramatic scenes saw thousands of protesters clad in yellow Brazil football shirts and flags overrun police and ransack the heart of the Brazilian state.\n\nOn Monday morning, heavily armed officers started dismantling a camp of Mr Bolsonaro's supporters in Bras\u00edlia - one of a number that have been set up outside army barracks around the country since the presidential election.\n\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Ros Atkins on... Why the Brazil riots happened\n\nAuthorities arrested 1,200 people on Monday - in addition to 300 detained a day earlier.\n\nJustice Minister Flavio Dino said some 40 buses which had been used to transport protesters to the capital had been seized.\n\nThe scale of the damage was still starkly evident on Monday afternoon, even as officials lauded the progress of the clean-up at the presidential palace, reports the BBC's Bernd Debusmann in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nHe says workers were cleaning up broken glass around the building's exterior. Almost every window on the building's ground floor had been damaged, forcing crews to painstakingly remove each pane of glass and replace it with a new one.\n\nThe cobblestone pavement outside the palace also showed signs of damage, with large patches torn out by rioters on Sunday.\n\n\"They were using the rocks as missiles,\" one official said. \"To break the glass.\"\n\nIn the nearby Congress building, the damage included valuable works of art, including several high-profile pieces that were reportedly damaged by water or defaced during the riot.\n\nThe streets, however, were largely calm and devoid of noticeable military or police presence, our correspondent adds.\n\nMr Bolsonaro condemned the attack and denied responsibility for encouraging the rioters in a post on Twitter some six hours after violence broke out.\n\nMeanwhile, Bras\u00edlia Governor Ibaneis Rocha has been removed from his post for 90 days by the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Minister Alexandre de Moraes accused him of failing to prevent the riot and of being \"painfully silent\" in the face of the attack. Mr Rocha has apologised for Sunday's events.\n\nVideo shared by the Brazilian outlet O Globo showed some officers laughing and taking photos together as demonstrators occupied the congressional campus in the background.\n\nDemonstrators were quick to defend their actions when approached by reporters.\n\nLima, a 27-year-old production engineer, said: \"We need to re-establish order after this fraudulent election.\"\n\n\"I'm here for history, for my daughters,\" she told AFP news agency.\n\nOthers in the capital expressed outrage at the violence and said the attack marked a sad day for the country.\n\n\"I voted for Bolsonaro but I don't agree with what they're doing,\" Daniel Lacerda, 21, told the BBC. \"If you don't agree with the president you should just say it and move on, you shouldn't go hold protests and commit all the violence like they're doing.\"\n\nBolsonaro supporters created camps in cities across Brazil, some of them outside the military barracks. That is because his most ardent supporters want the military to intervene and make good elections that they say were stolen.\n\nIt looked like their movement had been curbed by Lula's inauguration - the camps in Bras\u00edlia had been dismantled and there was no disruption on the day he was sworn in.\n\nBut Sunday's scenes show that those predictions were premature.\n\nSome protesters are not just angry that Bolsonaro lost the election - they want President Lula to return to prison.\n\nHe spent 18 months in jail after being found guilty of corruption in 2017. His convictions were later annulled, after initially being sentenced to more than nine years.\n\nHeads of state around the world have also denounced the violence, with the leaders of the US, Canada and Mexico issuing a joint statement on Monday condemning \"attacks on Brazil's democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power\".\n\nLate on Monday, President Joe Biden \"conveyed the unwavering support of the United States for Brazil's democracy\" during a phone call with Lula, the White House said in a statement. It added that the Brazilian leader had accepted Mr Biden's invitation to visit Washington in early February.\n\nComparisons have been drawn with the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by supporters of Donald Trump, an ally of Mr Bolsonaro. Mr Biden was sworn in that day after defeating Mr Trump in presidential elections the previous November.",

            "content": "While Jair Bolsonaro may not have been the mastermind behind the invasion, he cannot be separated from it.\n\nThroughout his term, he has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of Brazil's institutions - accusing the Supreme Federal Court of being politically against him, and the voting system of being prone to fraud, despite no evidence to support those claims.\n\nHis supporters took on his narrative wholeheartedly.\n\nSince he lost the elections in October he flew off to Florida to avoid having to hand over the presidential sash to Lula - and he's allowed his most ardent supporters to remain angry over a democratic election that he legitimately lost.\n\nTension has definitely been building. Camps were set up across the country in front of army headquarters, with protesters loyal to Bolsonaro calling for military intervention. And then in December, supporters set fire to Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia. Another supporter was arrested for allegedly trying to set off a bomb before Lula's inauguration on 1 January.\n\nIt's no secret that many security forces are more on the side of Bolsonaro than Lula.\n\nFor Bolsonaro's supporters, Lula - who was jailed in 2017 for corruption, and spent 18 months in prison before the convictions were annulled - is a corrupt politician who belongs in prison, not the presidential palace.\n\nThey falsely accuse him of being a communist, wanting to impose a regime like Venezuela or Cuba. They won't be convinced by anything else - and they won't give up their fight for \"democracy\" as they call it.\n\nBut there's a massive flaw in their argument in wanting freedom and democracy.\n\nThey are calling for a very undemocratic military intervention to \"save\" Brazil - an intervention that despite their best efforts, doesn't look forthcoming.",
